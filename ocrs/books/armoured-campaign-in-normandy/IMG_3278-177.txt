The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
disrupting the German tanks on 7 August, knocking out seventeen tanks and as-
sault guns plus many more soft vehicles for the loss of twelve guns.
The 746th Tank Battalion was attached to the 9th Division pushing towards
Cherence and Mortain in the sector St Pois to Gathemo and created many of the
difficulties for the 1I6th Panzer Division around Cherence on 6 August and in the
vicinity of Grand Dove.
The 899th Tank Battalion was attached to the gth Division directly in the path of
the German advance. Supporting the infantry of the 39th Regiment, A Company
also fought at Cherence and knocked out five German tanks on 7 August, which
stopped any further German advances northwards.
While the German attack had many shortcomings, a significant factor in is
defeat was the bravery of the US army forces in resisting the attack which, because
of the terrain, did not develop into the massed armour attack planned. Instead it
broke down into a number of small tank-infantry engagements, which were all
won decisively by the Americans.
I he appearance of the 2nd Armored Divisiool on the battlefield was an important
tactical move, though it saw little combat. This division, with the 35th Division,
not only blocked any possible German advance by the easier southern route to
st Millaire but aiso put pressure on the lines of communication through Ger of
the attacking panzer divisions; so when it became evident that the attack had not
artileded, it was stopped by von Kluge. The Allies had learnt that considerable
tillery and air support was needed if advances through the ditticult countryside
were to be successful, and the Germans had neither. Bradley's strategy unfolded ex-
actly as he planned, and the German attack was blunted within hours on 7 August
without imperilling the Third Army, which Eisenhower was even prepared to see
temporarily cut-off:
Bradley and 1, aware that the German counterattack was under preparation carefully
the studion We had sufficient strength in the immediate area so that i we
hose merely to stand on the defensive against the German attack, he could not possi-
bly gain an inch. However, to make absolutely certain of our defence at MORTAIN,
we would have to determine the number of divisions we could have in the enemy rear
ind to sacre our of Portunity to achieve the complete destruction for which we hao
hoped. Moreover, by this time the weather had taken a definite turn for the better,
and we had in our possession an air transport service that could deliver if called upon,
up to 2000 tons of supply per day in fields designated by any of our forces that might
be temporarily cut off.42
