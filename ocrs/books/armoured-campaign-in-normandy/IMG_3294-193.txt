The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
hour late at 1430 hours and
was duly stopped at Quesnay Wood with the loss of
twenty-six tanks.
No attempt seems to have been made to take into account the heavy oppos-
tion being encountered. The German tanks facing the Canadians could have only
come from the I2th SS Panzer Division, and yet again the 4th Armoured Disson
was advancing with just one regiment up front to Point 195. The SS Divison
was reported as being depleted before Operation Totalize and yet had succestully
repelled all attacks so far after inflicting heavy tank losses; Simonds and Kitching
can have only believed that the 12th SS Panzer Division was close to collapse and
they could break through with only one regiment. The existence of the gun line ot
88mm anti-tank guns was again ignored or left to the air forces to deal with. The
Grenadier Guards and the Foot Guards in their Sherman tanks advanced straight
onto an exposed hill surrounded by some of the most powerful anti-tank guns and
tanks that the Germans possessed.
Simonds does not seem to have grasped what had happened after the initial
reccess of phase one, and by neglecting the third line of German defences, he
repeated Dempsey's mistake in Operation Goodwood. The exploitation attacks
by individual regiments of the 4th Armoured Division were easily seen of by
a handle labes, ser Popened guns and anti-tank guns, with considelde di
losses. The British Cabinet documents recorded the following:
Day 1 result
The 2nd Canadian Corps had advanced more than seven kilometres down the
Falaise road onto the main line of enemy defence, nevertheless the momentum of the
attack had been lost.
Later:
t is worth considering whether there was not too much armour, on a limited
front, and whether the objectives for the armour wels not far too limited. Armoured
Divisions should think big! (emphasis in original)?
Once again the British, having made a breakthrough, failed to exploit the gaps
they ta are so much chero did come seating. Once more the Germa
lines were able to reform and stop the British attack but only at the cost of more
irreplacedure men and equipment. the Germans continued to be amazed that
hey were again able to repeat this teat previously performed during Operations
Goodwood and Bluecoat in Operation Totalize.
