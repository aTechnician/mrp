The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944

was forgotten in Overlord, and many lives could have been saved by not using
DD tanks.
After reviewing a forecast of wastage rates, 2Ist Army Group requested that the
forecast wastage rate be increased to 25 per cent a month for tanks ashore for the
first three months of the campaign. 68

From the above table, a total of 185 medium Sherman or M4 tanks were lost from
those that began the assault on 6 June; note that because of the congestion and
fighting inland, some craft loads scheduled to land on D-Day were delayed until
the next day. The average casualty rate for all the armoured units was 36 per cent,
or one tank in three being lost. The wastage rate after one day of fighting was
higher than that forecast for the whole month of June, although this is distorted by
the much higher losses in the DD regiments. Somewhat pessimistically, zist Army
Group had set aside on paper 190 Shermans to replace all the DD tanks, therefore
assuming a 10o per cent wastage rate 169 As many DD tanks survived D-Day, these
gave 2Ist Army Group a significantly higher number of reserve tanks ashore, which
would be needed in the ensuing months.
