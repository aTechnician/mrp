The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
This was not strictly true as the panzer attack had already been cancelled by the
Germans in response to the destruction of Panzer Gruppe West. What is certain is
that it was the efforts and sacrifices of the men of the Canadian 3rd Division and
the 2nd Armoured brigade around Bretteville, Putot and Norrey that consistently
blocked the attacks of the I2th SS Panzer Division in its weak attempts to break
through to the sea during the first week after D-Day. The conversation between
Meyer and von Schweppenburg on 9 June would be prophetic regarding the out-
come of the Normandy campaign for the Germans. The tank battles in the first
week also demonstrated both the vulnerability of the M4 Sherman to the German
high velocity 75mm and 88mm anti-tank guns and the ability of the Sherman
Firefly to match the firepower of the Panther tank. The British decision to mount
the I7-pounder anti-tank gun in the Sherman was beginning to pay dividends.
The lith of June marked the end of the opening phase for the Allies with
their two armies, the British Second Army and FUSA, well established ashore in
Normandy. Not a single threatening counterattack had been made by the feared
verman panzer divisions. With the closure of the gap between Umaha and Utan
on to june, the separate bridgeheads of D-Day now formed a continuous lodgement
all along the front. The construction of the artificial harbours, at Arromanches in
the British sector and St Laurent in the American sector, was well advanced and
Allied aircraft could now operate from temporary airstrips in France to give them
longer flying time over the battlefield. Churchill was so confident of the outcome
of the Normandy campaign that the British Cabinet had already drawn up a draft
of the instrument of German surrender.$º
Although intended to achieve thedoriginal D-Day objectives, the armoured
thrusts inland by the Canadians and British in fact served to keep the Germans
off-balance and forced the commitment of the panzer divisions. As the attacks
continued to be unsuccessful around Caen and Tilly, Montgomery then shifted his
attention further west to Villers Bocage.
