The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
German victory was a pyrrhic one, as the loss of precious tanks contributed to the
gradual whittling away of the effectiveness of the panzer forces in Normandy.
In his notes after Operation Goodwood, O'Connor himself stated that the
second objective of Goodwood was a 'breakthrough the Caen-Falaise plain with
a view to an armoured thrust in the direction of Falaise?" In a post-war interview
with Liddell Hart, Dempsey said:
It was always possible the enemy's resistance might breakdown and it was therefore
necessary to foresee such a situation arising and be mentally prepared for it.
Given the documents and correspondence that have come to light in the last seventy
years, it is quite clear that Goodwood was intended as a breakthrough by Dempsey,
who thought that "an enthralling battle to seize all the bridges was possible??
Montgomery and his supporters continued to play down the failed operation
after the war, even claiming it was part of a deception campaign to keep the
German forces near Caen while the Americans tried to break out. The diversion-
ary operations, the heaviest yet air force bombings, the use of three armoured
divisions and even Montgomery's signal to Brooke all indicate this was a break-out
attempt. Liddell Hart makes the point that Operation Goodwood fell short even
of its limited initial objectives.
The attack failed to capture and hold the high
ground to the south of Caen, which had an adverse effect on subsequent attacks
to the south in support of Operation Cobra, particularly Operation Spring, where
the Canadians were repulsed with heavy losses. Montgomery also failed to destroy
much of the German armour: the attack was held by the Ist SS Panzer Division
with the remnants of the 2ist Panzer Division and the 12th SS Panzer Division in
reserve was not called upon at all on to july. And as for the breakou, day mope o
breaking through and exploiting southwards to Falaise, or beyond, that faded away
on the first day'?8
in total, the Alles had extended their control over an extra 7 miles to taster
Caen and destroyed eighty-three German tanks, for their own loss of 275 tanks and
over S,500 casualties, although many of the tanks were repairable. More than 34 per
cent of the tank strength of the lith Armoured Division was lost.
Probably the biggest post-Goodwood claim of success was that the attack rein-
forced the German view that the British and Canadian forces on the Allied eastern
fank were the most dangerous threat. This resulted in the Germans committing
their remaining reserves to the front around Caen so that the FUSA forces in the
west only faced one and a half panzer divisions compared with the six and a half fac-
ing the British and Canadian armies around Caen. The newly arrived rioth Panzer
Division from the Fifteenth Army in Pas de Calais was committed to Caen, and the
2nd Panzer Division, which was to be withdrawn into reserve at St Lô at Caumont,
was diverted to the area south of Caen." Once Operation Cobra began a week later
and finally breached the thin German defensive 'crust' in the west, few German
mechanised units were available to block the American advance or counterattack.
