Summary
atter ten weeks of hard fighting in Normae dy and the closure of the falaise Gap
by the Americans, French and Canadians, the Germans were in full retreat and the
Normandy campaign was over.
Von Kluge had ordered a general withdrawal over the River Orne on 16 August,
and following his dismissal and replacement by Field Marshal Model on 18 August,
Hider sanctioned a further withdrawal to behind the River Dives and then the
River Tocques on 21 August. However, to uaueat to the liver see by the
German Fifth Panzer and Seventh armies was organised, although beset by severe

given permission to withdraw across the Seine if necessary!'
The Allied armies did not pursue tag au jo ins aggressively, much to the surprise
of the Germans, Who were concerned nur a concerted dudes northwarasy the
Americans to seize all the Raver Seine crossings sour-east or houen would have
cut-oft the escape of the entire army group. Most of the crossings were l the
zone of the Second Army and there were again concerns about American troops

and Canadian Corps was also instructed by Montgomery to advance to the Seine.
Four days later, the American advance had reached Elboeuf and any plans for an
organised German withdrawal were abandoned; all units still west of the river were
ordered to retreat as quickly as possible. The Germans urgently required time to
reorganise their forces and the line of the River Somme further east was the only
realistic future defensive position that Model could hope to use to stop the Allied
advance, provided it was not too rapid:
