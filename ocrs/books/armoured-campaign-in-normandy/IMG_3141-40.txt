Fighting the Tank
Montgomery and his Eighth Army in North Africa heavily influenced the stand-
ardisation of the British army around the American 75mm gun in 1942. During the
first year of the North African campaign the lack of an effective HE round for the
6-pounder guns in British tanks and anti-tank guns was seen as a great handicap as
there was no effective mobile weapons for use against German anti-tank guns such
as the famous 88mm Flak gun. This weakness was solved almost overnight with the
arrival of the first Sherman M4 tanks from America in September 1942. Not only
did the British then have a superior HE gun to the standard 6-pounder weapon
with an armour-piercing capability that could penetrate all German tanks so far
encountered, but it was also mounted in a tank that was fast and mechanically reli-
able. The British had already some experience of the 75mm gun in the American
Lee/Grant tanks and the approbation from the Middle East and Montgomery was
enough to see it adopted in November 1942 as the future main armament for
British tanks! However, the provision of a tank gun with both good armour-
Penetrating ability and HE performance remained a problem that plagued the War
Office throughout the war.
Some within the Ministry of Production (oddly not the RAC) in March 1943
argued that with recent improvements in both the HE and AP ammunition for the
6-pounder, the 75mm gun was now inferior and would be inadequate to defeat
heavier German armour in the future:
It would seem therefore that by adopting the 75mm gun as the standard weapon for
the majority of the tanks, we should be gratuitously reproducing in 1943 and 1944 the
state of weapon inferiority for which we had to pay so dearly for in 1941 and 1942?
the argents by the Ministry of Production, which paps was perceived as
being only interested in rationalising its production, were not powerful enough
O persuade those that supported the 7smm main gun such as Montgomery and
P.J. Grigg, the Secretary of State for War at the War Office. With promises of a new
higher velocity 75mm and 76mm gun, the status quo was allowed to remain and
