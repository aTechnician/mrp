The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
closing the Gap was that the more mobile panzer divisions got out of the encircle-
ment, as did many infantrymen on foot. However, as many as 40,000 soldiers did
not get through, as this statement from an SS officer captured on 21 August at
St Lambert, reveals:
At 2 o'clock, we received a report that the Gap had been forced. We were to move
accordingly and drove off in three cars. We drove two or three kilometres and then
came onto roads which were completely blocked. There were four or five columns
which had run into each other with dead and wounded in between. We put our
vehicles into one column and got stuck in it. Then we were on foot from 3 o lock
in the morning until six o'clock. Eventually we arrived forward at the place where
the Gap was supposed to be and met about two or three hundred men. They were
composed of a parachute battalion to which SS and army and GAF and Navy person-
nel had attached themselves.
The tanks joined us, a Mark IV and a Panther; they
were put in the vanguard with scouts aboard and a platoon behind then the troops.
suddenly there was heavy firing into the sunken road. At first it sounded like fire
trom anti-tank guns and mortars and machine guns interspersed with rifle fire. The
tanks immediately reversed and ran over some of our men whereupon all the infantry
streamed back. I took up a position at the Car to hold up the retreat and shot the first
one who came along. An RSM stood beside me and brought them to a halt. Then
the tank drove up and I ordered it to drive forward again. Soon the tank was hit and
set on fite. We lay down flat and then some heavy firing came along the sunken road
from ahead. We had a great many dead and wounded. We lay for ten minutes and then
the fire eased off a bit. I heard the sound of tanks so I made two men came forward
with Faustpatrone which we still had with us. It slowly became light and then we saw
Americans in the opposite hedge. We fired at them with machine guns and automatic
weapons. Then the enemy started firing again. There was suddenly heavy cannon
and machine gun fire out of the whole hedge. Then someone at the rear started to
wave a white flag. We shot him at a distance of 100 metres. After a second attempt
with a white flag had also proved unsuccessful, we heard the noise of an enemy tank
ahead again. In the meantime we had brought up our second tank, the Panther. This
was given orders to take up a position behind the shot-up Mark IV and shoot up the
advancing tanks with its gun. The Panther made a mistake in not taking up a position
directly behind the Mark IV and drove past it. It was hit and burst into flames. Later
another white flag appeared and we fired at the troops surrendering. We were in the
process of trying to approach the enemy tank with the Faustpatrone when American
troops captured us.42
Tank Losses
Polish tank losses, despite the intensity of the fighting at Coudehard, were not
as heavy as in Operation Totalize. Eleven tanks were lost on Hill 262, and nine
403
Falaise Gap
Shermans and five Fireflies had been destroyed over the preceding week." Since
15 August, the loth Mounted Rifles had lost eleven Cromwells and two Ms tanks,
and seven others had been damaged.
The Canadian losses are difficult to determine exactly as no records exist for
the period. A comparison of regiment strengths at the conclusion of Operation
Iratable with the estimated strengths on 22 August gives the following losses:
• BCR one Sherman and one Ms
• GGFG two Shermans and two Ms
• CGG three Shermans
• SAR six Shermans and one Ms knocked out
Four Ves in the armoured regiments were damaged, as were another twelve
Shermans, mostly from South Albertas. There is anecdoctal evidence that the South
Albertas lost at least twenty tanks. On 21 August, the engineers of the Canadian
First Army had 157 tanks awaiting recovery or repair atter two weeks of fighting,
ninety-two of them from the three armoured brigades in the znd Canadian Corps.
Other tanks knocked out on the battlefield had not yet been discovered by recon-
naissance or reported.+
