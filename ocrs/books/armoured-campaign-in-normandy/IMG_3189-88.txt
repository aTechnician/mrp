The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
namely the capture of the bridges over the River Odon. General Roberts said, It
was thought that being tanks, they would have a greater chance of breaking out.
I never thought much of their luck if they had to make a fight of it." In view of
the German resistance, it is fortunate that no more than two tanks were lost to the
Panzerfaust-wielding engineers of the 12th SS Panzer Division.
The division's organic motorised infantry, the I59th Brigade, was not used in
the first two days of the battle and then was hurriedly moved overnight into the
bridgehead over the River Odon, only to be left there until s July, under fire but
undefeated when the division's tanks retired back across the river on the night of
29 June. The tanks and infantry clearly did not co-operate or support each other
and this problem was not confined to the lIth Armoured Division. The tanks of
the 3ist Tank Brigade had not trained with the isth (H) infantry before and their
attempts to work with each other were not very successful. On 26 June the tanks
of the 7th RTR ran into a minefield, forcing the infantry to continue the attack
without them. Radio sets in the tanks did not work, making visual signals and
direct speech the only methods of communicating with the infantry. Given the
noisiness of the tanks, which required their crews to wear headphones and the
limited visibility through the narrow vision ports of the tanks, even these forms of
communication were not reliable. In the heavy rain on the afternoon of 26 June,
the Churchill tanks had trouble seeing and communicating with each other, let
alone infantrymen outside the tanks. The result on a number of occasions was
Scotsmen being killed or wounded by machine-gun fire from the tanks.
The bocage countryside also contributed to the problems of infantry/tank co-
operation.
The terrain certainly favoured the German defenders who had time
to prepare their bunkers, determine arcs of fire and site well-concealed anti-tank
guns. The small fields and orchards lined with earthen embankments and tall
hedgerows reduced the visibility of the attackers. The sunken roads of the terrain
also made visibility of the flanks difficult for the advancing tanks and afforded
opportunities for determined panzergrenadiers to ambush any vehicles on the road.
A well-camouflaged and sited anti-tank gun could dominate a road and once the
leading tank was knocked out, it often blocked the road so the other tanks had to
move cross-country where they fell victim to other tanks or anti-tank guns. The
infantry could move through the hedgerows and woods more easily than the tanks,
which had to find gaps and open ground to make progress and these too were often
covered by anti-tank guns.
When the Germans had to attack, the roles were reversed and it was the British
soldiers who had the advantage of concealed anti-tank guns and found the German
tanks just as potentially vulnerable to their PIATs as the British tanks were to
the Panzerfäuste.
Infantry were needed by tanks to locate the hidden anti-tank guns whilst the
infantry needed the tanks to neutralise machine gun posts. The tanks needed
the infantry to keep away German snipers and infantry armed with the short
range Panzerfaust whilst the infantry needed the tanks as mobile gun platforms.
Operation Epsom
173
The British armoured divisions were beginning to learn a painful lesson. As the
i Armoured Division at Villers Bocage had found out to its cost, armoured
coumns could not go tramping about the bocage countryside as if they were on
manoeuvres in the desert. In such Normandy terrain, the tanks could not domi-
mate the battlefield, which was often reduced to the size of the field the tank found
isfin. The frontline in Operation Epsom became 'a mass of small engagements
and disconnected fighting on both sides whereby the operations of one part of the
lorce had little or no effect on the local situation of the other.? In the past, many
tank battles had been fought with only a few infantry. In much of the Normandy
campagn, it was the infantry that would come to dominate the battles and there
was an urgent need to address this in the organisation and training of the armoured
disions. The outcome of future battles would depend on how well the Allied
commanders understood and resolved this problem.
