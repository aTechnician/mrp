The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
the hedge without the front of the tank rising up and exposing the thinly armoured
underside of the tank to enemy fire. Various types of hedge cutters were devised by
different units and fixed to the front of M4 tanks to enable a tank to ram a hedge-
row and smash its way through a small section to make a gap to allow the entry of
a waiting platoon of tanks into the field. The most famous and effective device was
that devised by Sergeant Culin of the 102nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron in
the 2nd Armored Division. Hundreds of Culin's device and other designs utilising
similar metal forks and blades were hastily manufactured and welded to M4 tanks
in time for Operation Cobra.
Phase
Phase I-Dozer tanks or engineer teams gap hedgerows as indirect fire falle on
German positions. Tank and infantry teams attack along outer edges of fields,
then sweep across the objective.
Phase Il
аннї.
Phase Il-Perent companies move forward and provide suppressive fire as
friendly forces gap hedgerows of center field. Tank and infantry teams assault
German position from the flanks.

Battle of the Hedgerows
With this two-part solution of combined tank and infantry teams able to
communicate with each other and tanks that could physically break through
the hedgerows, each division found its own tactical solution to the problem
so that no common system was ever adopted by FUSA. For example, the 3rd
mored Division adopted the tactics of attacking three adjacent fields at a time
by forcing gaps in the two outer fields and then entering the fields with teams
of tanks and infantry which worked their way along the perimeter of the fields.
The centre field would then be attacked and breached simultaneously from three
different directions.
These tactics were trialled at Villies Fossard by CCA of the 3rd Armored
Dison and were not entirely successful as the tanks and armoured infantry man-
aged to get separated and bulldozers broke down. However, this was perhaps more
due to the combat inexperience of the men of CCA, which trained intensively to
perfect the tactics over the following weeks.
The and Armored Division came up with a system of tank-mounted infantry
alacking in two waves behind a first wave of only tanks. The infantry of the
second wave dismounted to deal with targets located by the first wave
and to
protect the tanks while the third wave dealt with any enemy positions missed by
the first two waves?6
The solutions devised by each armoured and infantry unit, although different,
were all potentially successful and FUSA was now ready to try and get out of the
bocage country once and for all into the open countryside south of St Lô.
