The Landings in Italy; Operation 'Baytown'
During the early stages of the assault across the Straits of Messina
and the subsequent advance,
the 5th
British and ist
Canadian
Divisions were maintained by four amphibious companies, RASC,
plying backwards and forwards across the Straits from dumps
the neighbourhood of Messina to the beaches just north of Reggio.
The dukws of 385 Company were off-loading on the beaches within
one and a half hours of H hour.
Because of the early withdrawal
of the enemy, there had been little expenditure of ammunition, and
the beach maintenance areas were rapidly stocked up.
The dukws
presented a considerable traffic problem in the narrow walled roads
just north of Reggio, and, until traffic circuits had been made and
roads widened, the congestion presented a vulnerable target to the
enemy air force.
Two troops of mules accompanied one of the leading brigades'
of
the 5th Division which advanced direct into the hills behind Reggio.
They
crossed the straits
in LCTs.
Considerable
difficulty
experienced in embarking the mules, which took a great dislike
to
the ribbed decks of the landing craft.
These mules accompanied
the 5th Division as far as the River Gargliano,
where
they had
to
be left behind when the division went to Anzio; they covered
whole
distance on
foot and although
they
often
marched
behind the rest of the division,
they managed
to
keep
up
with
average rate of advance of the division over a 1
period of five:
months.

The advance up the coast road on either side of the
was hampered by frequent obstructions,
and the
rate
advance
was only maintained by the use of dukws and landing craft,
wexe used both for ferrying troops forward and for the carriage of
maintenance stores.
