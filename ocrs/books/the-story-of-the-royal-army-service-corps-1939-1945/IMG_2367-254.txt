THE R.A.S.C, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
In our war establishments there were no 'reserve parks', those
useful horse-drawn
maids of all work of the First World
War
which, basically rolling, magazines,
formed an invaluable reserve
of horse transport for short hauls.
Now, their place was taken by
two L of C railhead MT Companies RASC, equipped with 10-ton
lorries, each with a carrying capacity equal to 14 days' hard rations
for a corps, and actually with these supplies in their possession.
During the quiescent period from September grd, 1939, to May,
1940, they provided a useful reserve of transport, and one of them
was to earn laurels for its tactical prowess during, the subsequent
withdrawal to Dunkirk,
The experience gained with these com-
panies led to the adoption of the 10-tonner, initially as a possible
transport link between Iraq and Palestine and later for general
transport purposes in the Western Desert and on other fronts.
The Vehicle Reserve Depots
On the provision side, the flow of vehicles from the Ministry of
Supply contracts was not long in getting under way,
The British
load-carrying vehicles were nearly all of the single driven axle type
during the first year of the war, but as time went on many manu-
facturers built four-wheel drive lorries, and to the ranks of these
came the Bedford lorry firm (General Motors) and the great
numbers made by this firm were of inestimable value.
It was soon
evident that the one vehicle reserve depot at Feltham could not cope
with the influx of vehicles, and an offshoot was started first of all at
Olympia, as a temporary measure until the large depot at Slough
could be established,
Even then the capacity of Slough
inadequate, and an overflow was placed in Burnham
Beeches,
There were several occasions when the Slough depot attracted the
attention of the public, particularly of passengers on the then Great
Western Railway system, which passed beside the depot,
Habitual
passengers jumped to the conclusion that the vehicles they saw there
each day were exactly the same as they had seen the previous day,
It was not lony, moreover, before this came to the notice of the
Prime Minister, who issued a peremptory order from 10, Downing
Street urging the removal of this vast quantity of transport,
Some
24 hours later it was difficult to find a single vehicle in the Slough
depot, and this clearance was renderes possible by the fact that
the new depot at Ashchurch, which had been planned in 193ß-38)
was at that time just ready to function,
This episode is mentioned
in Volume 11 of Sir Winston Churchills The Second World War,
Their Finest Hour, on page 519, Which reprints the actual instruction
verbatim.
Burnham Beeches was retained for a long, time after
this because of the excellent eves meat allorded in that location,
The Ashchurch depot had bean designed originally to hold
