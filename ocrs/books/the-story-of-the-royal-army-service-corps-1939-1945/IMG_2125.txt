HONOURS AND AWARDS RECEIVED
BY ROYAL ARMY SERVICE CORPS
OFFICERS AND MEN 1939-1945
To have published the complete list of Honours and Awards
received by Officers and other ranks of the Royal Army Service
Corps in all theatres would have taken more space than could be
spared for the purpose.
It was therefore decided to give only the total numbers in each
grade appointed to the Most Excellent Order of the Bath or to the
Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, but to publish the names
of those who were made members of the Distinguished Service Order
or awarded the Military Cross, the George Medal, the Distinguished
Conduct Medal, the Military Medal and the Distinguished Flying
Medal.
