SOUTH-EAST ASIA
atmosphere of 'business as usual' in the life of Malaya.
This
outlook is perhaps understandable.
The BEF, although landed in
France, was not engaged with the enemy, and the threatened air
offensive against Britain which most thinking people felt would
be the enemy's first move had not materialized.
The volunteer
forces in Malaya and the island were still plying their normal
civilian professions or trades.
The nearest territories were neutral
Siam,
and the Netherlands
East Indies and Indo-China which
were occupied by friendly nations.
It also even seemed as if the seriousness of the impending position
was imperfectly understood at home as, for example, the financial
powers on defence works of the GOC were limited to £500, and
any project involving more than that sum required reference to the
War Office.
No new unit could be raised locally or establishment
increased without a similar reference, and the business of obtaining
authority for action seemed to be hedged about with endless queries
and frustrating delays, factors which had an intimate effect on the
RASC, which had to rely on raising local units to create the required
transport reserve.
The story of the RASC in Malaya after the outbreak of war
should perhaps be more properly called the story of the Imperial
ASC, were it permissible
to coin such a term, as almost all the
reinforcements to join the command were drawn from India and
from Australia, their formations having their own respective comple-
ments of Royal Indian Army Service Corps and Australian Army
Service Corps (later made Royal).
But as the primary responsibility
for the supply and transport services in the command remained an
RASC one, this short account is told from that angle.
The first reinforcement, the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade Group,
was a welcome addition to the garrison.
Designed to act indepen-
dently, it was self-contained and included RIASC base and line of
communication supply units.
Army HQ in India had appointed
a DADST to administer the ST services for the force, which was
known as Force Emu, on the understanding that he would demand
direct on India for requirements.
The RIASC units in the force
differed in name and nature if not in purpose from the British
Army pattern.
There was a supply issue section for the detailed
issue of rations cattle stock section for providine and handling
meat on hoof acceptable to the various religions of the Indian
troops, and two supply depot sections for the storage of reserves and
making issue in bulk at the base and on the line of communication.
A further difference arose from the fact that the Indian formation
was to be given an active service scale of food in kind while the
normal garrison of the command continued to follow the peace
system of messing on a cash accounting basis.
