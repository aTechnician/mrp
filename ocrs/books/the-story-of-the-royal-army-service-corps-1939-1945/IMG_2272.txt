THE CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN
reverted to the original name of HQ 15 Army Group and became
an operational headquarters
only.
The
DST
(Major-General
Whitty) then dealt direct on ST matters with the DDSTs of the
two armies and the DDSTs of the districts into which the rear areas
were divided.
Both the DDSTs of the two armies were officers of
the Territorial Army, Brigadiers H. J. Gilman and S. T. Divers, and
each in turn held the appointment of DDST of both armies.
There were several changes in the high
command during the
campaign.
When General Eisenhower was
withdrawn to take
command of the forces in Europe his place was taken by General
Wilson. When he left at the end of 1944
to
another
appointment in the United States, General
Alexander became the
Supreme Allied Commander, his place at
being
filled by General Mark Clark.

The Landings in Italy; Operation 'Baytown'
During the early stages of the assault across the Straits of Messina
and the subsequent advance,
the 5th British and
Ist Canadian
Divisions were maintained by four amphibious companies,
RASC,
plying backwards and forwards across the Straits from dumps in
the neighbourhood of Messina to the beaches just north of Reggio.
The dukws of 385 Company were off-loading on the beaches within
one and a half hours of H hour.
Because of the early withdrawal
of the enemy, there had been little expenditure of ammunition,
the beach maintenance areas were rapidly stocked up.
The dukws
presented a considerable traffic problem in the narrow walled roads
just north of Reggio, and, until traffic circuits had been made and
roads widened, the congestion presented a wulnerable target to the
enemy air force.
I wo troops of mules accompanied one of the leading brigades of
the 5th Division which advanced dice onto the hills behind Reggio.
They crossed the straits in LCTs.
Considerable
difficulty
experienced in embarking the mules, which took a oreat dislike to
the ribbed decks of the landing craft.
These mules accompanied
the 5th Division as far as the River Garioliano. where they had to
be left behind when the division went to Anzio. they antoned th
whole distance on foot and although they
marched
behind the rest of the division, they managed to keep
with
the
average rate of advance of the division over a period of five months
The advance up the coast road on either
