Montgomery and "Colossal Cracks"
The extent to which the British army creamed off those Home Forces per-
sonnel considered fit for drafting overseas to boost the 21st Army Group's
strength illustrates the scale of this manpower shortage.
To be eligible for
drafting to operational formations in combat overseas, an infantryman had to be
in the Grade A1 medical category and be between 19 and 38 years old. As of 21
February 1944 there remained just 30,093 infantrymen within the active Lower
Establishment infantry divisions in Home Forces, as the army already had
transferred many such troops to Montgomery's
command
This figure,
however, excludes those infantrymen serving in the reserve or holding divisions
and other smaller miscellaneous units; yet the vast majority of these infantrymen
remained unfit for drafting. By 1 April 1944 the 21st Army Group already had
drafted 7,480 (or 25 percent) of these 30,093 apparently combat-fit infantrymen,
to bring it up to full War Establishment plus authorized reinforcerents.
However, a significant number of the infantrymen within Home Forces were not
fit for infantry duties in the field, on age and/or medical grounds.
Home Forces
calculated that some 20-25 percent of its infantrymen (that is, between 6,019
and 7,523 soldiers) remained unfit for drafting to the 21st Army Group29
Hence, some nine weeks before it even set foot in France, Montgomery's
command had absorbed between 31 and 33 percent (7,480 out of between
22,570 and 24,074) of Home Forces' available draft-quality infantry strength. In
addition, Home Forces dispatched 5,272 troops from branches other than the
infantry to the 21st Army Group in the same period. Thus, in the weeks prior
to D-Day, the 21st Army Group also experienced manpower shortages in
branches other than the infantry, especially within the Royal Armored Corps
[RAC]; a shortage that was to persist throughout the Normandy battles."
The War Office also planned in advance that Home Forces would give up
13,000 infantrymen during June and July 1944 as reinforcements to replace
casualties incurred by the 21st Army Group in Normandy. In spring 1944,
prolonged staff planning investigated the difficult question of how Home Forces
could provide these drafts yet simultaneously fulfill its own burdensome tasks.
Reduced by early June 1944 to a paltry 22,000 rifle infantry (of which only
14,200 were fit for drafting), the Lower Establishment divisions fielded by
Home Forces still had to defend the United Kingdom, undertake marshaling
duties for "Overlord," and most importantly both train new recruits and retrain
wounded soldiers returned from combat. These commitments absorbed large
amounts of manpower: The defense of the Orkneys and Shetlands alone
accounted for 13,000 personnel, while "Overlord" marshaling duties required
17,961 personnel at its peak in early June 1944, before tapering off by August."
Clearly, by D-Day, Home Forces was stretched to the breaking point to fulfill its
existing commitments, let alone to meet the demand for the dispatch of 13,000
infantrymen to the 21st Army Group during June and July 1944.
The dispatch of these 13,000 infantry soldiers to Montgomery during the
first seven weeks of the Normandy campaign meant that by 7 August 1944,
Home Forces' Lower Establishment Divisions now fielded just 8,032 rifle
infantrymen, of which staggeringly a mere 2,654 were draft-quality!33

Strategic Reserve, the British army could only muster immediately a pool of
under 2,700 available combat-ready infantry within the entire United King-
dom —while simultaneously in Normandy,
Montgomery conducted the most
important British army campaign of the entire war! The British High Command
dispatched most of the remaining 2,700 draft-quality infantrymen deployed in
the Lower Establishment Divisions to Montgomery during the rest of August
1944.
Consequently, by the autumn, the 21st Army Group had absorbed
virtually all the fit young infantrymen the United Kingdom could offer: By then
Home Forces had been reduced to a force consisting of young lads, old men,
and the unfit.
Given that Montgomery's command had bled Home Forces dry of draftable
riflemen by September 1944, from this time on those new British army infantry
recruits who each month had completed their standard training represented the
only future source of infantry reinforcements for the 21st Army Group —unless
the High Command took the drastic step of withdrawing field forces from other
theaters for disbandment. Short of this desperate measure, the War Office also
could supplement this paltry monthly infantry manpower output both with
recovered wounded who had completed refresher training, and with troops from
other branches who had completed their retraining as infantry.
This evidence casts the gravest doubts on D'Este's conclusions at the end of
his analysis of manpower.
Here, he produces new evidence, contradicting his
earlier argument, that he believes "casts serious doubt on the legitimacy of the
infantry reinforcement shortage. "34
Citing War Office documentation, D'Este
observes that on 30 June 1944 there were no fewer than 6,373 infantry officers
and 109,251 infantry other ranks deployed within the United Kingdom in
addition to those forces allocated to the 21st Army Group.35
D'Este, despite
admitting that some of these troops were needed to defend the British isles, and
that others were either involved in the training process or earmarked as future
reinforcements for France, nevertheless concluded that the "availability of vast
numbers of uncommitted infantry [sic] poses several disturbing questions."
D'Este then pondered "why were none of these troops used in Normandy" and
"why were United Kingdom-based infantry units not disbanded instead of line
infantry units of the Second [(British)] Army?"
In answer to this question,
D'Este mused "were they deliberately withheld" by Churchill because he either
"so mistrust[ed] the eventual success of Overlord" that he remained "simply
unwilling to commit them to Montgomery," or because he wished to "place
limitations on the numbers of men he was willing to sacrifice at this stage of the
Second World War? " 36
Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth; there simply were not
"vast numbers of uncommitted infantry" still in the United Kingdom on 30 June
1944.
On paper there remained over 100,000 infantry within the United
Kingdom outside those in the 21st Army Group. The simple truth is that only a
tiny fraction of these forces were fit for active combat duties in France; Home
Forces, as his study already has demonstrated, had been virtually bled dry of
draftable infantry by August 1944.
Of these 100,000 infantry, there were, as
D'Este rightly concedes, no less than 52,916 other ranks in training, depot, and
