Conclusions
This work has analyzed systematically the operational methods used by the 21st
Army Group in the 1944 45 Northwest Europe campaign, methods encapsu-
lated by Montgomery's term "Colossal Cracks." The technique utilized by
Montgomery and the 21st Army Group involved large set-piece battles based on
concentration of force, massed artillery firepower (supplemented by strategic
aerial bombing when possible), and integrated use of tactical air power.
The
army group only commenced these set-piece battles after careful preparation
and massive concentration of resources, and then conducted these operations
cautiously and methodically, with great regard to the logistical situation.
"Colossal Cracks" constituted an attritional method based on copious matériel,
particularly massed artillery firepower.
This technique eschewed operational
maneuver —at least until the combat power of the Westheer had been seriously
denuded; once this point had been reached, the Allies would utilize their
superior mobility -engendered by their dominance of the skies -to conduct
successful mobile operations that would secure ultimate victory.
This analysis has demonstrated that Montgomery and his army command-
ers -Crerar and Dempsey -conducted this campaign in a highly competent
manner.
Montgomery's generalship in this campaign —that is, his handling of
the ZIst Army
Group-remained more effective than some historians have
previously recognized.
The hypothesis that underpins and justifies this reas-
sessment of the manner in which the 21st Army Group conducted this campaign
is that although historians to date have produced good partial examinations of
the methods used by this formation, they have not produced an entirely satis-
factory
comprehensive
analysis of all the
characteristics
comprising the
"Colossal Cracks"
approach.
Such a systematic examination is necessary
because the individual aspects of this approach are all interrelated. The validity
of some of the criticism of Montgomery made by historians remains limited
because these criticisms only relate to individual aspects of his operational
