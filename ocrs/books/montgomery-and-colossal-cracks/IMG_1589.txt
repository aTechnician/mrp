Montgomery and "Colossal Cracks"
July; third "an operation by 8 Corps east of the Orne" to help the Canadian
Corps capture the woods around Garcelles on 30 July; and finally, after these
"preliminary" actions, "a very large scale operation toward Falaise," ultimately
code-named "Totalize."137
Though Montgomery utilized this approach most frequently in Normandy,
he still employed it later in the campaign. One example of this was the twin
Operation "Nutcracker/Mallard" launched on 14 November 1944, which was
followed four days later by Operation "Clipper;" Montgomery only launched the
latter after these twin attacks had commenced and thus had attracted most of the
German reserves. In "Clipper" the XXX Corps made a thrust through Geilen-
kirchen toward Linnich on the River Roer to protect the northern flank of the
U.S. Ninth Army in its drive on Cologne !38*
In this post-Normandy period
Montgomery also used this alternate thrust approach in a modified form -a pair
of converging attacks, one proceeding the other.
One example of this was
Operation "Constellation," O Connor's October 1944 thrust to clear the Venlo
salient. Operation "Veritable" also followed this characteristic, if only by force
of circumstances rather than by design. Originally, Montgomery conceived the
operation as the northern half of a great pincer movement aimed at Wesel on the
Rhine, with the American Operation "Grenade" forming the southern half of this
pincer with an advance northeast from the Roemmond-filice south However, the
enemy's deliberate flooding of the River Roer delayed the American thrust.
Nevertheless Montgomery decided to push ahead alone, even though he realized
that in doing so he would incur additional casualties as his forces would attract
all the German reserves; at the same time this would facilitate the subsequent
advance of "Grenade."
Montgomery's alternate thrusts policy was an appropriate approach given the
strengths of the Allies and the weaknesses of the Germans.
His utilization of
this approach sought to catch the Germans off balance, so as to reduce the
potential resistance Anglo-Canadian attacks would meet.
This technique also
wore down the battle-worthiness of the key elements in the German defense, the
panzer units used as mobile fire-brigades.
The 21st Army Group could switch
formations and units from one flank to the other easier than the Germans, since
the latter's mobility had been emasculated by the overwhelming power of Allied
total air superiority.
The distinction between the set-piece battle approach and the alternate
thrusts technique should not be overemphasized, nor should the existence of two
approaches be seen as inconsistency on Montgomery's part.!39
Though these
approaches were different, they were not stark alternatives but rather comple-
mentary styles. For the operations enacted in the alternate thrusts technique
were smaller-scale set-piece battles.
Moreover, alternate thrusts used the
smaller initial operations as preliminaries to pave the way for a successful,
massive, set-piece "Colossal Crack" by forcing the enemy into becoming
unbalanced.
The preceding analysis has examined the foundations of Montgomery's
operational approach, the set-piece "Colossal Crack" battle. His approach was
based on the characteristics of the master plan, concentration, firepower-based

attrition, and caution.
He used the set-piece battle in conjunction with his
operational policy of alternate thrusts. Though these five characteristics were
the fundamental components of Montgomery's operational approach in North-
west Europe, his overall technique comprised other important aspects that have
still to be examined. It is to these other facets of Montgomery's operational
approach that this analysis now turns.
