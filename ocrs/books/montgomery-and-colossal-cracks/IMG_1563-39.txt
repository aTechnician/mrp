Montgomery's Normandy campaign represented the British army's main
effort during 1944.
On 30 March 1944 the British army estimated that it
required 102,250 infantry reinforcements to replace wastage across all war
theaters during the nine-month period April to December 1944, at an average
rate of 11,361 infantrymen per month. The army expected the 21st Army Group
to incur 61,255 infantry casualties (as per the "medium" definition) during the
first six months of the campaign, at an average rate of 10,209 infantrymen per
monin.
Montgomery's army group required 90 percent of the British army's
entire infantry reinforcement demands during the second half of 1944 just to
prevent its infantry combat strength shrinking:
The seriousness of the future manpower shortage was abundantly clear to the
British High Command.
Grigg's 25 March 1944 Minute concluded that if
"Overlord" incurred casualties at the estimated rates, the British army would "be
worse off by about 30,000 men than we had previously anticipated." Even with
the Lower Establishment Divisions broken up for drafting, "our total deficiency"
in the field "will be in the order of 60,000, of which 40,000 will be infantry."?:
Similarly, at the 30 May 1944 Cabinet Meeting on manpower, Weeks concluded
that, after replacement of estimated casualties, the British army as a whole
"would be 100,000 men down by the end of the year" in comparison with
December 1943.24
In response to these fears, Grigg urged that the army expand the process of
combing out rear establishments that it had commenced in early 1944. He also
calculated that the army would have to disband one operational division in both
the Italian and Normandy theaters to provide reinforcements for other field
divisions.
From October 1944 onwards, Grigg concluded, "at best we can hope
that the larger intakes which we are due to get into the army from March [1944]
onwards, augmented by returning wounded and [men] retraining from other
arms as infantry might stabilize the situation and prevent a further weakening of
effort."
However, the reinforcements earmarked for 1945 were, he reported,
inadequate.25
• In an attempt to minimize this manpower problem, on 30 March
1944 the Cabinet authorized the transfer of 35,000 men from the artillery and
the R.A.F. Regiment for retraining as infantry.26
Yet it would be many months
before these men would complete their retraining and be ready for combat in
France
Implementation of these measures would leave, by August 1944, just one
operational formation in the entire United Kingdom; this illustrates the extent to
which this situation compelled the War Office to scrape the bottom of the
manpower barrel.
lhe sole operational formation located in the Unitec
Kingdom, the mountain-trained 52nd Infantry Division, had been held in the
War Office Strategic Reserve since being earmarked at Chiefs of Staff level for
Operation "Jupiter," the proposed invasion of Norway.?7
By August the British
army entrusted the defense of the United Kingdom to just three reserve and one
holding divisions, plus two cadre Lower Establishment divisions for retraining
returning wounded; none of these formations was in any way fit for operational
commitment abroad.
