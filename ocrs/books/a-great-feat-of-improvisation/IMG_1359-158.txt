A Great Feat of Improvisation
early October for winter items and although stocks were dispatched from UK, a perfect storm
started to brew with withdrawals of summer clothing which needed to laundered and stored,
clashing with receipts and issues of winter clothing.
These initial shortages were so acute that
some soldiers, even in regular divisions, deployed wearing the 1922 Pattern Service Dress.9
The effective prosecution of these tasks was complicated by insufficient suitable storage and no
time to generate a sustainable issue plan, a scenario exacerbated by the failure to provision a
BEF military laundry capability when it deployed to France, the necessary equipment being
awaited from production. Hastily arranged local contracts were therefore, the only solution,"
although the Royal Engineers were capable of constructing a suitable facility and installing the
equipment and supporting utilities."
From an organizational perspective, the most prolific users of the service were the Dieppe
Medical Base Sub-Area (MBSA) and the general hospitals, although the Returned Stores Depot,
which handled considerable quantities of clothing, also required support. With little available
commercial capability accessible in the Main Base Areas and the transport arrangements
adding to turn-round times, a laundry in Rouen was contracted to support the MBSA, washing
200,000 pieces weekly. Another laundry in Le Harve delivered a similar output, whilst smaller
laundries were either contracted or staffed with RAOC personnel.? In early January 1940,
the GHQ Ordnance Directorate began planning for the seasonal withdrawal of approximately
1.6 million items of winter clothing including woollen underwear, leather jerkins, greatcoats,
sheepskin-coats, third blankets and Boots, Rubber (Knee & Thigh), all of which required
cleaning and maintenance in preparation for storage and future reissue.? Selected to undertake
this task was the largest of the dry cleaning companies in Paris, Blanchisseries et Teintureries de
France located at Boulogne - Billancourt, a suburb of Western Paris and equipped with modern
plant." Clothing arrived by rail at a siding adjacent to the works, and although the commercial!
company undertook all the dis-infection, cleaning and repair operations, which was extended to
web equipment, a RAOC Laundry Detachment of 26 was responsible for conducting checks on
standards and controlling all receipts and issues at the railhead. When the enemy occupation
of Paris became imminent, all the stocks of clothing and equipment were rendered unusbe dy

Another key improvement to morale as well as being essential to health and hygiene and thus
grational capability, was access to effective bathing facilities. In this respect, the provision
r sometimes otherwise of this amenity, is a microcosm of the differentials between the logistic
apolitie in the corps areas and those in the Base and the role of support in sustaining the
oldier. Whilst even at corps level it had taken until March 1940 for I Corps to receive and
