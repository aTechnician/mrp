The W4 Plan directed that a reserve of 45 x Daily Ammunition Expenditure Rate (DAER)
should be held In-Theatre.
Two BADs were to be established, each of three ASDs holding
7,000 tons apiece, thus totalling 21,000 tons per BAD, but from the start of the deployment it
was clear that as the BEF expanded more storage would be required"! The decision of the War
91 A key driver of the increasing need for expanding the ammunition storage capability in France was the
growing numbers of artillery
units in the BEF, which for May 1940 is summarized in the table belon.

die bud have shouldered the burden in the Home Base but apart from the convenience
wing the work elsewhere, it is possible that the War Office identified the irritating
bity of resistance from within the rural shires and from the Ministry of Agriculture, to
struction of et more ammunition storage facilities in the UK. No doubt the War Office
cert hate French would be more amenable to the requirement, whilst the continuous
lad of munitions to the Continent firmly demonstrated to Friend and Foe alike, Britain's
