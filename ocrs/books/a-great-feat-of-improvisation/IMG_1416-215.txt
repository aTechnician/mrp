sore them. The depot had only opened in March 1940, construction work was ongoing,
to there were a raft of problems relating to procedures and security, few of which had been
moled. In adition, the storage of gas weapons in an underground facility required especial
i, particularly with regard to ventilation and checks for leakers' 115 These matters were the
niet of much discussion by the depot staff because Harpur Hill was not designed or equipped
handle SW; indeed, it was not until May 1941 that the E Group, which was established to
ntrol th storage of such weapons, was fully functioning.
A consignment of 72 rail wagons arrived from the port of Fowey courtesy of the GWR
N LMS Railway, on 26 May 1940, causing considerable consternation because there was no
vene documentation or packing lists.l16 Members of the depot staff were thus unable to
nue a storage plan until they had examined each wagon to confirm its load, a task, which
ok 24 hours to complete. The tally was: 1,081 × 30 1b Mk I bombs, 469 * 500 lb SCI and
5: 30 SC. There was problem handling the 500 1b SCIs because the filled weapon in
scrate weighed curt 118 To provide a solution hand lift trucks were borrowed from tMe
Kode whore the SCis were filled, whilst 42 Group authorized the purchase of trucks from
the manufacturer, so the HIMF equipment could be returned. The RAF's SW were though,

BAD; the clearance had been completed with little time to spare!!! The decision to remove
the BEF's SW capability from Theatre was driven by the political and military consequences
arising from their capture. Such considerations far outweished the possibility that it might be
necessary to reply in kind and the recovery became a priority activity.
Recovery and Reconstitution
The RAF'S SW were shipped to Fowey in Cornwall from where they were transferred by rail
to Harpur Hill, two miles South of Buxton in Derbyshire, one of the RAF's main reserve
ammunition depots controlled by 28 Maintenance Unit (MUt? which was part of 42
