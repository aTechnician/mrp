A Great Feat of Improvisation
1940 to advise on the supply of specialist stores.20 None of the proposed facilities were built,
the German offensive ending the development of the site, although there was an interim plan to
use existing accommodation at Bonnieres-sur-Seine to house a small ordnance depot for AFV
Spares and stores 21
More transient logistic planning and execution involved the movement
of 1st Cavalry Division in late December 1939 and January 1940 from the UK to Palestine
via Dover by sea and rail to Marseilles, and the withdrawal in April 1940 of 5th Division
from its corps area to the Advanced Base at Le Harve in preparation for recovery to the UK
as War Office Reserve and the dispatch via UK, of its 15th Infantry Brigade for operations in
Scandinavia 23 Other smaller but nonetheless necessary moves, included the 1st Welsh Guards
from Gibraltar via Marseilles to La Hutte24 and in April 1940, 5th Scots Guards from UK via
Le Harve to Chamonix for 'special training with the French? 25
The logistic tasks continued to expand throughout the period, creating a concomitant need
for military and civilian labour not all of which could be resourced. The Royal Engineers in
particular began, increasingly, to utilize plant to improve productivity, although sometimes the
ground conditions were not conducive to their employment, CRE 2nd Division noting that
on one major project, 'There are 20 men and 20 colossal machines, 26 most of which get stuck
in the mud' 27 The RE formed a specialist unit, 135 Excavator Company?® to utilize much of
the heavy plant such as bulldozers, scrapers, draglines and drag-shovels, with new equipment
arriving ex-factory, from UK and the USA, in France via the Harwich - Calais Train Ferry?"
Interestingly, the company was recruited from All Arms because technical skills and experience
were more important than cap-badge and the first OC, Major S A Westrop, ° was a TA infantry
officer, whose professional civil engineering knowledge was fundamental to the effective use of
the equipment. Many engineer resources were also allocated to the building and expansion of
