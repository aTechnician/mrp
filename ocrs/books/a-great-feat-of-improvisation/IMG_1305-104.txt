dumps in advance of the PRHs.
In addition, 432,740 gallons 22 were to be stocked at the
advanced petrol dump at Vignacourt, 23 which was sited in the area of the Air Components
rear aerodromes.
Planning for the AASF was equally comprehensive, although as with the
Air Component, the dumps allocated to the management of the ASPs over-faced the Supply di
Transport sections because they were not provided with the necessary labour or WMT.™ By
early May, the planned holdings in the three ASPs supporting the AASF was a total of 483,000
gallons of packed fuel125 and 11,350 gallons of DTD 109 oil. When the Air Stores Parks were
ordered to move during the campaign, although some of the POL had been issued, the shortage
of WMT only enabled the evacuation of the 100 octane with much of the DTD 230 and DTD
109 being handed over to the Host Nation authorities. 126
The withdrawal created the need
for yet more aviation fuel to be dumped in new areas including 200,000 gallons to support
operations from the South Champagne airfields, and for Operation HADDOCK, 27 90,000
gallons of DTD 230 and 4,500 gallons of DTD 109 at Le Vallon and Salon-de-Provence in
Southern France near Marseilles to support the two Wellington bomber squadrons 28 tasked to
attack targets in Northern Italy, 129
Conclusion
The concept of relying upon a simple fuel distribution system utilizing a cheap disposable in,
General Service WMT capability and manual labour was under-pinned by what appeared
to be sound financial, technical and operational considerations.
The fragility of the system
however, was quickly exposed by the decision to rely on low capital investment in equipment
and processes, which delivered a tin which, whilst the foundation of the output, was not fit
for purpose.
This in turn, resulted in a whole series of complications, including serious safety
issues, loss of shipping, fuel leakage and contamination and a reduction in deliveries. The
reliance upon manual labour in the supply chain, whilst saving capital investment in equipment.
maintenance and training created pinch points at trans-shipment and cross-loading points
The BEF logisticians were however, quick to identify the inherent fragilities in the system and
sought to create robust solutions, reaching out to UK industry and the French military in the
search for effective options.
The speed at which a returnable can capability, albeit small, was
instituted through a French contract, lucidly proves that the military petrol supply experts,

Logistics chain, a pre-condition that required a cultural change in the BEF, the soldiers of

The generation and improvisation of bulk storage and transportation capabilities drawing upon
industrial technical expertise was impressive, although creating the robust military structures
to make them fully effective during manoeuvre operations was a challenge of a different order.
The forward dumping of stocks, whilst in direct conflict with doctrinal purity and introducing
in some cases unmanageable burdens to the CPP and DPC fraternities, provided the vital fuel
to keep the BEF mobile during the retreat to Dunkerque. Stock turnover became a growing
problem as reserves expanded, with fuel, especially aviation spirit, 'aging out', a problem
exacerbated by the dispatch of new fuel from the UK direct from ports in France to forward
dumps. At the tactical level, the tin and the can had much to commend them but as operations
in France were to reinforce, the effective and efficient supply of liquid fuel to an Army reliant on
the internal combustion engine required to be militarily robust as well as technically competent,
whilst the numbers of tins required to fill an aircrafti firmly suggested that the widespread
introduction of a mechanized solution was urgently required.
