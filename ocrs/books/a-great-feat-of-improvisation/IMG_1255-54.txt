of the accident, such incidents not only diverted time and resources from the main effort bur
also reduced logistic capability.
British soldiers were not however, the only casualties of such
accidents.
The commander of the First French Army Group, General Gaston-Henri Billotte,
was seriously injured on 21 May, when his driver crashed into a lorry at night. He remained ina
coma for two days before dying on 23 May, the RTA causing even more disruption to the Allied
command arrangements.120
The rapid introduction of WMT across the expanding Army had a deleterious effect upon
equipment care standards and the severe winter of 1939-1940 posed substantial challenges i
this regard, a point recognized by the Worcestershire Yeomanry, a TA anti-tank regiment.
equipped with the 2-pounder, as it prepared to embark for France:
However much the Regiment had improved in gunnery, in its maintenance of vehicles
it was woefully weak; there was still a great lack of experienced drivers and the hard
winter was soon to spotlight these deficiencies. During the night of January 2/3, two
of every three vehicles to be used by the Road Party the next day, had to be started up
every hour; despite these precautions many of them had to be taken in tow when the
party set off at seven in the morning for Southampton. 121
This issue was clearly recognized by GHQ BEF and corps MT Maintenance Schools wet

Lieutenant-General Alan Brooke, 22 although the cultural and technical infuence of thin
training took time to produce effect, an issue exacerbated by the cold meteorological conditions.
The procedures for frost-precautions for vehicles without anti-freeze in the coolant systems
whilst not complex, were certainly onerous to conduct in the cold and the dark, 23 a point
firmly made to the chain of command by numerous logistic commanders including 4 Division
CRASCI2 and OC 1 LOC Railhead Company 25 The widespread introduction of anti-frece
additives therefore improved not only soldier' morale but also operational capability, although
the logistic system was slow to distribute the relevant quantities in a timely manner, even to
divisional units 126 Even when anti freeze was available the sunri in of driver maintenance
was key to ensure procedures were correctly conducted, the failure of which could have serious

whilst during one February 1940 night, a Royal Artillery unit suffered 13 cracked engine blocks

The withdrawal from France focused the minds of the logistic planners in a whole series
of areas and one of their major concerns was the regeneration of a task vehicle fleet.
and foremost, was the requirement to make good the considerable losses, which amounted to
84,427 vehicles of all types, of which 52,859 were load-carriers in the 15-cwt to 10-ton range.!38
The Wehrmacht benefited from the British WMT abandoned in France. 6,500 vehicles were
recovered just from the Dunkerque area, of which 4,500 were salved and placed into service,
deploying across Continental Europe and the Soviet Union during the war!29 The estimated
