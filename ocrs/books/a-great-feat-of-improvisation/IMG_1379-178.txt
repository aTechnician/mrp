326 A Great Feat of Improvisation
the key features of the BEF's railway component was the reliance on the early mobilization of
the SR units, which until January 1940, provided 86 percent of the operating and construction
capacity and 100 percent of the railway stores and workshop output. Brigadier D J McMullen,
Director-General Transportation (DGT) in GHQ BEF, assisted by two deputies and their
supporting Staffs was responsible for directing and managing British military railway resources
in France. The efficiency of the British contribution was enhanced because the BEF's railway
component was controlled through one Corps, the Royal Engineers, which was responsible for
infrastructure construction and repair, railway operating and signalling, and locomotive and
rolling stock maintenance. This level of integration, which was reinforced by the experience of
the Great War on the Western Front, replicated commercial practice, although with generally
greater corporate interactions across the departments but also created synergies across the
logistic chain, which would have been impossible to generate through other arrangements.
During the deployment, the focus was solely upon the enhancement and utilization of the
SGR system, although there were suggestions, based upon the experience of the Great War,
that within depots, Narrow Gauge Railways (NGR) using 60 cm gauge Decauville rail system
should be constructed to move material. The lead Deputy-Director Transportation, Colonel
Woodhouse, wrote a cogent response to these proposals, explaining that the introduction
of NGR would increase double-handling of stocks, divert labour from SGR projects, create
more competition for shipping space, introduce yet more motive power equipment types to
the Theatre with a concomitant requirement for spares and repairs and generate the need to
skilled operatives to operate the systems.1° On balance he was, 'Generally speaking,... averse
to the proposal...' but was gracious enough to comment that the views of his fellow Deputy
Director, Colonel Waghorn might 'perhaps point to a different conclusion."' A large amount
of NGR equipment is recorded as having arrived on aboard the SS Melrose Abbey on 20 January
1940 but none of the Railway Construction Company (RCC) war diaries make reference to its
disposal, 2 although some of the assets were used to support the construction of fortifications
and aerodromes,' reinforced by assets from French contractors, many of which acquired the
materiel from BEF disposal sales after the Great War.
