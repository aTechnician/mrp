A Great Feat of Improvisation
autumn of 1940, of this simple weapon soon replaced the losses.28 Ammunition and projectors
were supplied to the CW companies through the GHQ Company RASC. The two echelons
of the RASC company carried one refill of 270 drums and 20 spare projectors for each CW
company. When a CW company was detached from GHQ Troops, an element of the GHQ
RASC Company was attached to the relevant formation RASC company, which at divisional
level was the DAC.
Ground Delivered Defensive Special Weapons
In addition to the offensive capability provided by the Livens Projector, the CW companies
also had the task of deploying SW in defence. All three of the systems, the BCV, the chemical
mine and the ground contamination bomb, were, because of production problems, not brought
into service until after the BEF was evacuated from France but plans were developed to store
and maintain them in France.29
The BCV30 was based on a Morris CS 8 truck chassis of 15
cwt, upon which was mounted a de-mountable 140 gallon water cart, capable of containing
126 gallons of liquid HT Mustard.3 Un-armoured, it was vulnerable to small arms fire and
artillery, which limited its deployment during a withdrawal in contact. There was also a plan to
issue the carts on trailers, to be drawn by a tank or Universal Carrier, and thereby offer a small
measure of protection to the laying crew. BCVs were not a permanent CW company asset and
were held centrally, being issued as required, on a scale of 50 per company.
240 were allocated
for deployment to France and GHQ intended that 120 would be held in BADs and 120 at
Ammunition Railheads (ARH). CW companies were tasked with collecting BCVs from the
ARH but given their many tasks it is probable that the DACs would have been responsible for
positioning these vehicles in the operational area, although the providing the additional drivers
would no doubt have been a challenge. The refilling procedures for the BCVs, whilst clearly a
requirement, does not appear in the documents but it is likely that the GHQ Staff planned to
return the empty equipment to the UK, although refilling by the French could have been an
