A Great Feat of Improvisation
units, some based on enlarged platoons, such as Don Details, Cobbet's Force, Cook's Light
Tanks and Woodforce, 164 was a demanding, if not occasionally hopeless, activity.
War Stocks had to be issued to improvised formations including Beauman Division 65 but
materiel shortages led to many of the units being improperly equipped. For example, 'A' Field
Regiment Royal Artillery consisting of four batteries, was planned to be equipped with 48 × 25
pounders but the ordnance depot could only issue 24 x 25 pounders, 4 x 18/25 pounders and
2 x 4.5-inch howitzers, which created logistic challenges in supply of the ammunition and the
provision of spares 66 Reserve stocks for the BEF continued to be ring-fenced held in case the
GLOC was reopened and the order to release this materiel for other purposes was not issued until
29 May, three days after the declaration of evacuation through Dunkerque was promulgated.
The Base depots also had to maintain support to the recently deployed 1st Armoured Division
and the withdrawing 51st (Highland) Division, as well as receiving materiel from the UK to
enhance the operational capability of these formations, with the distribution of AFV spares
being an especially important aspect. The transport of POL was a problem although supplies
were ample; on 4 June stocks amounted to 100,000 tons with a daily consumption of only 650,167
sufficient to last 153 days.
Events moved quickly for the logistic Staffs at every level of command. Evacuation of
stocks to the UK increased after 24 May, when the War Office ordered an urgent return of
50,000 rifles,68 50,000 respirators and 12,500 tonnes of ammunition. 169
The inference that
all British forces were to leave France was however, soon changed by the War Office. Once it
was clear that the BEF in the North would have to withdraw to the UK, plans were drafted
for the establishment of a 2nd BEF to the South of the Somme, comprising sufficient forces
for the creation of initially one, expanding to two corps, based on the following divisions: Ist
Armoured, 51st (Highland), 52nd (Lowland), Beauman and Ist (Canadian); additionally there
was also a proposal to re-constitute 3rd Division recently returned from Dunkerque. Churchill,
who wished to continue Britain's Continental commitment in order to keep the French in the
fight and Britain in Europe, drove this military concept hard. On the face of it, based on the
assumption that French forces could still offer cohesive resistance, the proposal made sound
political and military sense because whilst France was in the war, the Germans were unlikely
to attack Britain. The tempo of operations however, rendered the plan impractical, since by the
second week in June, the Ist Armoured Division was no longer combat effective, whilst 5lst
164 Woodforce was formed to defend GHQ at Hazebrouck and consisted of 3 x 25 pdrs, 1 x 25 mm
anti-tank gun, 300 men from GH and a Welsh Guards platoon armed with 11 x anti-tank rifles, 3
x Vickers MMG, 13 x LMG and 300 rifles, plus a Belgian detachment manning 12 x MG and from

168 The recovery of these rifles
Minis to the attention of the Prime-Minister, Winston Churchill, who was
advised, incorrectly, by the Ministry of Supply that there had been significant losses from Base depots.
It would appear that the 50,000 were received in the UK from the BET BODs in the period 15-24 June
1940, with further consignments totaling 45,848, being received later. Initially, losses were assessed to
be 24,557, revised downwards to 6,152.

Worst Job of the Lot 461
Highland) Division, less 154th Brigade, had in less than two days between 8-10 June been cut
offrom its withdrawal route to Le Harve or Rouen and could no longer be supplied through
the GLOC, even by road. 170
So quickly did the British operational scenario deteriorate that in
the same period the option of supporting 51st Division by sea through Dieppe or Fecamp had
lo evaporated,"' leaving evacuation through the small port of Saint Valery-en-Caux and the
adjoining beaches as the only alternative.
From the logistic perspective, the last hours of the
Highland Division's battle on 12 June were summarized by the experience of 1st Black Watch:
for some hours there had been no food or water; by noon there was no ammunition? !72
AnAppalling Traffic Jam
The re-deployment continued apace, despite the German advance and crumbling French
cistance, creating many difficulties for the logisticians. On the one hand, they were attempting
recover stocks to the UK under Operation AERIAL but on the other, generate support
incoming forces including 52nd (Lowland) Division!73 and the first brigade group of 1st
Linadian Division; it was a confusing situation, which created conflicts of priority and left
voidinate commanders to decide the main effort. The military element of the plan would have
en much more meaningful had the mission been to recover the enormous stocks from the Base
ra, though this would have created serious political repercussions. One forgotten aspect was
he te withdrawal of the logistic elements of Force W from the Saar. Whilst 51st (Highland)
sion was withdrawing to the coast, most of the logisticians supporting Force W were tasked
it covering the stocks located in the Woippy area near Metz. 22 AT Company RIASC,
