A Great Feat of Improvisation
modern strategy and tactics'4 Whether he was referring to his personal experience or the
generic issue is impossible to define from the documents but his point was exceptionally well
made. Logistics do not swim alone in the military pond and it was critical to military success in
manoeuvre warfare that the logistic commander clearly comprehended the requirements of the
combat forces and be capable of managing the resources in a dynamic operational environment.
Losses of materiel were substantial, the quantities perhaps only being occasionally exceeded
by the amount of effort devoted to investigating the detail of the figures, an issue which
remerged post-war, when research was on-going for Winston Churchill's volume Their Finest
Hour. 2 The outfall of this work exposed the dissonance within the archival figures, the loss
of wartime corporate memory and the location of pertinent documents. A War Office letter
dated 18 September 1948 from Brigadier Harry Latham to F W Deakin, researching on behalf
of Churchill, noted that, 'No figures were compiled by the War Office at the time, at any rate
none can be found now? 43
A particular point, and one that unmistakeably exposed the loss
of corporate coherence was the loss of 90,000 rifles, which the War Office Ordnance Branch
believed to be a 'pretty good guess', although in 1940, after an investigation at the behest of
the Prime-Minster, losses were initially assessed to be 24,557, revised downwards to 6,152,44
whilst another document states a loss of 180,000.45 The inability to locate documents is lucidly
illustrated by Brigadier Latham having to generate figures for artillery losses, including anti-
tank guns, calculated from the BEF ORBAT, when the War Office had compiled working
statistics in June 1940.46
