A Great Feat of Improvisation
Whilst ground action became an increasing feature of forward logistic units, air attack was
a constant threat throughout the area of operations. Five RASC soldiers and several civilians
were killed in the bombing of Moulle on 21 May.'7
Personnel from 2 OFP located in the
neighbouring village of Houllel were deployed to clear the crossroads in the centre of the
village, the unit war diary recording that: "This area had been very badly hit, and the road
was blocked with burning vehicles and dead and wounded refugees? Such scenes must have
weighed heavily upon the minds of the technical RAOC logisticians tasked with dealing with
the aftermath but the pressures of war directed that 2 OFP complete its immediate task in
order to deploy to Wylder. 20 Morale in both units would certainly not have been improved by
the knowledge that the disruption to the GLOC and AA actions against constant Luftwaffe
attacks? had created a particular shortage of AA ammunition,? with 1 AA Brigade Company
RASC struggling to find supplies to replenish the regiments protecting the three corps of the

Dead at the Wheel
Whilst the search for AA rounds continued, the RASC was even more engaged in provision
of artillery ammunition, the expenditure of which, reached prodigious proportions on some
occasions and is a very clear indication of the ferocious combat in which the BEF was engaged, 3
with on one day, consumption being 12,852 tonnes, the equivalent of 33 ammunition trains.?
As an example, the artillery fire-plan to support the withdrawal of the three brigades of 2nd
Division to the River Lasne on the evening of 15 May 1940 consumed in 4½ hours, 10,250

to which these five soldiers belonged, whilst the contemporary record may not accurately reflect the
casualties. The CWGC records no burial in local cemeteries and the soldiers must presumably be
