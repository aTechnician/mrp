A Great Feat of Improvisation
take.?º The departure stations and destinations of DYNAMO trains is a clear indication of the
traffic flows from the SEP, with Dover Marine" being the main SPOD, then Ramsgate and
Folkestone Harbour, although Harwich, Newhaven and Sheerness were also used.? Banbury
was the Rail Regulating Station for Northern Command. Soldiers would arrive at the SEP be
entrained, fed at a halt on the journey and then be de-trained at a station near a suitable camp.
Soldiers then marched, 4 or if they were fortunate, transported in WMT, to their temporary
accommodation. On arrival, each soldier was double-bunked with a garrison man, who offered
him some relevant comforts, such as a bed, blanket, eating utensils and a little hospitality, until
the BEF soldier could be re-equipped with basic personal equipment, a process which placed a
major burden upon the RAOC.
The Ordnance Services report on the recovery operation noted
that, 'As regards clothing, the BEF may be said to have arrived practically in rags, at least as
regards the 'DYNAMO' groups',5 a problem exacerbated at Army level because many soldiers
left equipment behind in the Reception Areas creating a requirement for more issues from
Command Ordnance Depots? The regimental history of the Cameronians briefly described
the process: 'On arrival at their destinations the troops were met and taken to camps, barracks
or billets. Each man was given &1 pay" and refitted with essential clothing, kit and equipment.

Rail movements at Dover Marine were complicated by the fact that trains could not easily be reversed
into the platforms. This meant drawing the trains into the platform with a locomotive that then had to
be released to shed after the train had departed. Tatlow, Return from Dunkirk. p.75. For a rail diagram,
