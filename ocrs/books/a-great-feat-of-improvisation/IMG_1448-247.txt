A Great Feat of Improvisation
The air situation remained in the Germans favour, but this had rather less effect on the Base
areas than the planners had envisaged because incendiaries delivered by air could have caused
considerable destruction in the Base depots. For most of the time however, the Luftwaffe focused
its activity on providing Offensive Air Support (OAS) and although logistic activity was
constantly interrupted, there was never a concerted effort to execute integrated Air Interdiction
(AI))78 on a widespread basis, thereby enabling key logistic activities to continue despite German
air superiority over much of France.
This good fortune enabled the RASC to participate in
two particularly successful operations during the withdrawal of 52nd (Lowland) Division.
On 17 June, after an urgent request from 157th Infantry Brigade to deliver combat supplies, a
composite convoy of 20 lorries from LOC Area delivered rations, ammunition and petrol from
dumps at Rennes! How this logistic crisis developed is not clear but it was either the result
of HQ 52nd (Lowland) Division failing to allocate logistic resources to 157th Brigade after the
withdrawal of the balance of the Division 80 or that 'G' at HQLOC agreed to arrange support
but did not consult 'Q. The LOC DDST war diary is clear that 'Q' was not informed that the
brigade had not been evacuated but sheds no light on the logistic planning processes with HQ
52nd Division, 81 although the failure to deploy, in a timely manner, the RASC assets to meet
the initial mission in France suggests fragility in this arena. That on 15 June 1940, CRASC was
tasked with providing two sections of 30 x 3 ton lorries, with both 155th and 156th Brigades
each receiving one to lift an infantry battalion per formation, seems to suggest that the focus
was on evacuation rather than support and the 157th Brigade requirement was forgotten. 82 In
another logistic success, 18 TCC RASC183 withdrew all the non-motorized elements of 157th
Brigade, 226 miles from Saint Anne Loir-et-Cher'®* to Cherbourg in 24 hours during 16-17
