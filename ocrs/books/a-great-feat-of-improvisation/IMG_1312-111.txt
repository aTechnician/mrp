in-experienced logisticians.8º All of these points were complicated by the arrival of TA divisions
equipped with a mix of 18 pounder guns and 4.5-inch howitzers, which in addition to the 18/25
pounders of the Regular divisions, initially created a growing fragility in ammunition delivery
and dumping, a problem resolved by the General Staff re-distributing the artillery equipment so
each division was equipped with all types of divisional field piece."? Many personnel were not
conversant with the new munitions and accidents were not infrequent. There was a particularly
unpleasant incident on 16 December 1939 at the II Corps Junior Leaders School when an anti-
tank mine exploded during a demonstration, killing three officers, critically injuring four, three
of whom died, and seriously wounding two others.83
Planning for in-Theatre ammunition stocks was based upon expected expenditure rates per
gun per day, the weapon population for each type and the numbers of days reserves directed by
the General Staff in GHQ. The planning baseline allocated each division 6 million rounds of
SAA and 1,500 anti-tank mines per month, with key daily tube consumption thus:8

During the inter war period, the War Office sought to replace the Great War 18-pdr field gun ang
the 4.5-inch howitzer with one weapon combining the high velocity of the 18- pdr and the variable
propelling charges of the howitzer, firing a shell of approximately 30 lbs. The result was the 2, par b
howitzer with an interim solution of a barrel modified for an 18 pdr carriage, which was the 18/25 par
that entered service in 1937. The deployment of the 18 dr gun and 4.5-inch howitzer combination
in BEF field regiments was a solution to the capability redirement provided by the 18/25 pd, bit.
