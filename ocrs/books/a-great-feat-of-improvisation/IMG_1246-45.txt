A Great Feat of Improvisation
Motorization and mechanization did not however, result in soldiers no longer marching. 208
(Sussex) Field Company RE (TA) discovered that having arrived at Orchies railway station'
near the Franco-Belgian border in late September 1939, the available WMT was dedicated
solely to move unit stores and the soldiers had to march 14 miles on pavel to the unit location at
Templeuve20 In much more demanding circumstances, 2nd Durham Light Infantry, amongst
many other units, combat, technical and logistic, discovered a similar problem during the
withdrawal from the River Dyle in 1940. Having marched for 28 miles in 24 hours they rested
in a village near Elinghen in Belgium, but the troop-carrying lorries failed to parade, and the
battalion had to march another 16 miles before the WMT arrived to take the soldiers off their
weary feet."
The motorization of the Army was a slow process, which had effectively commenced during
the Great War? and continued until 1937 when the Army declared that its Regular units had
completed the programme, although some yeomanry regiments of the TA retained their horses
and were deployed to Palestine in 1940 as part of 1st Cavalry Division.23 The RASC was the
first element of the British Army to be motorized, a process almost complete by 1929 and
the Corps, directed by QMG 3 in the War Office, initiated supporting structures to ensure
that the developing WMT capability was effective. As the motorization and mechanization of
the Army progressed, the centralization of the vehicle repair and stores systems was a natural
corollary but the concept was overrun by the complexities and dynamics of the rearmament and
expansion programmes, thus delaying the formation of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers until 1942.24 The RASC retained its integral Equipment Support units and kept
under Corps control, the Heavy Repair Workshop (HRS), the Vehicle Reserve Depot (VRD),
and the MT Stores Depot (MTSD) at Feltham. This enabled the RASC to ensure that its
reserves of vehicles and spares were fit for mobilization in 1939, although as military load-
carrier production increased to meet the plan of the thirty-two division Army, a new rail-served
VRD had to be constructed at Ashchurch25 in Gloucestershire.
Orchies is approximately 15 miles SE of Lille.
A cobblestone road, which was especially wearing upon the feet to march on.

that march will forget the discomfort of marching on "Pave'

The requirement for a second VRD had been articulated by the MG to CIGS in December 1935: 1
am inclined to think that we may have to establish in peace, elsewhere than at Fieltham, a second Vehicle
Reserve Depot supplementary to the existing one'. TNA WO 32/4612: Future Army Organization -

the British Army dated 9 September 1935. In 2020, the site is still in use by the MOD for the storage
P2.2 Vehicle storage enhancement. VRD Ashchurch was constructed during 1938-1940 to supplement
VRD Feltham. Located in the West of England, 2.5 miles to the East of Tewkesbury, to reduce the
possibility of crial attack, it was connected to the LMS Evesham to Tewkesbury railway line and
operated by the RASC, although between 1942-1945 it was a US Army depot. It remains in MOD
hands for military vehicle storage, and rail-served, although the sheds no longer have internal rail
loading platforms. (Steve Cheetham)
Inter-war Blues
The profile of military operations and the shortage of funding during the early 1930s was not
conducive to the purchase of large numbers of military specials so substantial orders were rarely
forthcoming. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, a range of 30-cwt and 3-ton 6x4 chassis26 was
developed by the War Office, in conjunction with the motor industry and these equipment
models became the foundation of the Army's military logistic vehicle fleet until the War Office
adopted the 3-ton lorry as the standard load carrier in 1940.27 Nonetheless, prototypes of some
26 The 6x4 chasis was the result of Great War experience.
27 The terminology for load carriers requires explanation. The rating of, for example, 3 tons, referred to
the operational planning lift of the vehicle, although the plated load was often in excess of this figure.
cample, the operational lift of the Bedford OYD was 3 tons (6,720 lbs) but the plated load was
3.61 tons (8,092 bs). The Bedford OLD also had a rating of 3 tons but was plated to lift a load of 3.675
tons (8,32 /bs), Tank Museum, Data Book of Wheeled Vebicles, Army Transport, 1939-1945 (London:
HMSO, 1983), p.53 (4) &x p.58 (51). Vehicles were sometimes loaded in excess of the plated figure
but inevitably this degraded performance and caused increased wear on components, including brakes,
