A rather different rail movement was the tour of the BEF, in
December 1939, of 80 students from the War Staff Officers Course at Camberley.10
Medical Evacuation
Prior to the advent of medical evacuation by air, 111 ambulance trains!12 delivered the strategic
and some operational movement capability in the Land environment and comprehensive
arrangements were enacted to provide this support to the BEF.
Pre-war Anglo-French staff
conversations generated two outputs.
First, an offer to provide the BEF an initial capability
using converted French stock 13 and secondly, the decision by the War Office to import British
ambulance trains from the UK, although because the Army held no deployable stock, the trains
were provided through a contract with the 'Big Four' railway companies, the LMS being the
lead company and thus providing all the rolling stock and producing the relevant conversion
drawings.
The other companies, GWR, LNER and Southern, in conjunction with the LMS,
allocated, to their workshops, specific projects within the programme, each company delivering
a particular type of vehicle. All coaches were LMS 57 foot stock and converted for ambulance
train operation in France.
Conversions included couplings, draw-gear and air-brakes for
Continental running, steam heating connections for French locomotives and bottom step-
boards for ground level access.

112 There is surprisingly little published on ambulance trains. The classic volume for a history of ambulance
train operations in the British Armed Forces is John I Plumridge, Hospital Ships and Ambulance Trains
(London: Seeley Service, 1975) but it only contains four pages on BEF operations
