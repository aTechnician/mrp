taken. The deployment involved Divisional Rear HQ, logistic units and all B Echelons moving
to a forward concentration area supported by three railheads: supply at Luton, petroleum at
Harpenden and ammunition at Dunstable, whilst road refilling points were established for
petroleum at Great Missenden and ammunition at Stokenchurch; 21 tanks moved by rail.56
Once these deployments were complete, it appears that interaction between divisional HQ
brigades and logistic units returned to a routine arrangement but in early April 1940, the war
diaries lucidly expose an increase in tempo, with training being reinvigorated and supported by
series of visits by the GOC to logistic units.5? 1 Armoured Division Ammunition Sub-Park
(ASP) participated in a Tactical Exercise Without Troops on 10 April 1940, focusing upon
the logistic contribution to 'Harbour Schemes' for armour, & whilst the Reserve Supply Park

detaching officers and NCOs to view a gas spray demonstration at Home Crossing in the New

Not content with effectively further
degrading the formation's strength and capability, the War Office ordered that the organization

much confusion as the division prepared to deploy to France, a situation compounded by the
neid deplyment of 3 Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) from 3rd Armoured Brigade for convoy
