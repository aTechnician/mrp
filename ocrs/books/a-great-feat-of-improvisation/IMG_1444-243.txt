A Great Feat of Improvisation
lorries returned in his words, 'all safe &t sound', to the DPC at 1900.17 This, and many other
operations, conclusively confirmed the effectiveness and importance of small well led logistic
teams, without which, the combat formations of the BEF could not have fought as they did.
There was certainly no lack of ingenuity from logistic Staff and units. Between 22 and 24
May several rakes of rail wagons loaded with ammunition, fuel and rations were extracted from
sidings almost in the front line and hauled to sites where they could be unloaded in the dark. 18
5 DAC unloaded ammunition trains at La Bassee but discovered that there were no explosives
or SAA tracer, 1' whilst 5 DPC120 alighted upon 76,000 gallons of cased aviation and MT spirit
at an abandoned RAF aerodrome. 121 Air supply was utilized to deliver rations, water and SAA
using air landed and air-drop, techniques. 22 On 22 and 23 May, 50 tons of preserved meat
and biscuit were delivered in 30 sortiesl23 Aying from Croydon Airport to Merville, 24 using
civil transports from the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOACC)125 and the Belgian
airline Sabena 126
This operation was not without risk, despite the RAF Hurricane fighter
escort 27 On 23 May, Me 109 fighters strafed the airfield whilst the BOAC AW 27 aircraft
were unloading, resulting in Elysian being burnt out, whilst on the return flight to Croydon,
Euryalus was struck in two engines by SAA fire from an enemy aircraft and upon landing at
Lympne in Kent was seriously damaged when the under-carriage collapsed 128 Further flights to
were deployed in operations over France on this date. Assuming the identification is correct, the most
likely candidate is the Heinkel 111P 1/LG1 from shot down by Hurricanes from 79 Squadron RAF,
which crashed at Masnuy-Saint-Jean. See, Cornwell, The Battle of France, p.241, which also lists the
names of the German air crew.

denied to the enemy but probably the RAF either urgently evacuated the airfield or that the POL, was
left with the expectation that the site would be re-occupied.

the remaining 320 tons that had arrived at Croydon Airport were cancelled when Merville

On the evening of 26 May, the RAF received a request to drop combat supplies to forces

Although a classic
mpe of improvisation, and lucidly demonstrating the co-ordination of the many different
ponent required to deliver logistic output, the airlift was unsustainable. The unfavourable
tuation demanded a fighter escort, yet still involved the loss of transport aircraft, whilst
communications also played a part because the RASC WMT could not be briefed if the
ination airfield changed. 134
