BEF combat logistics from Abbeville to Dunkerque and Beyond
Very Badly Hit
When the GLOC was cut, the three corps held on WMT, 2,000 tons of ammunition, 700 tons
of petrol but no supplies,' although materiel was held in dumps, and on trains the movements
of which, had been disrupted by the German attack. RASC units sent reconnaissance teams
out to establish the location and contents of the trains, which were estimated to be 300 tons of
ammunition, 1,350 tons of petrol and 450 tons of supplies' and from this point, the ingenuity,
zeal and improvisation of the BEF's logisticians flourished.
To sustain dynamic brigade
operations DSCs created supply report centres to control the flow of supplies through Supply
Points to units, whilst one formation RASC created mobile supply refilling points using 3
ton lorries with canvas shelters? At divisional level, the logistic RASC ORBAT, a company
for ammunition and one for petroleum, plus the Divisional Supply Column (DSC), initially
restricted Alexibility because if any one of these sub-units became separated from the formation,
divisions encountered severe logistic support problems,* and the structure created difficulties
in support dispersed deployments of independent brigades or changing tactical organization
within the division.'
