A Great Feat of Improvisation
generators and drilling machiness but because the derrick lift of the ship allocated to the task,
the HMT Marslew had a limit of five tons, the generator sets and heavy machine tools had to
be dismantled to meet the weight restriction. 1 HRS was however, unable to move some of the
electrical equipment packed to cases because the assigned lorry was re-tasked to troop carrying
operations. In addition, two workshop and three stores lorries reached the quay where the ship
was berthed but later arriving RAF technical vehicles were deservedly given priority's so the
HRS WMT and equipment had to be left on the dock. Denial was not authorised by the chain
of command but on his initiative the CO ordered the HRS plan to commence. Some equipment
was buried and vehicles awaiting repair were in some way damaged to prevent immediate use by
smashing cylinder blocks, gear-boxes and crank cases and by using oxy-acetylene torches to cut
frames and axles. Stores in the Quartermaster's Department were all doused with acid and the
5 ton transportable crane disabled. 1 MT Stores Depot had especially good fortune. When
a unit evacuation plan was first drafted it was expected it would take seven days to out-load the
site but with the assistance of SNCF, in 36 hours, the soldiers cleared by rail, all the engines,
major assemblies and tools, although 300 tons of other stores had to be abandoned, along with
11 railway wagons loaded with vehicle tyres, which were left at La Chapelle Station.
The large stock of winter clothing and blankets at the dry cleaning contractors in Paris, was
however, denied to the enemy by the industry of the RAOC Laundry detachment, whose OIC
arranged for the removal and then subsequent spoiling of the stocks.?? Denial by destruction
using explosives or petroleum, whilst an option preferred by many officers and soldiers, had
its hazards, as some members of 3rd Medium Regiment Royal Artillery discovered, when C
Troop destroyed its 6-inch howitzers by placing a shell with a 101 fuze in the muzzle and then
fired another with a 106 fuze from the chamber using a 200 yard length of signal cable as a
lanyard? The first attempt blew the howitzer into several pieces and the troop commander,
Captain Reggie Wiskin was blown off his feet. The second demolition resulted in the death of

from the Light Aid Detachment was fortunate to survive, when having poured 20 gallons of

kiring effective denial that the regimental history should record the results appertaining to
the destruction of some of the British Army's thousands of vehicles: 'The scene at Houthem was
forgettable.... here the last vehicles of the BEF were burnt or destroyed. Hundreds and
