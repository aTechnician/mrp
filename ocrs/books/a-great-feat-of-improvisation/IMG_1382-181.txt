A Great Feat of Improvisation
constructing a siding at Braye, a SNCF marshalling yard to the South-East of Rennes for No
1 TSD RE using materials and tools from SNCF, on 15 September 1939, two days after the
unit arrived in France.
The siding was completed on 26 September with work commencing on
constructing the rail works in the depot, supported by labour from 17 Company AMPC, on 2
October," a detachment of 186 Transportation Construction Company arriving on 3 December
equipped with excavators and dumpers to speed the construction activity.52 On 20 November,
work started at Bruz to build the rail facilities for 1 Base Ordnance Depot (BOD), SNCF
installing the connection to the main line on 18 December, whilst construction of the railway
sidings for 4 Petroleum Oils & Lubricants Depot (POLD) at Moult Argences was initiated on
20 December. 53
Essential to these outputs was the work of 156 TSC, which arrived in mid-September' and
was responsible for supplying rail, switches, fishplates and supporting railway infrastructure
accessories. 156 TSC controlled No 1 TSD at Braye and managed the development of No 2
TSD at Carquefou to the North of Nantes, which was in-loaded during October with 5,371
tons of stores on 19 trains.55 Holdings on 31 October 1939 were sufficient to construct nine
miles of single track and by the end of November this had increased to 31.34 miles. During
October 1939, it handled receipts and issues of 8,500 tons in 602 wagons, increasing to 11,455
tons in 679 wagons by December 1939. Also essential to railway construction was ballast, 1,000
cubic yards of which, was required to each mile of single track. 57
One RCC required 1,000 unskilled labourers to operate at maximum efficiency. In the
summer, a RCC could lay about four miles of track per week, and in the winter, 2.5 miles." The
reduced output was not only a product of the more challenging winter meteorological conditions
but also less daylight, which in Northern France is only eight hours in mid-December, or
possibly less depending upon the weather conditions but in excess of 16 hours in mid-June.
The 156 TSC war diary summarized the problem: "No work has been done at night. It is very
difficult and somewhat dangerous to off-load rails and sleepers by hand at night, unless very
good floodlighting can be arranged. 5º The winter of 1939-40 in Northern France and the
United Kingdom was the coldest since 1895,6 compounded by the most persistent lying snow
since 1879, so there was severe disruption to the progression of some of the works, many of
which were not completed before the evacuation in June 1940.61

The daily tone requirement for aerodrome construction and BEF defence works required 14
tris pr dem but the output from the quarries usually only delivered eight, so inevitably these
yet fell behind schedule. 2 The severe cold of February and March 1940 did however, create
ria it engineering opportunity. At the airfields, the aggregate for the concrete usually
mind at a railway spur or siding and was then transferred to the site by road, a considerable
it sarag f 10,000 tons was required for each site. With the ground frozen hard,
te SCR spurs were often extended onto the runway work sites on un-ballasted track thereby
removing double handling using WMT, which thus increased the distribution flow rate, whilst
rohing the labour demand. Once the thaw came in late March, these temporary tracks
are must and were removed but they were a most useful temporary expedient.*
