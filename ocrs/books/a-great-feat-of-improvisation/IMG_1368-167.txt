A Great Feat of Improvisation
which prompted the deployment in January 1940 of 129 Forestry Company RE, the members
of which were, by 1 February, hard at work logging in the snow-drifts around Crecy, using horses
and sleighs to remove the products of their industry from the forests.* This activity, conducted
in tough winter conditions was perhaps more reminiscent of a scene from British operations in
North Russia during 19195 rather the BEF in France in 1940 but lucidly illustrates the array of
logistic units employed. It was also an excellent example of the vital need to make the necessary
arrangements with the Host Nation authorities, without which, the logistic process generally
deteriorated into frictional administrative attrition.
Reducing the visual signature of the BEF's military infrastructure, including Base depots,
logistic dumps, defence works, gun sites, vehicles, field headquarters, accommodation and
aggregate heaps was a critical component of operational security, which relied upon the
logisticians? Initially all the nets were made by units from canvas strips which were issued in
rolls of 100 yards length. The strips cut from the rolls, were two or three inches in width and
garnished nets of 14' x 14' and larger respectively, and were stocked in four shades: dark and
light green, brown and loam.® Given the developments in infra-red photography, instructions
were published to ensure that natural foliage was used in conjunction with the artificial strips to
achieve best effect.' To increase the availability of the nets a camouflage factory was established
in a disused mill at Le Houlme on the main Rouen to Dieppe road equipped with plant from
the UK. Production commenced on 11 December 1939 utilizing local French female labour, 4
of whom were employed by Christmas rising to 125 by the end of March 1940 and out-turning,
per week, 125 nets, with the supporting frames. In April because of a shortage of twine and
an increase in net requirements, a decision was made to use wire netting, which was more
difficult to work, necessitating an additional floor space and labour.
The factory also produced
a prototype dummy tank, five of which could be carried on a 3 ton lorry, and after off-loading,
be assembled by three men. 10
The development of the Advanced Base behind the corps areas consumed a considerable
amount of Staff time and effort, whilst the engineering and transportation resources required
In June 1940, 129 Forestry Company was employed in the light infantry defence role and was evacuated
through Saint Malo on 17 June 1940, except for Second-Lieutenant Condor who was searching for
