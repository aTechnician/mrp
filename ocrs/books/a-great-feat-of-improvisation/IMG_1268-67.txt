The QMG to the BEF was effusive, noting that, 'The original plans for movement of the BEF to
France and for its initial maintenance were worked out in great detail by the War Office before
the outbreak of war, and after reconnaissance in France?" Given that the BEF's formation and
deployment! was the result of five years of political dithering, incoherent defence policy, 3 rapid
expansion, military improvisation and scrambling modernization, * its dispatch was indeed the
result of an impressive feat of planning and execution, although in some areas under-pinned
by considerable and sometimes uncalculated risks. Of especial note was the reliance upon
Volunteers from the Supplementary Reserves to man the Docks Groups and the Movement
Control organization, both which were vital to effective and efficient deployment and yet were
not well practised, a fragility which had it matured, could have so easily proved embarrassing at
best and catastrophic at worst.!5
Both the planning and execution phases had inherent fragilities and limitations caused by
several factors including time restrictions, excessive security and insufficient attention to key
aspects of logistic detail, including Host Nation infrastructure capability, rail transportation
agility, French mobilization requirements and unit 1st Line integrity but by the end of September
1939,6152,031 Army personnel and 9,392 RAF were in France and the size of the Force grew
almost daily, reaching 438,686 by mid-May 1940.* The regimental historian of the 13th/18th
Royal Hussars noted the move of the BEF to France as having worked perfectly, which in
the Regiment's case appears to have been the case, but it was not an observation that could
be applied to every aspect of the deployment.l8 By mid-June 1940 however, the equivalent of
fifteen infantry divisions, plus the 1st Armoured Division, had moved to Theatre, a remarkable
achievement, although there were deficiencies in equipment, training, coherency and logistics,
faws which industry and commanders sought to resolve as quickly as possible.20

German invasion in May 1940, the intention, in June, was to form a fourth corps, with a concomitant
