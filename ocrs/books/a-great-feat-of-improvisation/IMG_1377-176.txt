Appointed by and reporting to GHQ140 in order to co-ordinate the operations of the Reserve
Area logistic component with the Force W Brigade and HQ Third French Army, was an Area
Commandant whose duties were laid down in Field Service Regulations'41 but from practical
experience these were locally amended by the incumbent to deliver the relevant outputs 42
Effectively the Area Commandant was the Deputy Assistant OMG (DAQMG) to Force W,
although the post also involved ensuring RE material was appropriately supplied, which was
usually the responsibility of a CRE, and acting as Assistant Provost Marshal. This was an
appointment that whilst only graded at the rank of major, required an officer, whose inter-
personal and professional skills, in dealing with a combination of brigadiers and above, Host
Nation HOs and the technical logistic experts in the Force, needed to be of the highest quality.
The Area Commandant's key internal task was monitoring logistic stock levels to ensure the
appropriate combat capability was maintained. This was of especial importance during the

Amy: The most significant concern was developing a close relationship to ensure that French
git spot was effective and that the rotating brigades remained inside the French military
ad ria social envelope. Matters such as obtaining large quantities of food from the local
conomy by units, which generated area shortages and price inflation, the protection of farm
cimal and the care of billets, were all contentious issues that required constant attention from
the ra HQ and two specific concerns, which HQ Third Army raised, involved units burning
rote candles in barns and discarding razor blades into farm straw.!45
A particular issue was the effective operation of the reverse logistic chain for the refilling
