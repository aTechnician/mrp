continued to fill cans until 26 May when the unit suspended operations and withdrew.4 Once
the GLOC was cut the Corps Petrol Parks could no longer draw fuel from the PRHs but sought
supplies in dumps or ran the loop from the BPFC at Lomme 47 DPCs were almost completely
dependent upon dumps, 48 and although civil stocks were an option, 2 DPC avoided their
use to obviate the possibility of using fuel that had been sabotaged with sugar by the Fifth
Column. Short-term urgency often overtook longer-term importance in distribution and after
being tasked to provide fuel for units from other divisions, 2 DPC issued the last stocks on
27 May." Distributing fuel was not without risk. Low-level strafing by the Luftwaffe was a
constant threat and during daylight RASC units usually moved in small groups of vehicles to
mitigate the effects of an attack. Indeed, experience quickly suggested that 10 vehicles to the
mile was the maximum density that could be operated safely in an adverse air environment,
but despite these precautions, dive-bombers attacked 50 DPCS at Estaires on the evening of
22 May resulting in one soldier killed and eight wounded, with several vehicles destroyed and
damaged 54 2 DPC also suffered a fatal casualty on 25 May 1940 when approximately eight
fighters attacked three lorries near La Bassee, the section commander factually reporting that
Driver Booth, driving the middle vehicle, was dead at the wheel shot through the head, he
was killed while the vehicle was in motion, because his lorry had crashed into the back of the
leading lorry?56 Death, wounds and injuries inflicted upon vehicle drivers mounted as the BEF
