being taken on 21 May, although on 20 May, the BEF's AQMG, Lieutenant-Colonel Hewer
travelled by air to the UK for a meeting at the War Office to discuss arrangements for a possible
evacuation, a proposal initially rejected. 8' Whether these two GHQ approaches were the result
of assessed contingency planning or a conceptual dissonance within the HQ is difficult to define
from the documents. Either way, the NCP option was the only effective solution to maintain or
evacuate the BEF in the North and the logisticians applied their industry and talent to creating
a GLOC from the facilities and units that were in-situ? A Base Sub-Area HQ was established
in Dunkerque, located with a GHQ QMG Staff Section, both of which were closely integrated
to the British and French naval authorities," whilst the Army logisticians, Royal Navy and
Merchant Marine demonstrated the ability to not only 'hot' plan but also deliver and support
ad hoc forces to France.
Upon the direction of the War Office, 3 BSD at Le Harve had loaded 2,500 tons of general
supplies to the SS Belgravian," the ship sailing for Boulogne on 21 May?3 20th Guards Brigade
deployed as a protection force to the port on 22 May, the disembarkation being delayed by
military evacuees crowding the quays, whilst discharge had mostly to be undertaken by hand
because power to the dock cranes had failed.* To protect logistic operations in Calais elements
of 30th Brigade also began landing the same day? The work to create this new GLOC has,
understandably, been completely overshadowed by the later evacuation from Dunkerque but it is
clear that given different operational conditions there are strong reasons to suggest that it was a
sustainable solution, although there were several key enablers identified by the BEF QMG Staff
planners, without which, failure was considered inevitable. These included: effective active air
defence measures by the RAF and Army AA units; each port being able to handle 1,000 tons
per diem and be supported by rail and road out-load capacity; sufficient supplies being delivered
to sustain Belgian and French forces and feed the civilian population." These were certainly
tall orders and from the logistic perspective, operations were assessed to be achievable provided
