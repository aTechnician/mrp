A Great Feat of Improvisation

the Atlantic Quay Cherbourg in October 1939. Left to Right: Staff Sergeant D
McGilroy, Private R H Woodward, Sergeant W G Combe (s?) MM. (RLCM:

P5.8 Rummy Tummy. Many of the logistic sites in the Base initially had poor restaurant
facilities leading to issues with health, hygiene and morale and thus, inevitably, to a
reduction in capability. (RLCM: RAOC/WTB1/RAO/373/3)
P5.9 A Lighter Logistic Moment. Note the RASC Suppliers jacket and the anti-
gas eye-shield tucked into the service dress hat chip-strap. (RLCM: B3/SRB/

P6.1 Ocean Terminal. Shell-Mex bulk tanker and storage on the River Tyne at Jarrow
in the late 1920s. Despite the pre-war plan for fuel distribution to rely upon the
disposable can, limited bulk fuel commercial capacity was introduced to provide a
reserve immediately before the BEF's deployment, with the concept being slowly
expanded. (RLCM: POL/RASC/NOR)
P6.2 Bulk Fuelling by Road. Thornycroft Road Tanker of 1930. Whilst the 'flimsy'
took priority in fuel distribution, the concept of bulk refuelling using road tankers
did not evaporate and was expanded to support units in the Base Areas and airfields.
(RLCM: A1b/MT/ Tankers 5474)
P6.3 Bulk Refuelling by Rail. To enable bulk fuel distribution to be extended to BEF
combat formations, contracts were placed to manufacture RTCs to provide the
lift from the Base to the corps areas, with IWT being utilized to a limited extent.

P6.4 Can Recycling. The disposal 4-gallon can, created a appreciable handling and
recycling burden, much of which, involved rail transportation. (RCM: B6/

P7.1 Ammunition Production. Significant sums of Public money were expended to create
a munitions production capability within the UK, of which ROF Swynnerton in
Staffordshire was but one facility. One of the many specialized buildings with a rail
platform that remain on site in 2018. (Author)
P7.2 Munition Production and Distribution. Transportation and especially the railway,
were vital in delivering raw materials to the factories and distributing the finished
products. The Ministry of Supply branch line from the GWR at Caldicot Junction
Monmouthshire to RNPF Caerwent in 2008. (Author)
P7.3 Ammunition People. Experienced ammunition staff were at a premium when
the BEF deployed to France, a problem exacerbated by the increasing expansion
of munitions production. It was therefore surprising but most fortunate that there
were very few ammunition incidents of consequence. 3 Base Ammunition Depot

P7.4 Ammunition Storage.

storage compounds at RAF Barnham Suffolk, which opened in August 1939 under
the control of 94 Maintenance Unit (Author)

enemy action, poor drills or instable ammunition. (RCM: RAOC/WTB2/NOR) 220

ATS to conduct specific AQ tasks to release manpower to combat roles. (RCM:

distribution of water is a lacuna in the logistic historiography of the BEF. (RLCM:

were established in France. (RLCM: ACC/1939/VR/NOR)

P10.4 Age Shall Not Weary Them? AMPC soldiers preparing for deployment to France
in October 1939 at the former Butlins Holiday Camp at Clacton-on-Sea, which
was opened in 1938. The age group is of note, with many soldiers wearing Great
War medals, thus indicating men in their forties plus, the corporal on the left of the
picture being an exception. The maturity of mant AMPC soldiers became increasing
logistic and health issues during the harsh winter conditions in France. (RLCM:
