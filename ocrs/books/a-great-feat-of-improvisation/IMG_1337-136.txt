The role of AQ in planning and delivering the BEF's leave programme 1939-1940
The AQ Challenge
A key GHQ AQ task was to plan, resource and manage the movement of thousands of BER
personnel travelling in France and UK who were undertaking leave, courses and meetings, in
addition to the visitors, individual rotations and returnees from medical treatment in the UK.
This chapter will analyse the plans and processes that supported the movements aspects of
the leave programme, which was not only by far the largest task of the administrative routine
movement activities but also the one that had sensitive morale and political implications, whilst
requiring substantial resources, a prominent element of which, was rail and sea transport
capability.
In this respect, the successful delivery of the programme relied greatly upon
capardination between the G, A and Branches in GHQ especially the Finance Branch
and Q (Movements). As the Force grew, leave movements rose from 1,700 personnel in each
direction in December 1939 to an expected 2,200' in May 1940, and was projected to reach
2,500 by July.
To place this ever-increasing movements problem into perspective, the BEF expanded by
22,300 personnel in November 1939, adding another 280 soldiers per day eligible for leave in
February 1940, and creating an additional daily movements task of 560 accounting for outbound
and inbound trave Cute descensible for the movement fIR AF personnel in the Ai

small numbers of RAF personnel sometimes flew to UK, whilst RN personnel might take
passage on HM Ships. In addition to the numbers involved, there was also a cultural issue to be
managed because of the different experience, comprehension and expectation of the disparate
groups travelling within the BEF's leave and movements system. The movement out fall from
these policy decisions was considerable.
