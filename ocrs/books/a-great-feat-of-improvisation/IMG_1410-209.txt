A Great Feat of Improvisation
forward-based elements of the Heavy Bomber Force equipped with the Wellington had the
evacuation from the Continent not intervened. 42
To compliment the spray systems, the RAF also fielded iron bombs filled with HS Mustard.
Bombs, Aircraft, Low Capacity (LC) 250 lb and Mk I LC 30 ib, were fuzed weapons of
conventional appearance. They functioned on impact using the tail ejection principle in which
a small internal burster blew off a lightly welded tail plate, the liquid fill being dispensed around
the point of impact with the minimum loss into the crater. 43 Individual Mk I 30 lb bombs
contaminated a much smaller area but dropped in sticks, accuracy was not only less important
than with the 250 lb LC weapon but also several areas of contamination were created across
the target."* There were 42,000 Mk Is charged with HS Mustard, held in the UK, although
because of a fuze production failure, only 10,000 were ready for issue and another 18,900
awaited filling. 15 The Bomb, Aircraft, LC, 30 1b, Mk II, was a fuze-less weapon, loaded to an
eight-bomb cluster container.4 The key logistic issue with the Mk II was the short shelf life
after the fill, which precluded ready use stocks in France. 4,000 empty bombs were therefore,
held in the UK ready for charging, which of course created a transportation issue in moving
quickly them to the AASF. Plans were also discussed, which aimed to enhance SW capability
by filling petrol tins and 45 gallon oil drums with HS Mustard to make up shortfalls in 30lb
and 250 lb bomb production; this proposal was, to the relief of those who were tasked with
handling them, abandoned.
Inter-Theatre Movement Operations
The movement of SW to France was a highly sensitive activity, which was run under the
codename Operation FLANNELFOOT.+7
The planning and delivery of the operation was
the subject of considerable debate within the War Office, the Air Ministry and the Ministry
of Transport. The planning and movements Staffs had the experience in handling and storing
SW from the Great War to guide them, and more recently, the shipment, in August 1939, of

ile SCIs and 250 1b LC bombs to Egypt. 48 This was undoubtedly useful in focusing minds on
ome of the complexities relating the management of SW but many had to be resolved as they
speared. In 1939, SW, regardless of whether they contained propellants or High Explosives,
nite classified as Group XIII explosives, the storage, transport, maintenance and disposal of
nich, were subject to civila and military regulations.So 'Heavy case' weapons, as shells and
irens drums" were described, had been moved during the Great War, and this knowledge was
puto good use in 1939. Leakage did occasionally occur but for the most part, the robust nature
if the containers reduced the chance of failure. The carriage of 'light case' weapons, such as the
SO, BCVs and chemical mines, created a different problem. The container skins were designed
bethin to permit a high liquid to weight ratio, but this made them vulnerable to damage in
mast. Much effort was therefore, expended to ensure that the appropriate safety procedures
ver apied: 126 gallons of liquid Mustard spilling from a ruptured BCV onto a busy dockside
visnot a matter to be taken lightly. The chemical mine, although only containing four gallons
Mustard but fitted with a gunpowder burster charge required equal respect.? The instruction
