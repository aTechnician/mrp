projects, for example the aerodromes, which were usually sited in locations isolated from piped
supply. The RE had though, an important remit because it was responsible for finding, raising,
collecting, and where necessary, purifying, water before distribution to the user, water being
required for drinking, cooking, hygiene, medical, laundry, heating, locomotives, construction,
power generation, chemical decontamination, vehicle radiators, equipment wash-downs and
animal care. 16 The BEF daily requirement for water was substantial with a Base general hospital
needing 250,000 gallons and an infantry base depot 130,000. Logistic facilities were equally
demanding as Table 10.1 illustrates, with the figures increasing as sites expanded and activity
levels rose.
Construction projects could consume significant quantities because 18-24 gallons"
of waterls were required for each cubic yard of a cement, sand and aggregate mix to produce
concrete,' enormous quantities of which, were required to build pill-boxes on the Gort Line"
and for aerodrome runways.
