One of the unforeseen advantages of these losses was the elimination, almost overnight, of the
extensive type range of the 20,000 impressed vehicles. This created an opportunity to standardic
equipments, although because of the experience of operations on the Continent, and the need
to replace the losses, there was a view, quickly dispelled by the war in the Western Desert, that
vehicles manufactured to civilian specification were acceptable to support manoeuvre warfare.
The War Office selected the 3-ton lorry as the standard load-carrier, and although severa.

different manufacturers produced their own type, 13l there was some standardization. As the
war moved into 1941, there was an increasing emphasis on the 4x4 vehicle but because many of
the bodies built for the 6x4 system during the 1930s were still in use, this chassis continued in
production until the end of the war.
Conclusion
The British Army had been through a very challenging period but some of the lessons identified
from the French campaign relating to military specifications were not learned until operations
in the Western Desert made the need absolutely clear. Impressment met a remit beyond its
original concept, which at least motorized the BEF and enabled it to deploy to France with
some mobility. The ES outfall was in effect unsustainable and had the BEF not been evacuated
in June 1940 there would have come a time when the impressed vehicles would have to have
been replaced by military specification types and the civilian vehicles returned to their owners.
In this respect, the losses sustained in France created an opportunity to re-balance the fleet
and although the solution had imperfections, it was far better than the alternative of retaining
the commercial impressments.
As industrial production increased, military specification
WMT began to flow from the factories, although having greater standardization of types would
have improved operating availability through more efficient ES systems and driven down the
spares inventory, whilst also reducing the requirement for logistic lift across the transportation
spectrum. The failure to ensure that there were sufficient HETs to support the expanding
armoured formations was a lucid indication that the G and the Staff were out of kilter, and
unlike the load-carrier, the planners and vehicle manufacturers were unable to provide a quick
solution, although the BEF was not alone in failing to properly plan for field vehicle recovery

Austin K3 (4x2): 17,000
Austin K5 (4x4): 12,280
Bedford OL (4x4): 52,248
Bedford OY (4x2): 72,385
Fordson WOT6 (4x4): 30,000
