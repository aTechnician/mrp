gallons daily, whilst the daily consumption rate for an armoured division in offensive operations

The disruption to the cased in-load would have been critical had pre-war planning not stolen
a march on the failure. Through a secret contract with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company enabled
by the Société General de Huites de Petrole, the War Office had imported 200,000 x 2-gallon
returnable cans and hired two 5,000 ton tanks at Donges, five miles to the East of Saint Nazaire
on the River Loire, for MT spirit, although a small inconvenience was that one was filled with
diesel, so it had to be discharged and cleaned. On 6 September 1939, using female labour,
Anglo-Iranian commenced filling the returnable cans from the bulk stock of French alcoholised
petrol at Donges,* from which, the cans could be railed to BEF locations. Filling proceeded at
300-400 cans per hour? and the BEF hired from the Host Nation, additional five and 50 litre
cans for the Army and 200 litre barrels for the AASF26 Thus of the proposed total of 25,500
tons of fuel in-Theatre by M+32, 19.6 percent, 5,000 tons, were converted to bulk stocks. Of
the 25,500 tons, 8,000 was allocated for the BEF to move to its Concentration Area, and 5,000
tons for 15 days of half operational rate and 20 days at operational rate. 27
In the Base, road-served POL Depots (POLD) were established at Blain and Saint
Thegonnec, with the former planned to be rail-served with a connection to the Société Nationale
des Chemins de fer Francais (SNCF) network. 29 100 ton Detail Issue Deports (DID) stocking
cased fuel were quickly established at Brest, Rennes, Laval, Le Mans and Douai using road and
rail transport to support the Main Base Areas (MBA), the GLOC and its staging areas. Plans
were confirmed with the French for cased fuel sites at Arras for 700 tons of packed fuel with
road and IWT access and another one at Bethune for 400 tons, with a further 1,250 tons spread
aros sites in Beauvais, Calais, Cambrai and Dieppe using road, rail and IWT capability.
Five further facilities totalling 1,750 tons located in the vicinity of Calais, Dieppe, Paris and
Sint Quentin were also identified. " In addition, the French agreed to allow packed fuel to be
shipped through the port of Caen, a solution enacted in October 1939, with the subsequent
