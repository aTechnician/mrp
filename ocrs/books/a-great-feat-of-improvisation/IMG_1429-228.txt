Maintaining an operational Ground Line of Communication
A Fire in the Garage
The first BEF logistic loss on 10 May 1940 was not caused by enemy action. 2 Ordnance
Field Park (OFP) supporting II Corps was based in the Sallaumines district of Lens when a
fire broke out in a garage the unit occupied, the resulting conflagration destroying five motor-
cycles, a battery carrier and several charging lorries with a 6-inch howitzer badly damaged,
which was hardly an auspicious start to the campaign.! A rather sadder event in il Corps on

was an important reminder of the vital role of efficient traffic control, ' particularly during the
advance or a withdrawal, to the operational capability of an army, a lesson that would be firmly
reinforced during the campaign in France.®
The forward deployment of I and II Corps to the defence line on the River Dyle was conducted
using rail and road. Trains conveyed supplies, stores, ammunition, petrol, some troops and

a very significant operation because by 1940, an infantry division was established for 1,812
