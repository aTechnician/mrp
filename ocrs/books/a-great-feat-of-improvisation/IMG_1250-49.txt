A Great Feat of Improvisation
Commercial Conversions and Military Specials
The motor industry provided the Army with many new builds, some of which were civilin
designs with production militarization delivered through various modifications includin
increased ground clearance, enhanced fuel capacity, more robust springs and upgraded power
plant cooling systems. In addition, dual rear wheels were often replaced with singles, cros
country tyres fitted, and a range of military fitments added such as tilts, extra tool bins and
carriers for petrol, oil and water cans.
"The 3-ton 4x2 types were particularly well suited t
military adaptations, with the most common, the Austin K3.63 the Bedford OY64 and the
Commer Q4.65 The Austin was based on a civilian vehicle which the company had started to
produce in 1939 as part of its return to truck manufacture. It had a 3,462 cc spark ignition 6l
bhp engine, a four-speed constant-mesh gearbox and hydraulic brakes.
'The military version
sported an open cab and twin 3.4 x 17 rear tyres on the early models, later versions having ?
slit top closed cab and single 10.50 x 16 tyres.
The Bedford OY was mechanically similar to
its civilian brother the OL but featured the wide flat fronted bonnet of the MW. Powered by
a 3,519 cc spark ignition engine, it had a fuel tank capacity of 32 gallons and hydraulic brake
with vacuum servo assistance.
The early models had 32 x 6 dual rear tyres, but these wer
replaced by 10.50 x 16 singles all round in later builds. There were many variants of the bast
chassis: the OYD was the GS version and the OYC tanker for fuel or water, carrying 800 or
350 gallons respectively. The Rootes Group Commer Q4 was closely related to the civilian
Superpoise, which entered production in 1939. Powered by a 4,086 cc 81 bhp SI engine it was
initially fitted with twin 3.4 x 17 tyres on the rear axle, although these were soon replaced by
10.50 x 16s singles all round.
There were however, limits on the capability of civilian vehicles pressed into military service.
Government road transport taxation policies during the inter-war period had an impact on
the size and power of some of these commercial vehicles; high taxes and a speed limit of 20
mph on lorries over 2.5 tons un-laden resulted in volume production being concentrated on
smaller classes, which tempted vehicle manufacturers to use the largest of their car engine
(30-cwt)," OY (3-ton) and QL (3- ton) " all had a 6-cylinder 3,519 cc SI engine, giving 72
bhp at 3,000 rpm, which meant that the 3-ton lorry was under powered, especially for cross-

fuelled with diesel, which because of its size and weight, was usually confined to vehicles with a
load capability of 6 tons and above. In the round, the trend of commercial design was towards
vehicles of low weight, power and ground clearance, all characteristics in direct contradiction
to military requirements. Whilst there was some utility for these equipments in France, the
Middle East was a very different proposition
The Army's greatest problem was that despite the recognition of the importance of the
military special, so well learned from the Great War and inter-war colonial operations, there
was no capability to place these vehicles into mass production, so the shortcomings of the
Defence Requirements Programmes, lay not so much in the failure to equip the Regular Army,
as in the inability to provide, until it was to late to be effective, the war potential to support the
expanding Territorial Army.?3 At a tactical level, whilst the War Office had discussions with
Vauxhall Motors they did not mature to any immediate orders; the Bedford MW 15-cwt truck74
