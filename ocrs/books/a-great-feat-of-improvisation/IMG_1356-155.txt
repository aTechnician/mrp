A Great Feat of Improvisation
Reverse Logistics
Reverse Logistics,42 which has a much longer history than its promotion in 2020 would suggest,
had been highly developed on the Western Front in the Great War, initially by the Royal Flying
Corps and then generally by the BEF.
Whilst nearly all of the ground force material in late
1939 was initially uni-directional and consumable, the experience of the Great War drove the
need to quickly develop the processes of salvage, 1* reclamation, reconditioning and re-issue of
a variety of materiel that was deemed vital to logistic sustainability, a task lucidly articulated in
Field Service Regulations.*7 As the BEF expanded, Reverse Logistics was expected to create an
increasingly important output that would reduce the cross-Channel shipping demand, whilst
battlefield clearance supported the re-use and recycling of materiel,8 activities that Great War
experience suggested would rely upon French civilian female labour.* The Reverse Logistics
culture was under-written by constant reminders to economise on the use of everything unless
there was an operational imperative not to and the importance of the 'War on Waste' is brilliantly
exposed in an open circular entitled 'Economy' to All Ranks signed by DA & QMG I Corps:
He ended the circular, with an exhortation: 'While we are not fighting the enemy let us fight
42 Operations related to the reuse of products and materials, by moving them from their typical final
destination of use for the purpose of capturing value or proper disposal. Casualty and medica
evacuation are in a conceptual sense, a component of Reverse Logistics.
43 Salvage also had a direct financial contribution. In the first six months of 1917, the estimated savings
from the Paris Ordnance Depot totalled £961,716, which is £445,800,000 in 2016 values based on the

output of the economy. TNA WO 95/59: Director of Ordnance Services, WD, 11 November 1917
44 Salvage had two components. Battlefield Salvage involved weapons, ammunition, shell cases, clothing,
equipment, vehicles
and trench materials, whilst Normal Salvage consisted of logistic items such as
packing cases, wood baulks, dunnage, fuel tins, blankets and accommodation stores.
Returnable fue
cans were not salvage unless an item was classified as Bevond Economic Repair (BEK)

As an example of the wide-ranging reclamation activities, in the month of September 1918, Fourth
Army reclaimed 1,057 pounds of solder from bully-beef tins and the like. TNA WO 95/445/5: HQ

Battlefield clearance is the removal of all military materiel, including enemy, from the field of batle

In 1918, the Paris Ordnance Salvage Depot employed nearly 4,000 French women and was focused on
clothing salvage.
