A Great Feat of Improvisation

India, tested various components of the British Army's logistic capability. (RLCM: A1/MT/

rail movement training and practice, activities also undertaken by the RAF.16 Off the rails, the
RASC was at the forefront of military logistic vehicle innovation.
The fourth factor was continuing logistic doctrinal development, which looked beyond the
colonial focus and examined the future challenges in a Continental manoeuvre environment.
The RASC sought to capitalize upon emerging mechanical transport capability, which offered
more capacity, and with the production of more capable cross-country vehicles,! greater
mobility.
The RASC Training College at Aldershot has been described in the period as a
'hotbed of innovation'8 and RASC studies, supported by trials at the Mechanical Warfare
Experimental Establishment at Farnborough, identified a series of issues in relation to effective
support to divisional level operations, including traffic control, defence against air attack, vehicle
maintenance, recovery and repair, ammunition supply and the distribution of Petrol, Oils and
Lubricants (POL)!' Liquid fuel supply for the motorized and increasingly mechanized future

Cinderella and the Pumpkin
Army was not however, solely RASC business and in 1935, the QMG to the Forces, 2 responding
to a paper by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) outlining the future options for
the reorganization of the British Army, incisively articulated its importance: 'Petrol ... is the
life-blood of the 1st Contingent we propose to put in the field' 2 All of this conceptual work,
reinforced by trials and exercises in the UK and abroad, combined with a new divisional RASC
structure created a robust and resilient organization? that proved capable of modification to
meet the greater dispersion and mobility of tracked armoured forces, although the deployment
and recovery of tanks at the operational level was not resolved and remained in limbo before
becoming a hard lesson of 1940. From 1928, the RASC was also a key player in a series
of Wheeled Motor Transport (WMT) experiments, trials and exercises in Egypt to test and
improve logistic support in desert operations, resulting in a series of not only Lessons Identified
but also Lessons Learned, with particular emphasis on passive and active defence against air
and ground threats.4 This work was essential to refining RASC support to the developing
Mobile Division in Egypt and culminated in early 1939 with the formation being allocated four
WMT companies, directed by a Commander RASC.45 Colonel D C Cameron OBE RASC,
Commandant of the RASC Training College in the late 1920s, initiated much of this work
and his innovation and industry was a key driver in integrating operational RASC units to all
combat formations. 26
The last and indeed, defining factor in the deployment, sustainment and redeployment of any
British expeditionary force was the critical role of the maritime dimension, which not only was
effectively out with the control of the War Office, but also was on a strategic scale that dwarfed
the Army's influence in its provision, although equally the scale of the logistic lift it could provide
in relation to the proposed expeditionary force suggested that this was the one aspect that the
