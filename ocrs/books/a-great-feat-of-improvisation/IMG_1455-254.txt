decision and more energetic steps' could stocks have been reduced, 17 the first key action was
taken on 24 May, when 1 BAD was ordered to out-load 6,000 tons to the ports, although
the execution of the task was disrupted by the requirement to receipt ammunition on trains
being returned to the depot because of the closure of the GLOC to the corps areas.108 On 29
May, OS 2 instructed ADOS (Ammn) to evacuate to the UK, 50 percent of all ammunition
stocks not required for operations in France,1º' which appeared to be a simple order but the
calculations involved to issue detailed instructions to the BADs as to the types and quantities
to be exported were based upon a dynamic force structure. ADOS (Ammn) chose, therefore,
an initially cautious solution by returning those stocks, which were in obvious surplus, namely
6-inch howitzer and 25 pounder munitions. ADOS (Ammn) also raised the issue of the denial
and possible destruction of ammunition in-Theatre, although the three formal requests to GOC
LOC for the latter failed to elicit a decision, o with the result that whilst the BADs prepared
plans for denial and demolition, only the former was enacted.
On 1 June, the CO 1 BAD was directed by ADOS (Ammn) to out-load a further 7,000
tons of ammunition to the UK, close the depot by 25 June'' and establish an Advanced
Ammunition Depot (AAD) at Bretueil between Le Mans and the Seine. 12 A reconnaissance
revealed that the site was unsuitable and with events overtaking the logistic planning, the
BAD were ordered to move stocks to a site near Niort to the North-East of La Rochelle but
this option was also abandoned. 13 At this point the main effort was clearing the depot in the
Foret du Gavre and in addition to out-loading stocks to the ports, there were substantial issues
of demolition explosives to the Royal Engineers and two convoys of AA ammunition were
dispatched to Saint Nazaire 14 Arrangements were then made to destroy by demolition the
remaining ammunition but the CO received specific orders from HQ Nantes Sub-Area that

reducing the planned stock holdings across the Theatre and reposition them in the UK Base, although
this is not explicit in the report.

izes tubes and detonators were trucked to the coast and dumped in the sea, whilst the depot
if commenced burning the cartridge propellants and crushing the RAF bomb-tails. On
June, demolition parties prepared all the dumps with fuzes and detonators but when they
anet conduct checks the fuzes had been removed, the suspicion being that members of the
al French military were involved because the Town Mayor had stated that the population
is very worried and angry' about the possibility of their villages being damaged if the dumps
ite destroyed. 118
In adition to the demolition plan, the staff established a dump near Brest for 200 tons of
munition to support the local defence scheme. 19
