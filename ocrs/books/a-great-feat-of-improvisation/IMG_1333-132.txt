A Great Feat of Improvisation
for Newhaven for the cross-Channel journey, by merchant steamer, to Dieppe. Controls were
strict. Each visitor was issued with a two-page brief, a Casualty Visitor Pass, a Travel Warrant 105
an Embarkation Card, 106 a Movement Order and three rail tickets.
Hospitals and units were
not responsible for hosting relatives, who were met by a member of the British Red Cross or
the Saint John's Emergency Committee, who accommodated them, and made arrangements for
them to travel to the hospital by car, or, if it was outside the Dieppe Medical Base Sub-Area, by
rail. Visitors were not allowed to travel unaccompanied in the military zone.
Despite exceptionally low levels of combat activity, there were plenty of soldiers who became
sick, or who were injured, and in the period 1 October 1939 to 30 April 1940, 10,344 soldiers
were evacuated to the UK.107 Of this total, 1,514 suffered Non-Battle Injuries (NBI)108 in RTAs
and incidents involving firearms, explosives, assaults, falls, sport and training whilst on duty or
on recreation; only 9 were wounded by enemy action. 109 In addition there were 281 fatalities as
a result of NBI events, 11º one of whom was the CO 1 RWF, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Fenton
Garnons-Williams, who was killed when the 13 Squadron Lysander in which he was flying,
force-landed near Aix on 10 November 1939 whilst conducting a reconnaissance; the pilot,
Pilot Officer B S Jones was not injured. 111 85 percent of the 10,344 evacuated to the UK, 8,830,
suffered a wide range of illnesses and disease, 12 a situation partly generated by the particularly
harsh winter of 1939-1940.13 In the period October 1939 to June 1940, 1,451 were evacuated to
the UK with respiratory illnessesl1 and 297 with heart conditions.ls Of import, was the rising

108 This figure does
not give full visibility of the numbers of NIBI because it only relates to those evacuated
to the UK and does not include those admitted to BEF hospitals and discharged to units or those
treated in the unit or a field ambulance. In May 1940 there were a further 1,751 NBI personnel andin
June, 1,450. See, W Franklin Mellor (ed.), MBOH, Casualties and Medical Statistics London: HMSO,
