new depot at Blain, 13 a site close to 1 BAD, with two double ASDs. In-loading commenced
on 24 May, with the arrival of 23 rail wagons of RAF Smoke Curtain Installations (SCI)
containing liquid Mustard, and free-fall gas bombs, which were later evacuated to the UK from
Saint Nazaire in an interesting if somewhat complex move. Over a period of two and a half
days WMT transferred the weapons to a canal-side site five miles from the depot, where they.
were transhipped to a barge for a three day journey to Saint Nazaire 140 By 14 June, 6 BAD
had in-loaded 2,200 tons of munitions, most of which were RAF HE bombs, plus 3-inch and
3.7-inch HAA and SAA.141 Two specialist BADs were also formed. 5 BAD, originally planned
to operate a rail-served site at Blain was designated 21 BAD, to control a road-served site at
Tourville-les-Ifs, four miles South of the SPOD of Fecamp, which was opened in December
1939 for the storage of RAF aerially delivered gas bombs and SCIs, although it also held Army
GW artillery munitions.!42 22 BAD,143 a rail-served site, was opened at Chateauneuf-d'Ille-et-
Vilaine, 144 eight miles South-East of SPOD Saint Malo, to service small munitions shipments
through the port. 145
