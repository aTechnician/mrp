the ensuing fire and the subsequent explosions of munitions, severely damaged or destroyed at
least five trains, demolished buildings and inflicted heavy troop and civilian casualties; 115 the
initial crater from detonation of the ammunition train was estimated to be 240 feet long, 60
feet wide and 15 feet deep. Rescue and recovery efforts were hampered for the next 24 hours by
exploding munitions and the intense fire; some of the victims were never recovered.
Many sources suggest that it was an exploding French ammunition train that caused most
of the damage. Research in the TNA offers a nuance to this interpretation because the 4
BAD WD is specific in stating that between late 15 June and 2200 on 16 June 1940, three
ammunition trains had been dispatched to the Rennes BMY, for consignment to Saint Malo,
so it remains a strong possibility, given the interruption to train paths that British munitions
were at least partly responsible for the post-attack explosions.117
Whatever the catalyst, the
result was approximately 805 military and civilian fatalities and a 1,000 wounded. 118 177 British

117 Interestingly, the 4 BAD evacuation report in the war diary does not mention any British munitions
contribution, stating that the incident involved a British and French troop train and a French munitions
train. See, 4 BAD/BW/1 dated 23 June 1940, Report on Evacuation of 4 BAD by Commanding
Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel G Caruana Dingli, in TNA WO 167/1178.
