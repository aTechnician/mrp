A Great Feat of Improvisation
Divisional Ammunition Company_
The Divisional Ammunition Company (DAC) was organized into a headquarters, a workshop
and support section, and three transport sections, & the latter with a mixture of equipment
and tasks established so each section, ALPHA, BRAVO and CHARLIE carried ammunition
for an infantry brigade within the division and one third for divisional troops. In addition
each section had two unallocated vehicles, equating to 10 percent of the tasked strength, as an
operational reserve, generating a total task? vehicle establishment of 76 within the company"
The BEF possessed a limited number of wheeled medium mobility load-carriers and this was
reflected in the ORBAT of the DAC.
Only ALPHA section had this equipment, in the
form of four 6x4 lorries, to support the 4x4 tractor drawn 18/25 and 25 pounder guns, whilst
CHARLIE section was a replica of BRAVO,41
There were a number of different types of
Small Arms Ammunition (SAA) that were carried including 0.50-inch for the Vickers Heay
Machine Gun (HMG) mounted on the Light Tank Mk VI and 7.92 mm for the Besa Medium
Machine Gun (MMG) mounted on the Light Tank Mk VIC and the Cruiser Mk II (A10). The
DAC ammunition one-time lift is shown in the table below.42
