A Great Feat of Improvisation

and consequently the 'Supply' focus remained.® One important outfall from this change was
the failure to analyse the future opportunities for the coherent integration of the compression
ignition power-plants fuelled by diesel oil,' to military vehicle design, with the Mechanical
Warfare Board only reporting, if often comprehensively, on commercial developments, rather
than driving potential military specifications and applications!" This situation was compounded
by civil vehicle taxation and road haulage legislation," which was infuenced by the politics of
rail transportation. 12
Mechanization and Motorization
responsibility for the three directorates, Director Military Operations & Intelligence (DMO &
I), Director Staff of Duties (DSD) and Director Military Training (DMT) in relation to vehicle
procurement was for the most part, clear. DMO & I forecast the type of operations for which,
provision was required and evidence of the threat against which, equipment should be designed.
DSD issued general vehicle specifications, although in effect DSD only monitored this for WMT
and defined future populations against the ORBAT from DMO & I. DMT directed tactical
and employment training through several Arm and Service Directors, based upon the RASC
model established in 1907, although this lapsed during the Great War. Mechanization was
however, well underway by 1934, a memorandum prepared for the 1935 Estimates Committeel3
lucily explained the problem in defining 'mechanization' under two headings:
(1) The employment of the internal combustion engine as a substitute for the horse.
(2) The employment of the internal combustion engine to obtain tactical advantages
on the battlefield by means of armoured fighting vehicles.
The former might be more effectively described as motorization and the latter, mechanization.
The term 'mechanization' described the introduction of Mechanical Transport to the British
Army, both wheels and tracks. In the pre-Second World War period, the term 'mechanize' was
used to describe the equipping of horsed Regular cavalry regiments with light or cruiser tanks14
and infantry battalions with tracked carriers. 'Motorization' usually referred to WMT both
for logistic carriers and for the carriage of combat troops, and infantry battalions so equipped
were termed motor-battalions! The motorization of the Army, whilst an increasingly pressing
requirement militarily, was also driven by the decreasing availability of light draught horses
in the commercial sector as they were replaced by vehicles powered by internal combustion
engine. A 1935 War Office memorandum summarized the problem: the increasing difficulty
of obtaining light draught horses' makes progress in mechanization increasingly urgent apart
from any other advantages to be gained thereby........ mainly (sic) for this reason, it has been
decided that the Territorial Army will go to war on a fully mechanized basis?!?
