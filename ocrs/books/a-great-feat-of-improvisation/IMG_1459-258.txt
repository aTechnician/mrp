A Great Feat of Improvisation
evacuation was mainly thwarted when some of the drivers, many from hastily organized ad hoc
units, deserted their vehicles and took passage on departing ships.
The remainder of the WMT
was abandoned owing to French objections to destruction and 'it was considered unwise to
overrule them', a decision fully supported by the Howard Committee, which noted in its report
that 'it would have been unjustifiable at this stage to antagonise the French, whose assistance
was of great value. 182
The pressure, frustration and confusion were concisely summarized in the war diary of HQ
157th Brigade evacuating through the port of Cherbourg.
The Brigade Major exercised immense
energy in searching for transport to lift the personnel of the brigade HQ from Transit Camp D
to the docks, and 'eventually lorries were promised in an hour', the plan proving useless because
by then the general rumour was that ships were all sailing within an hour 183 Meanwhile the
brigade Staff Captain and the Motor Transport Officer, demonstrating the strength of character
and resolute determination that in a crisis is so crucial in delivering effective logistic output,
were engaged in leading a team to load the brigade HQ WMT, even persuading the brigade
commander 8* to take a break from arranging the provision of tea for the troops to put a 'shoulder
to the wheel', although by all accounts he did not require much encouragement.
The work
commenced in the dark, but their efforts were not in vain because all the WMT was loaded
except for the 8 ewt vehicles, the Staff Captain reporting that if there had been more drivers
available, additional WMT could have been loaded, 185 which confirms that greater quantities
of equipment could have been recovered with more planning and grip.
Despite the frenetic
activity on the quaysides of the French ports, there were officers and soldiers who brought
calm and order to the confusion, much of which was caused by the last-minute orders for the
evacuation, poor communications and the inevitable chaotic unit arrival by train, vehicle and
boot. A member of 1st Armoured Division remembered:
I must say that what impressed me about the docks in Brest was the sense of order.
There was no alarm or undue agitation; and that must have been due, at least in part,
to this same Embarkation Staff Officer. I have no idea who he was, and in the ordinary
course of nature he must be dead by now; but I gladly pay my tribute to him here... He
was the sort of man of whom, like Milton's sonnets, there are "alas, too few", 186
