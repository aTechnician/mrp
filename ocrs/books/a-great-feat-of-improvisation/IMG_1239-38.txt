man more, that the essence of our effort depends on production.") The strength of the British
Army is not only in Aldershot and on Salisbury Plain; it is in Woolwich and Nottingham"" The
Master-General of the Ordnance (MGO) was of the same opinion: "We cannot get away from
the fact that the possibilities of munitions supply really govern the whole problem?" Whilst
production was focused upon UK capacity, design was not and the War Office sought solutions
from abroad and built the weapon systems or modified designs under licence. One example
is the Ordnance SBML 2-inch Light Mortar Launcher, which was developed from a 50 mm
design by the Spanish company Esperanza y Cia. Others included the 0.303 inch Bren Light
Machine Gun (LMG) from Czechoslovakia and the 40 mm LA A gun from Sweden."

Minney, The Private Papers of Hore-Belisha (London: Collins, 1950). Of interest, is that in the Great
War, Hore-Belisha held a commission in the Army Service Corps, although he attempted to transie
to the Royal Flying Corps but was unsuccessful. He served on the Western Front, in Salonkia and it
Egypt, returning to Oxford in 1919 to complete his studies.

By December 1938 the five-division deficiency programme was planned to have been completed.
Production however, continued in 1939, with 114 weapons in a and 248 in 2 totalling 1,000 by the
end of the year; Ibid, p.103, Table 10.
the Cabinet reluctantly accepted that a major continental deployment's was not only inevitable
should war with Germany break out but was now an essential element of an alliance with France,
and a potentially important insurance against German seizure of airfields in the Low Countries.
The Cabinet thus promised the French Government that four infantry divisions would be sent
to France within 33 days of mobilization, with the first of two armoured divisions arriving seven
months after the main deployment? In April 1939, the Cabinet also approved the expansion
of the Army, Regular and Territorial, to thirty-two divisions," completely overturning previous
positions, whilst sanctioning the concomitant expenditure. The War Office was tasked with
planning the dispatch of these forces to France after the start of mobilization, called Z. Day.
"This was a significant task because some of the formations had yet to be established and there

76 Only 14 months before, in February 1938, the BEF's future commander, Viscount Gort, had informed
the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID) whilst CIGS, that:
.. if the Field Force were sent

mstances it would be murder to s

transpired the equipment was not the defining weakness.
