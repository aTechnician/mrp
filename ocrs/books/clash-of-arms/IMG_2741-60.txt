rotated between divisions and, consequently, joined battle without the
familiarity needed for good teamwork and effective combined-arms opera-
Despite these deficiencies, the army in the ETO on the eve of D-Day
was far superior to the one that had landed in Tunisia eighteen months ear-
lier. It had greater firepower and mobility; it was more flexibly organized
and better coordinated, and had improved tactical air support. If one com-
pares the 1939 and 1944 U.S. armies, one sees that its firepower had grown
appreciably, its mobility vastly increased, and its proficiency in combined-
arms warfare and in air-ground operations had improved. Most important
of all, the U.S. Army had demonstrated an ability both to learn quickly
from its combat experience and to adapt rapidly by improvising and retrain-
ing in the field, even during combat operations. This army identified defi-
ciencies quickly because it exhibited an honest and serious commitment to
gather and analyze combat lessons and to identify and rectify problems. It
was quick to learn, innovate, and adapt despite an informal, decentralized
The learning process by which ground forces adapted during World
War Il clearly reflected broader American cultural characteristics. The
American democratic tradition of individualism, competition, and entrepre-
neurial spirit encouraged innovation. As soldiers, Americans displayed con-
fidence in their ability to find solutions to problems, and their ill-defined
class distinctions meant that the army was receptive to ideas from junior
officers and enlisted personnel, 135
Other factors help to account for the flexibility and adaptability of the
army. Doctrine can be refined and perfected during wartime as long as it is
not fundamentally flawed. A key factor in the wartime success of the U.S.
Army was that it was able to hone its combat skills and reorganize effec-
tively because combat proved much of its prewar doctrine to be essentially
sound. The army's managerial approach also contributed to its flexibility
and success, with the result that the wartime army produced a number of
highly effective divisions. 136
Circumstances also allowed the army to reorganize, adapt, and inno-
vate effectively. That the United States experienced twenty-seven months
of peace after the outbreak of war in Europe was a major advantage that
allowed its army to embark on a well-planned, thought out, organized, and
executed program of expansion, reorganization, and reequipment. The
country's geostrategic position was of course a benefit: since enemy action
rarely directly threatened the contiguous United States, the army was able
to pursue mobilization, reorganization, and adaptation undisturbed. The
size and topography of the United States was also conducive to large-scale
maneuvers that allowed the army to discern quickly existing deficiencies.

Kingdom at the beginning of June 1944 suggested that they were reason-

ably well prepared doctrinally, tactically, materially, and mentally for the
coming audit of war. U.S. forces had already demonstrated that they pos-
sessed the resources, skill, and flexibility to overcome the gruelling and
unpredictable test of battle that they would face in Operation OVERLORD.

Curtis Shrike, the Norththrop A-17 and A-18, and the Douglas A-20. Gordon

4. Race hatred in the Pacific Theater fueled atrocities on both sides, intensi-
fied and prolonged Japanese resistance, and threatened to divert the United States
from the Allied strategy of defeating Germany first. Thus, in the summer of 1943
the majority of U.S. forces remained in the Pacific. Dower, War without Mercy;

5. Few significant improvements materialized after September 1939, though
by June 1940 the army had grown in size to 257,095 regulars, 226,837 National
Guardsmen trained by individual states and exercised for two weeks each summer,
and 104,228 trained officers from Reserve Officer Training Corps and citizen mili-
tary training camps in the Organized Reserve Corps. Kent R. Greenfield et al., The
Organization of Ground Combat Troops (Washington, D.C.: OCMH, 1947), 2.
6. The army included twenty-seven infantry, four armored, and two cavalry
divisions. It absorbed 278,526 National Guard personnel and by July 1941 had
inducted 606,915 selectees. Greenfield, Organization, 10.
7. In summer 1940, the army and National Guard comprised 13,797 and
21,074 officers, respectively. In addition, there were some 33,000 reserve officers
plus 104,228 graduates of the Reserve Officer Training Corps.
8. In May 1943 the army removed a mere four officers but in December 1943
the figure rose to 287. Robert Palmer and William R. Keast, "The Procurement of

Between the wars the tiny U.S. Marine Corps developed a specialized
amphibious warfare capability to preserve its organizational independence and held
ten annual fleet landing exercises. The participation of the Caribbean Amphibious
Force in the 1941 exercises illustrates the early U.S. shift toward offensive training.
