The "portee" mounted the 2-pounder on the back of a truck. It gave
increased mobility, but it was so vulnerable that it was withdrawn from service in
December 1942. Bailey, Firepower, 173.
118. When German armor isolated the the 2d Battalion of the Rifle Brigade
during LIGHTFOOT, its 6-pounders destroyed thirty-two tanks. Playfair,
Mediterranean IV, 56.
119. "Battlefield interdiction" was "direct support" in British parlance. U.S.
tactical air support doctrine emphasized the former more than close air support.
British doctrine advocated balance between both. Hallion, Strike, 149-162.
120. Montgomery, played an important role in the genesis of air-ground coor-
dination because he favored air force control and believed that the massed use of air
power in support of the ground battle was a battle winning formula. PRO WO

portion of armored fighting vehicles." Winston Churchill, Their Finest Hour
133. The 1942 mixed division, which traded an infantry brigade for an
armored brigade, aimed to enhance coordination, but entrenched regimentalism
ensured that the experiment failed. The army's tinkering with organization reflected
a misguided effort to rectify more fundamental problems and Montgomery, for one,
vehemently opposed the mixed-division concept. IWM MP BLM 49/14, letter,
Montgomery to Brooke, 12 January 1943.
