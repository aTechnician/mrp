could not overcome its most significant deficiencies: its loss of mobility, its
weak logistic base, its poor intelligence capability, and its lack of interser-
vice coordination. At the same time, nazi racial dogma continued to warp
German perceptions of the combat capabilities of their opponents. Despite
growing evidence to the contrary, most German commanders continued to
perceive the more racially pure "Anglo-Saxon" British as better soldiers
than the mongrel Americans whose racial purity was so diluted that they
could not be proficient soldiers. 126 Nazi racism thus led the Germans to
underestimate American fighting qualities and their ability to adapt. Only
after the COBRA breakout did the German military sharply revise its esti-
By then, of course, it was too late. By late summer of 1944, staggering
manpower and equipment losses had torn the heart out of the Heer and
reduced it to positional defense. The edge in raw fighting power that
German formations had possessed throughout the war had now diminished
to the point where quality could only delay the triumph of the law of num-
bers.127 That the war lasted another nine months is a testament to the cohe-
sion, discipline, professionalism, and adaptability of the Heer. Equally,
though, it testified to the brutality, racism, fanaticism, and myopia of the
German military.

4. In fact, the breadth of the bridgehead was more important than the depth
for a viable lodgement, a fact that both Montgomery clearly recognized in his
broadening of the invasion frontage in spring 1944 and Rommel perceived with his
heavy attacks on the airborne bridgehead east of the Orne to roll up the Allied flank.
5. Only a single battalion defended the coastal crust supported by another
battalion inland and an Eastern battalion of limited combat value.

were central to U.S. difficulties at Omaha Beach. Yet, the forward-deployed 716th

7. Rommel took advantage of the bad weather to travel to Germany, General
Fetchinger (21st Panzer Division) to be with his mistress, Gens. Sepp Dietrich and
Wolfgang Pickert (III Flak Corps) as well as Cols. Hans von Templehoff (Rommel's
operations officer) and Wilhelm Meyer-Detring (OB West operations officer) to
take leave, while Adm. Theodore Kranke was at a birthday party in his honor. Many
senior Seventh Army officers, including its chief Dollmann, and Generals Palley
(91st Division), Hellmich (243d Division), and Schlieben (709th Division) were en
route to a map exercise at Rennes.

advanced position at about 1,500-2,000 meters, and the MLR at 5,000 meters.
13. The SS worldview of hardness promoted iron discipline, aggress actical
and uncompromising refusal to accept defeat, which sometimes overrode tactical
sense and brought heavy losses, as witnessed by the suicidal attack of the 12th SS

routinely cycled through instructor positions, and this reward proved one of most
effective inducements for battlefield heroism. Paratroop recruits and Labor Service
troops conducted a tenacious defense during the battle for Cherbourg, for example.
