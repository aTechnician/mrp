88. In June 1931, for example, the PAM and NPAM stood at only 53 percent
and 38 percent, respectively, of authorized strength. Stacey, Six Years, 5.
89. The PAM comprised three infantry and two cavalry regiments. During
the Depression training declined further. During 1931-1932 only 2,182 troops
trained on average for 4 days, and one militia battalion exercised just twice as a unit
between the wars. Stanley, Soldiers, 339-343; William E. J. Hutchinson, "Test of a
Corps Commander: General Guy Granville Simonds, Normandy 1944," M. A. the-
sis, University of Victoria, 1983, 57.
90. In 1935 the militia possessed two armored cars but no antitank guns,
mortars, or Bren guns. Lt. Col. E. L. M. Burns, "The Defence of Canada,"
Canadian Defense Quarterly, 13, 4 (July 1936), 341.
91. In 1924 Canada spent one-sixth of what Britain spent per capita on
defense. Hutchinson, "Corps Commander," 56.
Defense spending increased 19 percent during 1936-1937, but the
Militia's share fell from 61 percent in 1936-1937 to 50 percent in 1938-1939.
93. During 1935-1939 the strength of the PAM increased 19 percent while
reorganization slashed NPAM cavalry regiments and infantry battalions, raised new
machine gun battalions and fifty-two artillery batteries, and earmarked eight battal-
ions for mechanization. Stanley, Soldiers, 346.
94. For a more positive evaluation of the effectiveness of Canadian military
reform in the late 1930s, see Stanley, Soldiers, 344-354.
The title "mobile force" was misleading because the planned force com-
pletely lacked mobility. Stanley, Soldiers, 352; Harris, Brass, Chap. 8.

99. Lt. Col. Georg Bruchmüller developed accurate massed fire without the
ranging fire that warned of an imminent attack. Storm troops were elite attack
squads strong in firepower that infiltrated enemy trench lines. These combined tac-
tics restored mobility and surprise to the offensive at Riga in September 1917 and at
Cambrai in November 1917. Bruce Gudmundsson, Stormtroop Tactics: Innovation

banned from possessing planes, submarines, or capital ships over 10,000 tons.
