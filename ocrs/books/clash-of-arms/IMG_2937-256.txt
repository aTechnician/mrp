About the Book
Clash of Arms examines how the Western Allies learned —on the battle-
field—to defeat the Nazi war machine.
Beginning with an investigation of the interwar neglect that left the
Allied militaries incapable of defeating Nazi aggression at the start of
World War II, Hart examines the wartime paths the Allies took toward
improved military effectiveness. He also explores the continuous German
adaptation that prolonged the war and increased the price of eventual Allied
victory. Central to his comparative study is the complex interplay of per-
sonalities, military culture, and wartime realities that determined how accu-
rately the combatants learned the lessons of war, and how effectively they
enhanced their battle capabilities.
Russell A. Hart is assistant professor and specialist in modern military his-
tory at Hawaii Pacific University. He is coauthor of German Tanks of World
War II, Weapons and Fighting Tactics of the Waffen-SS, Panzer: The
Illustrated History of Germany's Armored Forces in WWIl, and German
Soldier in World War HI.
