82d Airborne Divisions. Samuel Mitchum and Friedrich von Stauffenburg, The

95. That Patton faced mostly demoralized Italian defenders facilitated his
rapid advance, while Montgomery had to engage elite German mechanized troops
and paratroopers. Mitchum and von Stauffenburg, Sicily, 196-213.
96. The paratroopers were scattered over 65 miles and less than a company

98. The most serious limitation of U.S. artillery effectiveness in Sicily, as in
Tunisia, was constant munitions shortages.

101.
During 1942-1943 the USAAF was poor at providing photographic and
visual reconnaissance. The 11 July 1943 airborne assault on Sicily tragically illus-
trated poor recognition skills and fire discipline: friendly fire shot down twenty-
three transports and damaged a further thirty-seven. Mitchum and Stauffenburg,
Sicily, 127-130.

106. In Tunisia and Italy, pooled independent tank battalions proved much less
effective than divisional ones because pooling brought frequent rotation through
divisions, thus hampering the development of the familiarity, trust, and confidence
crucial to effective combined-arms teamwork. Lessons from the Italian Campaign,
22-27; Doubler, Closing, 17.
107. Lt. Gen. Jacob Devers, chief of the Armored Force, for one, did not
believe that pooling brought either unity of command or economy of force.
Greenfield, Organization, 271-276.
108. The historical antecedents of the RCT were the U.S. Army sublegions of
1792-1796. A typical RCT included a divisional artillery battalion and engineer,
signals, and medical companies. Stanton, Order of Battle, 13.
109. Only on 14 June 1944 did the army retreat from pooling and authorize
the semipermanent attachment of independent battalions to divisions.
110. From January 1944 the army deactivated, on average, sixteen antiaircraft
and two tank destroyer battalions each month. Stanton, Orders of Battle, 6-7.
111. The March 1944 Lucas review board led to the activation of additional
heavy artillery battalions. Between June 1943 and April 1945 the number of medi-
um and heavy artillery battalions increased by 69 and 211 percent, respectively.

114. The 1st Special Service Force was a composite U.S.-Canadian special
forces brigade. Raiding forces comprised six army Ranger battalions. The army also
employed several Office of Strategic Services operational groups on sabotage mis-
sions behind enemy lines. Stanton, Order of Battle, 14.
115. The infantry program established the Bronze Star medal for "heroic or
meritorious achievement or service," introduced the Expert and Combat
Infantryman badges, and increased pay. Palmer, Procurement and Training, 62-64.
116. After 22 April 1944 the army cadred 22 divisions at home and stripped
91,747 personnel from them before their departure overseas. Bell I. Wiley "The
Building and Training of Infantry Divisions," in Palmer, Procurement and Training,
117. In spring 1944, the army classified some 210,000 troops stationed in the
United States as fit for overseas combat service. By fall 1944 almost none
remained. Ibid., 80-81.

120. The Mustang was a high-performance, long-range escort fighter that
combined exceptional performance with good range and endurance as a fighter-
bomber. The Thunderbolt was the best fighter-bomber of the three and very rugged.

had emerged extemporaneously.
