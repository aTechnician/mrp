7. Without the British-Canadian failures in Normandy, it is unlikely that
Hitler could have counterattacked in the West at all in 1944. On German success on
the Seine and Allied failures in September, see RAF Museum, Hendon, Bombing

10. The constant controversy over whether attached units were "under com-
mand" or "in support" exemplified the lack of combined-arms doctrine. PRO CAB

Montgomery confided that "I would even risk the total loss of the
armoured brigade groups to carry out these tacties." His boldness did not predicate
an intended major British offensive role, as Carlo D'Este has contended, but reflect-
P Montgomery's awareness of the need to secure quickly a viable lodgement. PRO

14. Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) poorly
assessed the topography in its invasion planning. For the effect of terrain in the
Noraign, see Arthur Davies, "Geographical Factors in the Invasion and Battle of
Normandy," Geographical Review 36 (October 1946), 613-631.
SHAEF assumed that the Germans would conduct a delaying withdrawal
to the Seine and make a stand there. It thus tardily addressed executing a breakout
battle just prior to D-Day. H. P. Willmott, June 1944 (London: Blanchard Press,

Division is Craig H. Luther, Blood and Honor: The History of the 12th ss Panzer
Division "Hitler Youth" 1943-45 (San Jose, Calif.: R. James Bender, 1987). Less

21. Provost marshals constantly complained about the reluctance of com-
manders to report those absent without leave (AWOL). Brigadier Hargest was
amazed on a trip to Cherbourg, in early July, at how few stragglers there were in the
U.S. rear compared to the British situation. PRO WO 171/167, TFAG Provost

PAT were "slim." The greatest achievement of a PIAT in Normandy was o WiS
29 lement of a German armed trawler in the Caen Canal on D-Day. PRO WO
