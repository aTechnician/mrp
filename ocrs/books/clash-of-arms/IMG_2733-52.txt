ments of mechanized cavalry, artillery, and combat engineers; made their
battalions independent; and reorganized them under newly activated group
headquarters.42 The army also dissolved fixed regiments of service troops
and rearranged them into flexible, self-sufficient companies attached to bat-
talion headquarters. These reforms made the composition of field forces
more flexible and streamlined units in accordance with the principle of
economy. Since the army maintained much of its combat strength in nondi-
visional units (see Table 2.3) this reform was of major significance. 43 Army
reorganization between 1940 and 1943 thus forged a more flexible, sinewy,
and powerful fighting force to join combat in the ETO late in 1942.
However, despite retraining, reorganization, and reequipment, the AGF
generally failed to forge fully combat-ready divisions prior to commitment
to action in the ETO. Given the immense task that confronted the army at
the start of the war, it had come a long way-perhaps as far as anyone
could have expected. By the fall of 1942 the army was capable of limited
offensive action, and it clearly forged its offensive capability more quickly
than its Anglo-Canadian allies. Here, the extra two years of peace were of
critical importance in allowing the U.S. Army a better planned, organized,
and executed expansion. The army's managerial approach also played an
field force.
important role in facilitating an ordered transition to an offensive-oriented
In keeping with its offensive doctrine and its desire to defeat its ene-
mies far away from the United States, the army sought the earliest possible
commitment to the European theater. Having to fight a coalition war with a
more fragile and war-weary partner, however, proved fortuitous for it was

The United States, 1939-1944: The Leviathan Awakens

only in the face of adamant British opposition that the Americans aban-
doned Operation SLEDGEHAMMER, the quixotic plan for a 1942 inva-
sion of France. 44 Thereafter, the United States pinned its hopes on a 1943
invasion, ROUNDUP. In retrospect the compromise that inevitably attends
coalition warfare proved beneficial, for, as the Dieppe raid illustrated, a
1942 invasion attempt would surely have ended in disaster. None of the
Western Allied armies then possessed significant offensive capability, nor
the amphibious assault techniques, landing craft, and logistic support, let
alone the aerial and naval mastery, that guaranteed them success in 1944.45
It must be stressed that the 1942 U.S. Army remained ill prepared to tackle
the Heer in strength. It did not have the troops, heavy weapons, or the
logistic base in the United Kingdom to mount a successful invasion. 46
Determined that U.S. ground forces join combat in the ETO in 1942,
President Roosevelt instead committed the II U.S. Corps under overall
British command to Operation TORCH, the Allied invasion of French
North Africa on 8 November 1942.47 After landing at Casablanca, Oran,
and Algiers, the Allies dashed to capture Tunis before winter and quickly
Wrap up the campaign. But limited strength, inadequate logistic support,
overextended lines of communication, and a rapid German reaction ensured
that the campaign dragged on until May 1943.
The deployment of U.S. forces in strength on the periphery where the
Germans were weak proved sou 1 strategy. Although it delayed the inva-
sion of France until 1944, the Mediterranean diversion brought the army
invaluable combat experience that paid enormous dividends in northwest
Europe during 1944-1945. Combat in Tunisia demonstrated that serious
deficiencies remained in the preparation of troops, flaws that brought sev-
eral serious local reverses. These setbacks shocked the army out of compla-
cency and resulted in renewed efforts to enhance combat capabilities.
Troop performance was uneven and initially poor, and U.S. forces often
advanced recklessly and with little coordination.
This allowed the Germans
to inflict a number of local defeats on the green troops, the most serious of
which occurred at Kasserine Pass in February 1943.48 This defeat taught
the Americans several valuable lessons; in particular, it revealed the weak-
nesses of unseasoned troops and the heavy price of inferior equipment. 49
An important element of the army's wartime success was its determi-
nation to learn from its combat experience and to refine its doctrine, tactics,
and organization in the light of combat lessons.50 Indeed, General McNair
firmly believed that the final arbiter of military effectiveness was combat
itself. The application of strength against German weakness made Tunisia
a particularly valuable learning environment for U.S. ground forces.
Relatively light casualties guaranteed continuity in personnel, which
allowed combat lessons to be readily absorbed. 52 Despite uneven troop per-
formance during TORCH, the campaign proved that army doctrine was
essentially sound. Combat demonstrated the superiority of the offensive
