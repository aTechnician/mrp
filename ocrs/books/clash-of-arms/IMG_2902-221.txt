ing ambulances to carry military supplies and using hospitals to store weapons.

52. German planners estimated that they required 20,000 tons of supplies for a
counteroffensive and daily delivery of at least 4,500 tons, yet the Seventh Army's
available truck transport capacity was only 1,300 tons. NARA T-313, 1566, AOK 7,

53. The 9th SS Panzer Division and the attached Battle Group Weidinger (2d

guns, plus nineteen antitank and infantry guns. NARA T-354, 147, 3789052, 9. SS-

54. British intelligence estimated that the VIII Corps would meet only 120
German tanks, whereas in reality the Germans had 300 tanks and assault guns east
of the Orne. PRO WO 285/3, Second Army Int. Sum. 43, 17 July 1944; NARA T-

55. The 21st Panzer Division's 200th Assault Gun Battalion equipped with
Marder I tank destroyers, in particular, effectively harried the British advance. Hans

56. It was the eighteen surviving 88mm antitank guns of the forward-deployed
1039th and 1053d Artillery-Antitank Battalions, not the seventy-eight Luftwafte
Flak 88s deployed on the Bourguébus Ridge, that inflicted most of the damage.

confuse the British defenders. Although Typhoons flew numerous sorties they nei-
ther halted the German attacks nor inflicted significant damage. The 124th Typhoon
Wing claimed only two kills. Alex Vanags-Baginskis, Aggressors, Volume 1: Tank

claimed the destruction of ninety-three. NARA T-311, 17, 7018868, Pz.Gr. West,

59. Estimates of British loss figures have varied enormously from 500
(Blumenson) to 271 (Ellis). British forces grossly overestimated the damage they
had inflicted, claiming over 100 tank kills on 18 July, and historians have uncritical-
ly accepted these inflated claims ever since. Blumenson, Breakout and Pursuit

es were shallower and therefore more vulnerable to carpet bombing. USAHD MS

61. German medics projected that 13.5 percent of wounded returned to their
units within a month, thus several thousand convalescents had returned to their
units by the eve of COBRA.
Loss figures included the lightly wounded, who either remained with their
units or who quickly returned to duty after treatment at theater dressing stations and
field hospitals, while replacement figures exclude at least 5,250 Waffen SS and para-
troop replacements, as well as personnel absorbed from field replacement battalions
(12,000), individually returning convalescents and personnel on leave (5,000), reas-
signed personnel, men returning from courses and schools, and returning sick. Thus
formations in Normandy had absorbed at least 28,000, and probably close to
40,000, replacements by COBRA.
63. For example, the LXXXIV Corps consolidated the shattered 77th and 91st
Divisions into Divisional Group König, and the 9th and 10th SS Panzer DiVISIOnS
amalgamated their panzergrenadier regiments into single reinforced regiments.

nies from Cherbourg that were deployed to the front in the Cotentin after 10 June.

assault guns, 41 tank hunters, and 114 heavy antitank guns. By 20 July it had lost
234 heavy antitank guns, 12 heavy flak guns, and 240 howitzers. NARA T-311 1,

By 14 July, the 6th Parachute Regiment had been reduced to 20 percent of
its authorized heavy weapons. On the eve of COBRA some 30,000 replacements
were on their way to the front-
-sufficient to bring German units back up to full
defensive strength. Allied air power thus played a decisive role in sapping German
strength. On 1 August, 42 percent of the tanks and assault guns committed (713 of
1,684) remained operational. PRO DEFE 3/61, Ultra Decrypt XL 3301, 24 July
