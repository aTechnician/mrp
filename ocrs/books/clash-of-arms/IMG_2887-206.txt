Simonds had ordered the 1st Division studies on Sicily and Ortona and
wanted weekly and daily operational studies in northwest Europe. He demanded
that "when opportunities occur, it is of great importance that troops should derive
the utmost benefit from periods out of contact,"
and emphasized three goals to be
sought during periods out of combat: morale enhancement, rehabilitation, and
retraining. NAC RG 24 12305, File 3/Reports /3,

Germany:
The Defeat of the Westheer
The Westheer tenaciously resisted in Normandy despite being greatly out-
numbered and outgunned. It remained cohesive and only cracked in August
after having sustained severe losses. This protracted defense reflected the
realism of German doctrine and training, the pronounced defensive advan-
tages of the terrain, and the limitations of Allied combat effectiveness. It
also reflected German military professionalism as the Westheer adapted and
innovated during the campaign to enhance its firepower, sustain its
strength, and minimize the effects of massive Allied superiority. Such adap-
tation clearly prolonged German resistance.
Yet while the German performance was impressive, the campaign
demonstrated that the Nazi war machine was not invincible or its soldiers
supermen. The campaign illuminated the steady decline of German combat
capabilities as attrition ground down the Nazi war machine and as its most
striking weaknesses poor strategy, logistics, intelligence, and interservice
cooperation- increasingly compromised the German defense. Profession-
alism, ideological indoctrination, quality training, excellent weaponry, and
extensive combat experience forged a powerful, cohesive, and disciplined
army, but these strengths ultimately were not enough to overcome marked
numerical and material inferiority. German combat excellence postponed
defeat, but the law of numbers prevailed. At the same time, distorting nazi
racial-ideological prejudices that denigrated American fighting qualines
the poor interservice coordination that nazism promoted, and the German
military's neglect of logistics and intelligence increasingly hampered
Derman operations. That the Westheer fought on for as long as it did
against growing odds in the face of mounting logistic problems and den-
ding intelligence testifies to its fighting prowess but underscores how dev-
astating was German neglect of logistics and intelligence.
The Westheer fought in Normandy under several major disadvantages.
Most significantly, Allied mastery of the air for the first time overturned the
traditional supremacy of land (emegnications over maritime communica
