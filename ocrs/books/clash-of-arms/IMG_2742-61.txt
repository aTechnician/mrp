12. McNair wrote, "The truth is sought regardless of whether pleasant or
unpleasant, or whether it supports or condemns our present organization and tac-
tics." Letter on "Antitank Defense," General McNair to CGS, 15 May 1941, quoted
in Greenfield, Organization, 44.

14. General McNair wrote, "Are these troops ready for war? It is my judge-
ment that, given complete equipment, they certainly could fight effectively. But it is
desired."
15. The army raised an experimental platoon in June 1940 that made its first
drop on 16 August 1940. In June 1941 only twelve transports were available for
parachute training, which restricted practice drops to company level. John Weeks,

Charles, 1988), 63-64.

18. Triangularity continued down through the division: each infantry regiment
had three battalions, each battalion three rifle companies, each company three rifle
platoons, and each platoon three squads. This provided at every level a fire element,
a maneuver element, and a reserve. Stanton, Order of Battle, 8.
19. "The ultimate objective of all military operations is the destruction of the
enemy's armed forces in battle." "Through offensive action a commander exercises,
his initiative, preserves his freedom of action, and imposes his will on the enemy,"
FM 100-5, Field Service Regulations, 1941, paras. 112 and 115.

23. During the war the eighty-nine American divisions raised absorbed 2.67
million replacements, thus on average each division received twice its original
establishment in replacements. Palmer, Procurement and Training, 177.
24. In 1942 the AGF received 40 percent of manpower but only 34 percent of
the highest rated (AGCT classes I-II) and 44 percent of the lowest rated troops
(AGCT IV, V). In March 1942 the distribution of U.S. Army manpower by AGCT
category was I-II: 34 percent, III: 31 percent, IV -V: 35 percent. In 1943 the respec-
tive totals were 30 percent, 33 percent, and 37 percent. During 1943 only 30.0 per-
cent of infantry recruits were rated AGCT I or II, compared to 31.5 percent in the

28. The first U.S. Army tank destroyer, the M3, which mounted a modified
1918-vintage 75mm field gun on an M2 half-track, went into production late in
1941. Christopher Gabel, Seek, Strike, and Destroy: The Evolution of American

29. The 75mm M5, for instance, married an antiaircraft gun with a light field
howitzer carriage. It was not until 1944 that the United States produced an effective
heavy antitank gun in the 90mm T8. Weeks, Men Against Tanks, 92-93.

38. The infantry-to-tank ratio in the 1940 German armored division was five
times that of the U.S. division and it too lacked infantry.

40. McNair hoped to attach independent armored infantry battalions to exist-
ing divisions once they went into combat, but the AGF deactivated all but one of
these battalions in 1943. Stanton, Order of Battle, 268-272.

43. By June 1944 less than half of army combat troops were organic to combat
divisions. Tank destroyer, artillery, mechanized cavalry, transport, antiaircraft,
bridging, signals, quartermaster, ordnance, and supply units were all pooled at army
level in accordance with the principle of flexibility.
