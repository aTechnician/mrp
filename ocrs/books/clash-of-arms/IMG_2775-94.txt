Montgomery, 136; Stephen Brooks, "Montgomery and the Preparations for OVER-
LORD," History Today (June 1984), 18-32.
190. Montgomery stated on 15 May 1944 that "we shall have to send the sol-
diers into battle seeing red. We must get them completely on their toes; having
absolute faith in the plan; and imbued with infectious optimism and offensive
eagerness. Nothing must stop them. If we send them into battle in this way-then
we will succeed." PRO CAB 44/264, 176.

Montgomery, Chaps. 1-4.
192. Carlo D'Este has argued that Montgomery intended an equal British
offensive role and that the strategy that did emerge was by default. But
Montgomery clearly enunciated a subordinate British role at OVERLORD planning
conferences. PRO AIR 37/784, Leigh-Mallory,

St Paul's School"; PRO WO 205/118, TEAG G(Plans), "Appreciation of the

193. Montgomery reiterated this strategy almost daily to his most trusted col-
Britain, 1939-1944: Toils and Troubles
leagues. See, for example, letter from Montgomery to Grigg, 2 July 1944, quoted in
194. PRO CAB 44/264, 29-30; Futter, The Funnies, passim.

198. That expansion took place at all was largely due to the staunch support of
Sir Alan Brooke. Fraser, Shock Them! 84-95.
199. Special Forces were the equivalent of six divisions when Britain fielded
only eighteen front-line infantry divisions. H. F. Joslen, Orders of Battle (London:
HMSO, 1960); Seymour, Special Forces, 26.
200. The most valuable commando raids were the destruction of the German
heavy-water production facilities in Norway that crippled their atomic weapons pro-
gram, and the March 1942 St. Nazaire raid that prevented the repair of German cap-
ital ships on France's Atlantic coast. Sir Brian Paget believed that "the operations
undertaken by the Commandos were largely a waste of effort, and could have been
better done by a unit of the field army." PRO, CAB 44/264, apdx. 2, 3; Brig. Peter
Young DSO MC, Commando (New York: Ballantine, 1969).
