5. Bradley contrasted the British and U.S. approaches as follows: "When
Montgomery prepared to attack he dragged up everything he had for an all out cam-
paign.... We Americans, on the other hand, constantly nibbled away at key posi-
tions of an enemy and sought to prevent him from entrenching himself in position.
We constantly kept him knocked off balance." Letter, Bradley to Eisenhower, 29
June 1944 quoted in Carlo D'Este, Decision in Normandy: The Unwritten Story of
Montgomery and the Allied Campaign (London: Collins, 1983), 340.
6. Montgomery recognized the drawbacks of the U.S. approach. He wrote that
"owing to continuous fighting without relief, the American troops rapidly tired;
man-management was bad, the infantry were very wet and tired, and some men did
not have a hot meal for four days running." And with his typical tactless conceit he
dismissed the U.S. approach as "futile doctrine." [WM BLM 78/1, "Notes on the
Campaign in North-West Europe," para. 11.
7. General Patch's U.S. Seventh Army, in its advance from southern France to
the German frontier during fall 1944, increasingly attacked on narrower frontages
and devised concentric envelopment tactics that allowed it to overcome strong
defenses with only marginal numerical and material superiority. Keith Bonn, When
the Odds Were Even: The Vosges Mountains Campaign (Novato, Calif.: Presidio
Press, 1994).
