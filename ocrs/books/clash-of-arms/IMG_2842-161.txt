had created serious shortages, which a major depot fire on 12 July and
heavy expenditures during the final battle for St. Lô had only made worse.
The shortages forced wider and more stringent ammunition rationing,
which meant that the First Army could not rely on its own firepower to
smash through the enemy during COBRA. 82
By mid-July, the First Army also faced a growing infantry shortage
because its forces had suffered heavy casualties in sustained combat.
Vigorous opposition, the defensive advantages of the hedgerow terrain, and
inexperience and poor coordination had combined to bring unexpectedly
heavy infantry losses during grim attritional warfare. Allied planners had
seriously underestimated the extent to which the campaign would be an
infantry slog, and as a result infantry losses had greatly exceeded available
replacements. 83 Riflemen suffered such casualties in the bocage that indi-
viduals' survival times averaged mere days.84 Such turnover eroded combat
effectiveness, and as a result, many infantry units had become badly deplet-
ed by mid-July.85 From a relative perspective, though, the U.S. infantry
position remained healthier than was the case for its allies and its enemy:
since the First Army's large replacement pool allowed it to sustain its strik-
ing power for longer than either its allies or the enemy could 86
At the same time, drawbacks of the U.S. replacement system increased
casualties and lowered combat effectiveness. The system met First Army
numerical needs, with the exception of infantry (see Table 7.4), but the
poor quality of replacements both increased casualties and the incidence of
combat exhaustion, thus undermining infantry performance. Assignment by
individual, lack of territorial or unit affinity between field and replacement
units, and direct induction into combat units engendered no esprit de corps
and poor morale among replacements. The system thus failed to sustain the
cohesion of field units that had to absorb many replacements. The weak-
nesses of the replacement system only aggravated the extremely high
turnover among riflemen during June and July, thus eroding infantry com-
bat effectiveness.87
The key advantage of the replacement system, though, was that it
could replace battle losses more flexibly and far faster than the enemy
could. Despite its serious flaws, the system suited the U.S. strategy of
applying continuous, massive force. As a result, the U.S. Army could
replenish units in the front line without having to withdraw them, which,
given the ninety-division ceiling, would have been difficult to achieve. The
mere replacement of numbers, however, could not immediately restore unit
fighting power, because such qualitative factors as cohesion and morale
were as important as numbers. 88
Lack of infantry and munitions meant that the First Army could not
rely on raw fighting power to smash through enemy defenses south of St.
Lô and thrust into Brittany. Although the fall of St. Lô had finally brought
the First Army into more open terrain west of the city and inflicted heavy

casualties on the Germans, the enemy defenses remained intact. Indeed,
despite heavy losses, the Germans had steadily reinforced their strength on
the St. Lô front and still held strong positions on high ground south of the
city. 89
Once again U.S. operational flexibility played a major role in the suc-
cess of COBRA. Short on infantry and ammunition and facing intact
defenses, the First Army recognized that it could not break through with the
conventional broad-front attacks advocated by doctrine. It had learned from
the grueling fight for St. Lô that it had to launch a highly concentrated
offensive to penetrate the enemy front. General Bradley thus devised an
original plan that could succeed despite prevailing attack doctrine, ammu-
nition shortages, and shrinking infantry strength.
The COBRA plan was innovative in several key respects. To provide
the firepower it lacked, the U.S. First Army relied heavily on carpet bomb-
ing to smash a hole in the German front, on a narrow-front offensive to
penetrate the German line, and on mobility and speed to outmaneuver,
rather than outfight, the enemy and achieve a breakthrough. The First Army
thus planned COBRA as a concentrated break-in attack by three infantry
divisions on a narrow front, supported by intense air and artillery attack, to
secure the flanks while three mechanized divisions punched through to the
rear, swung southwest, captured Coutances and cut off the German
LXXXIV Corps on the Atlantic coast. 90
