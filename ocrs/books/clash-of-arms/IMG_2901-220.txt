daily losses fell from 2,500 to 2,250 despite steadily mounting Allied strength.

blasted it and wrecked its communications. It had to be withdrawn and rehabilitat-
ed, and it resumed operations in Normandy only in July.

26. The ineffectiveness of German artillery in Normandy has led historians
mistakenly to conclude that the Germans did not employ much army artillery in
Normandy. In fact, at least twenty-eight army artillery battalions fought in the cam-
paign. NARA T-312, 1565, 0001122, AOK 7 Stoart/la, "Befehl für Einsatz v.

27. So skillful was German camouflage that Allies experienced great difficulty
in locating and neutralizing German guns. Up to 24 June, neither the 12th SS
Panzer Division nor the Panzer Lehr Division had lost an artillery piece. NARA T-

28. "Shoot-and-scoot" tactics involved short full-battery barrages followed by
displacement to new positions. Sprinkling fire was random battery firing to hinder
detection, and roving fire was continuous fire from a single detached gun.

30. On the relatively few occasions when artillery provided effective fire sup-
port, as it did, for example, before Montebourg in mid-June, it slowed the Allied
advance. The heaviest fire provided was on 3 July against the British airborne
bridgehead when 1,826 barrels fired 4,500 rounds. Carell, Invasion, 182-185;

31. Mortars inflicted 70 percent of Allied casualties in Normandy. Particularly
deadly was the 120mm heavy mortar, which, fortunately for the Allies, remained

included two of only five heavy regiments in existence.
