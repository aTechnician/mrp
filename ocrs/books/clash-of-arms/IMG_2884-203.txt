31. The Canadians claimed twenty enemy tanks destroyed. Stacey, Victory,
161. The 3d Division casualties totaled 1,194. Stacey, Victory, 163.
32. This experience clearly illuminates that Canadian expertise in urban war-
fare gained in Italy was not disseminated to Canadian forces preparing for OVER-
LORD in Britain. Wilson, "Tank-Infantry Cooperation Doctrine," 78-81.

The SSR had 208 casualties. NAC RG 24 14116, WD GS 6 CIB, 20 July
43. Officers and military police had to force the fleeing Essex Scottish back
into the line at gunpoint. The battalion's 210 casualties and 50 percent loss of Bren
guns illuminates the extent of the rout. Roy, 1944, 95.
44. Total Canadian casualties were 1,965. NAC RG 24 13711, IICC Int. Sum.
45. Canadian intelligence correctly appraised that the German front line was
thinly held by the 16th Luftwaffe Field and 272d Infantry Divisions, but failed to
identify the Ist SS Panzer Regiment with its nearly 100 tanks in reserve south of
Caen. NAC RG24 13711, IICC Int. Sum. 10, 20 July 1944.

52. The Canadians both failed to note the arrival of the 2d and 9th SS Panzer
Divisions and to appreciate the extent of mine workings that the Germans utilized to
infiltrate the Canadian rear. NARA T-313, 420, KTB PzGr. West, 21-25 July 1944;

53. B Squadron, the Fort Garry Horse, lost eleven tanks and the North Nova
Scotia Highlanders suffered 139 casualties. NAC RG 24 14234, WD 10 CAR, 25
July 1944; 15122, WD NNSH, 25-26 July 1944.
54. The infantry advance was only supported by one troop of 17-pounder anti-
tank guns, which forced back some German armor.
56. Only eighteen survivors of C Company, Royal Regiment of Canada, made
it back to their own lines.
57. The two lead companies took 307 casualties, and only twenty-four sur-
vivors escaped back to their own lines. The battalion, in fact, took heavier casualties
than the Newfoundland Regiment had suffered during the first day of the Somme on
1 July 1916. Reginald Roy, "Black Day for the Black Watch," Canadian Defence
Quarterly 3 (Winter 1982-1983), 34-42.
58. Pockets of Canadians still holding out in front prevented artillery fire sup-
port. Foulkes had thrown good in after bad and was prepared to commit the entire
6th Brigade if necessary to reach his objectives.
59. Accurate loss figures for SPRING are impossible to determine because
reporting channels became so clogged that many casualties suffered on 25 July were
only reported on following days. The official 25 July total was 1,202, but the real
total was nearer 1,500. Stacey, Victory, 194.
60. As early as 22 July, Panzer Group West had reinforced its positions south
of Caen in expectation of a renewed attack. NARA T-313, 420, KTB 5. Pz. AOK, 22
July 1944. For intelligence gaps, see PRO WO 171/131, TFAG Int. Sum. 149, 25
61. Only 25 percent of the planes bombed their targets. A second attack on the
morning of 25 July, which targeted suspected German reserves, brought no assis-
tance to the already stalled ground attack. Stacey, Victory, 188-189.
62. During SPRING Ii Canadian Corps claimed only eleven armored fighting
vehicle kills and did not take a single prisoner. PRO WO 171/454, 7th Armd. Div.
Int. Sum. 47, 27 July 1944; PRO WO 219/1449, "Daily POW Reports."
63. The official Canadian history claims that SPRING helped purchase a 48-
hour delay in the transfer of German reserves to the U.S. sector during COBRA.
The 9th S$ Panzer Division did replace the exhausted 272d Division, but the latter
in turn relieved the 2Ist Panzer Division. Neither the 2d nor 116th Panzer Divisions
were drawn into line, and both formations were redeployed against the Americans

66. The 3d Division had Suffered over 5,000 casualties by 25 July assrost
much of its original cadre. The numerous undertrained replacements it absorben
needed time to acclimate, gain experience, and forge esprit de corps. The Canadian
Scottish Regiment had suffered 100 percent turnover and remained 34 percent
Siderstrength on 27 July, and the incidence of battle fatigue had tripled in July.
Simonds's dissatisfaction with the division's performance led to the removal of a
prigadier and two battalion commanders. NAC RG 24 Crerar Papers (hereafter CP)
