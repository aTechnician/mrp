Principles: The Disciplines of War
Logistics the stuff that if you don't have enough of, the war will not be won as soon
General Nathaniel Green, when asked by George Washington to accept the
post of the Quartermaster General of the American Army, is reputed to have said,
'Whoever heard of a Quartermaster in history as such'.
Thorpe in his book Pure Logistics propounds the view that 'the
conclusion is irresistible that the military themselves know next to

gain the reader's attention and to make him more receptive for the
message which he puts across so lucidly. And yet, using the word
'know' in the sense, 'personally acquainted with', and as an American
writing for the United States forces before his country entered the First

experienced military, certainly the successful, know about, are all too
well personally acquainted with, logistics. Although Napoleon may
have said 'qu'on ne me parle pas des vivres' (let no one speak to me of
provisions'), he not only reorganised the logistic system of the French
Army, but usually planned his campaigns so that they were logistically
possible. His logistic system failed only twice; in Spain, where he was in
command in person for a very short time, and in Russia in 1812 where
his army had outgrown his staff system.
