Notes:
(a) The discrepancy is possibly explained by most Israeli flights being routed from
Eastern U.S.A.
(b) As an indication of the lift provided by purpose-built transport aircraft, the 145
C-5s produced twice as much tonne/kilometres as the 140 Israeli civil airliners. A
lonne/ Kilometre is a means of expressing the ability of any movement resource,
truck, train, etc. to lift one tonne (2,000 lbs) over one kilometre.

Van Creveld, Command in War, p. 30, and in conversation with the author. This
accords with Herzog's observation, War of Atonement, p. 279, that there was a lack
of administrative discipline in the Israeli Army. Van Creveld says that, in an
attempt to get the logistic system right in the Lebanon invasion of 1982, the Israelis
over-corrected, to the extent that the narrow roads were clogged with ammunition
vehicles to the detriment of follow-up units trying to get forward to maintain tel
nomentum of the advance. This was one, but not the sole, reason for the Israeli
failure in Lebanon to secure all their objectives before the cease-fire could be
imposed.

pp. 59 and 154. No denigration of the Mukti Bahini is intended here, some of their
operations were very successful. Palit quotes some examples; at Belonia, 450
Pakistani troops were killed in a battle in which the Bahini lost 70 dead.
Eventually, the Pakistanis had to deploy a whole brigade to clear the area. Near
Satkhira the Pakistanis lost 300 soldiers against guerrilla losses of about 20.

thousand minor bridges and culverts were blown up.

Because of the tasks given to Major General
Lachman Singh, commanding 20th Mountain Division, who comes across as a
highly competent divisional commander, he was reinforced to an overall strength
of 30,000 men. Corps Heaquarters allotted him 300 3-ton military vehicles and 300
civllan vehicles.
Because of breakdowns.
mechanical difficulties,
malingering" by some
civilian drivers and owners, the average civilian vehicles available to us were
not more than 150 on any day. Civilian transport posed us a lot of other
problems also. It was not easy to get spare parts for necessary repairs for the
multitude of varieties of vehicles in the forward areas... Some of our

mechanics were not trained to repair the different varieties of transport. Most
of the civilian transport was not fit for movement on kacha (rough,
rudimentary) tracks.'
Singh gave priority to gun and tank ammunition, and to mortar bombs and
machine gun ammunition. He found that small arms ammunition expenditure was
low. Not surprisingly in a fast moving battle, fuel expenditure was high, and gun
ammunition was not particularly high (between 2,500 and 3,000 rounds per
battle).
10. Military Balance 1989-1990, pp. 158-160. At present India has 33 divisions and 14
independent brigades,
including, among other equipments, 3,150 Main Battle
Tanks, 1,150 APCs (700 MICV, and 450 APCs), 130 SP guns (80 x Abbot and
50 x 130 mm), and 442 helicopters (280 army and 152 air force). No figures are
given for load carriers, and it would be interesting to see if the increase in teeth' in
the Indian Army has been matched by an equivalent increase in 'tail. The author's
guess would be to say that it has not. However, the Indians have clearly learned the
value of amphibious forces, because they now have one regiment of marines (1,000
strong), with another forming (p. 160).

9. Some assault packs (a complete 30 days' WMR for a unit group constitutes one
assault pack) were loaded complete into one ship (RFAs). On other occasions,
mainly in the case of the LSLs and the STUFT, loads were stowed where there was
space. MV Elk had all the ammunition (698 tons) from three assault packs, and
some 4,800 anti-tank mines. These and a large quantity of defence stores, barbed
wirs, sand-bags and metal pickets,
, were stowed in one vast pile in Elk's lower
vehicle deck. She was effectively a floating bomb. See Note 18 below.

Under the naval task organisation system the Task Force (TF) is given a number,
in this case 317, so Fieldhouse was Commander Task Force (CTF) 317.
Task
Groups (TG) are allocated a number after a decimal point, for example TG 317.1,
and the commander is CTG 317.1. Below Task Group, is Task Unit (TU), which
are numbered with two decimal points,
TU 317.1.1, and the commander is
CTU 37.1.1.
