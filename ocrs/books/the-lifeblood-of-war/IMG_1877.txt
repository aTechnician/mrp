D NATO Frigate Replacement for the 1990s
As Major General Baxter, a recent British Assistant Chief of Defence Staff
(Logistics), pointed out at the MOD/King's College seminar in July 1989, within
NATO there are five different tanks with four guns of different calibres, and four
different anti-tank helicopters with different missiles. The brief success with a
common small arms round ended when 7.62 mm ceased to be the NATO standard
calibre. Eleven firms in Alliance countries build anti-tank weapons, eighteen firms
n seven countries design and produce ground-to-air weapons, and sixteen
companies in seven countries work on air-to-ground weapons
14. The flexibility of airborne forces equipped with the FLA Tactran and a mix of the
present and next generation of helicopters can be briefly shown if we postulate the
following scenario:
(a) A brigade to be flown 2,350 nautical miles from the U.K. (to Western
Turkey for example), which we will call Airlift 1.
(b) Three days later a need arises for a rapid reinforcement of the mainland of
Europe.
The first phase of this reinforcement includes the insertion of an
airborne force from U.K. at a radius of action of 800 nautical miles, to seize an
airstrip which is held by heliborne forces of an advancing enemy army,
designated Airlift 2.
(c) Concurrently with Airlift 1, stocks need to be flown from the United
Kingdom to Europe at a radius of action of 400 nautical miles, designated
Airlift 3.
Airlift 1
For the purposes of this scenario, the brigade in this move is not configured as
