The Lifeblood of War
defensive positions within the Delta. His plan was to build a fortified line (the de
Lattre Line), around the perimeter of the Delta, and increase pacification
operations within the enclosed area. He proposed turning over the static defence
duties to the Vietnamese National Army under the Emperor, Bao Dai. In step with
this, he aimed to increase military aid from the United States. The de Lattre Line
ran from the sea north of Haiphong, west to Viet Tri, and then south-east to the sea
near Phat Diem. It enclosed a salient about 75 miles wide where it rested on the
sea, about 15 miles wide at its narrowest around Viet Tri, and about 110 miles
long. Its defence consisted of small, mutually supporting fortified infantry
positions. By mid-summer 1951, 600 posts had been completed, and a further 600
ov the end of that vear.

In the end, the overall concept never worked properly because it depended on
manpower (over two infantry divisions worth of men) and successfully pacifying
the area. Unfortunately the Vietnamese Army was never effective.
14. Davidson, p. 124, gives the rationale for these timings.

Spector, Advice 42- Sy. Pase 14 quotes the record of the meeting on 20
September 1951 with de Lattre saying:
If you lose Korea, Asia is not lost; but if I lose Indochina, Asia is lost. Tonkin
is the key to Southeast Asia, if Southeast Asia is lost, India will "burn like a
match' and there will be no barrier to the advance of communism before Suez
and Africa. If the Moslem world were thus engulfed, the Moslems in North
Africa would soon fall in line and Europe itself would be outflanked?
This was a somewhat extreme version of the Domino Theory, even by the
standards of the time! Although, according to Spector, p. 144,
*the American leaders were willing to accept the de Lattre concept of one war,
they were unenthusiastic about taking any practical steps toward establishing
a unified Franco-American war effort in the Far East'.
17. Spector, p. 145; only 444 jeeps out of 968 and 393 6x6 trucks out of 906 were
delivered in the summer of 1951. See p. 153 for maintenance standards.
18. Spector, p. 148; and p. 118 where he gives the example of Brigadier General Brink,
Commander USMAAG, flying to U.S. Far East Command headquarters in
Tokyo to obtain critical supplies for the French during the Vinh Yen battle in
January 1951. Again, in June of that year, when the French ran dangerously short
of 105 mm gun ammunition during the Phat Diem battle during Giap's Day River
offensive, Brink arranged for the French to draw ammunition directly from the
stockpiles of the U.S. Far East Command.
19. Fall, Street Without Joy, p. 94, gives the figures as 2 Soviet Molotava trucks, a U.S.
Jeep, 150 tons of ammunition, 500 rifles, 100 sub-machine guns, 22 machine guns,
30 Browning automatic rifles, 40 light mortars, 14 medium mortars, 2 heavy
120 mm mortars, 23 bazookas, and 3 recoilless anti-tank guns. Davidson gives
higher figures which are the same as those given in the footnote to Fall p. 94, where
he is quoting Captain Marion of the French Army. But neither figure constitutes a
haul worth the effort expended by the French. What was significant, and a portent
for the future was the Soviet trucks, as Fall says, positive proof that the Soviet bloc
was starting to pour equipment into Northern Vietnam. By 1954, nearly 800
Molotavas would have been delivered to the Vietminh, a vital factor in the battle
that decided the outcome of the War. These trucks were of a better design for the
terrain than the American models used by the French. Trucks, artillery pieces, and
other equipment supplied by the Soviets, steadily closed the technological gap
between the French and the Vietminh.

21. These were not from the ineffective Vietnamese National Army, but colonial
troops, Vietnamese commanded by Frenchmen. They were excellent soldiers who
fought well, on the whole.
22. In 1954, even the most modern helicopters were not capable of moving large
numbers of men, over the sort of distances involved in the fighting in Indochina.
Neither did they have even a medium lift capability, let alone a heavy lift. Not until
the next generation of helicopters came into service was there any prospect of air-
mobile operations.
23. Davidson, p. 218, quoting JCS Study, The Khe Sanh Study, Annex B, p. 4 and
MACV Study of the Comparisons Between the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the
Analagous Khe San Situation, March 1968, comes to a figure of 60-70 aireraft, but
the author has chosen to apply the 75 per cent serviceability rate. Hence his lower
figure is less than Davidson's.
24. At the battle of Arnhem, the air force delivered to 1st British Airborne Division
over a period of eight days, 1,431 tons of supplies in 601 sorties; 84 aircraft were
shot down, only 106 tons were collected.

28. Spector, pp. 258/259. For example, in the central maintenance depot near Saigon,
thousands of tons of equipment lay scattered in disorder over thirty-two acres of
open fields, where it was subject to the ravages of the humid South East Asian
climate in which deterioration set in very rapidly.
29. Spector, pp. 285/286, in 1956 the Quang Trung basic training centre was capable of
handling over 9,000 recruits at a time in a sixteen week course, and there was an
eight week course for reservists.
An American adviser reported that:
'One day during practice firing the 60 mm mortar, I was rather appalled at the
lack of organisation of the class. For example there would be ladies, in their
large straw conical hats, out selling bowls of soup and other things to nibble
on right in among the class ...
that type of thing.
• When the Vietnamese
officer in charge was challenged by the American adviser on this and other
slack habits, and asked which was better, the way he carried out the
instruction or the way he had seen at Fort Benning, from where he had just
returned, he replied, 'Oh, it was much better at Fort Benning? On being asked
why, he said, 'Well sir, that was Fort Benning and this is Vietnam?

Fixed wing
transport lifted 780,000 tons. In 1968, the figures were 1,123,032 tons by helicopter
and 997,174 tons by fixed wing aircraft.
34. Cochran, First Strike at the River Drang, p. 50 quotes Kinnard giving helicopter
losses during his time in command of Ist Air Cavalry Division. His helicopters flew
over 161,000 combat hours (400,000 individual sorties), and one helicopter was hit
ver 274 hours, one shot down per
4,500 hours, one hit and destroyed per
11,500 hours, one crew member killed per 6,000 hours, one wounded per
1,200 hours. Over 60 per cent of all helicopters shot down were recovered and
repaired.
Author's comment: These figures demonstrate what a friendly air environment
the U.S. forces operated in over South Vietnam. There was also no threat from
