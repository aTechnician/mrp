try to ht incoming
tions. Decision makers misperceive events when they
information into their existing theories and images, particularly when the latter
play a large part in determining what is expected. Under these circumstances,
really is screened and the person percelves
what he expects.
Thus, most
misperceptions, though not all, may
be deined as instances of cognitive
dissonance. Dissonance of cognition takes place, according to Leon Festinger, in
his work A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, when behaviour is incompatible with a
person's values. Misperception then becomes a cognitive process misrepresenting
the current state of affairs and moulding events according to personal cognition.
Reality is misrepresented in order to adapt those events to the person's cognitive
map.

the nation's resources are stretched to breaking point

on p. 34, Israel maintains '550 first line aircraft and more tanks than Britain and
France put together'. This state of affairs persists today— see The Military Balance

spent 40 per cent of GNP on defence.

• there were never more than 600 soldiers on the Canal itself, and the
number had been reduced to about 450 on 6 October 1973, as a result of an
apparent lull in the fighting along the Canal. These were from a reserve
(JERUSALEM) Brigade, and spread through 20 forts overlooking the watel.
In fact there seems to have been very little attempt to think through exactly
what the Bar Lev Line could achieve in a situation on a major crossing of the
Canal by the Egyptians in open war. It was probably too weak to prevent a
determined attempt to force a crossing, and could only hope to direct artillery
fire. The quite widely separated fortifications were easily masked by smoke
and neutralised by Egyptian artillery. Had all the supporting tanks reached
their prepared positions (many moved too late and were caught on the move
by the first waves of Egyptian anti-tank crews), they would have brought
considerable fire-power to bear on the obstacle, but it is difficult to see how 20
men every miles, even with
armoured support, could altogether upset
#gyptian plans. No provision was made to evacuate the posts which had
identified aggression and were about to be over-run. They remained a source
of embarrassment for many days, diverting forces to their relief, and confusing
the higher echelons of command... the israelis-
failed to think through the role of the posts in a war.

13. The Military Balance 1989-1990, pp. 78-82 and 102-104. For example, at present,
the United Kingdom, at full mobilisation (which has not occurred since the Second
World War) would put 1.12 per cent of her population into uniform (from a
population of 57,013,000, the total armed forces mobilised numbers 636,650,
consisting of 311,650 active list and 325,800 reservists). The Israeli Defence Force
on full mobilisation consists of 645,000 men and women, which out of a population
of 4,542,000 represents 14.20 per cent.

'Rising abruptly from the east edge of the Canal was a high embankment
along the entire east bank, southward from Kantara. This was based upon
nearly a century of Canal dredging residue, which had been made higher and
wider by the Israelis... In the first place this was to conceal Israeli
movements just east of the Canal. Second, its 45 degree slope from the water
ensured that no amphibious vehicle could possibly climb it. See also diagrams
in Shazly, pp. 208-9.

Adan.

17. Shazly, pp. 170-174, not everyone was deceived, according to Shazly. He says that
he recognised the attack for what it was, and wanted to withdraw armour and anti-
tank missiles from the East Bank to pinch off the Israeli lodgement. He was over-
ruled by Sadat and Ismail. The piecemeal attacks by the Egyptian Army that
followed were, according to Shazly, the inevitable outcome of Sadat's decision.
18. Heikal, The Road to Ramadan, p. 220, claims that the Egyptians were deceived for
up to four days.

20. This farm had been built before the 1967 war by a Japanese agricultural mission to
Egypt, and abandoned when the Israelis overran the Sinai. The Israelis mistook
the inscriptions on the walls for Chinese, hence the name.
21. Shazly, pp. 173-175, argued against
25 Armoured Brigade attacking in this
manner, and forecast its destruction. Whether or not this is hindsight on his part is
difficult to say. In his book, he says that Adan sprung the trap with three armoured
brigades, whereas he actually used two.
22. Sellers, p. 4, unkindly describes this bridge as a 'typical sapper folly'.
23. Magan replaced Mendler, the original commander, who had fought the holding
action on the Sinai front on the first day of the war. Mendler was killed on 13
October.
24. Shazly, p. 191, claims that 3rd Army needed 150 tons of supplies per day to stay
alive'. This is a very low figure for an army in contact, and one wonders what he
means by
'stay alive'. The incomparably more efficient German Army in 1944
needed 200 tons per day per division when in contact; American and British
divisions considerably more (700 tons per day). The Egyptian 3rd Army consisted
of eight infantry brigades, one armoured brigade, and ten tank battalions, the
equivalent of three or four divisions.
