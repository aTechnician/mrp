Glossary of Terms and Acronyms
Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel. In the British
service a landing
craft capable
carrying
an
intantry platoon (30 men), or a landrover and trailer.
There are different designs of LCVP in the Dutch
and United States Navies.
A United States Army Air Force bomber of the
Second World War. Also in service with the British
Royal Air Force. Very under-powered for a bomber.
Sometimes used as a transport aircraft and to tow
gliders.
Landing Platform Dock, two in the Royal Navy,
considerably more in the US Navy. An amphibious
ship fitted with a dock aft, accessed by a tail-gate. By
flooding ballast tanks, and opening the tail-gate,
craft can enter and leave, loading and unloading at a
ramp at the forward end of the dock. This is a big
advantage, and quantum step forward from driving
vehicles off roll-on-roll-off (ro-ro) ferries
on to
pontoons, or lowering trucks and other loads over
the side by crane, particularly in a seaway. In the
British service, each LPD has the command and
control facilities for an amphibious and landing
force task group commander to exercise joint
command.
Landing Ship Logistic, RFA (see below) roll-on-
roll-off ships designed to carry tanks, trucks and
logistic supplies for an amphibious operation. Can
carry an assembled Mexeflote (see below) on each
side, or in pieces on deck. Can land a helicopter
amidships if the crane is stowed. Has a one-spot
helipad on the stern.
Landing Ship Tank, designed during the Second
World
War for
amphibious
operations,
and
produced in large numbers in the United States.
Could take about 50 trucks, depending on the size of
vehicle, or about 8 main battle tanks. Had bow
doors and a ramp. Had a flat bottom and shallow
draught, and could beach, and even dry-out on a
falling tide, to be re-floated on the next rising tide.
Very robust, but rolled in a 'heavy dew'. Remained in
service with the British Services until the mid 1960s.

and protection to enable it to play a leading role in
operations in

Abrams M1-A, Soviet T80, Israeli Merkava II and
the British Challenger. Its long-term future in the
order of battle is a matter for controversy.
