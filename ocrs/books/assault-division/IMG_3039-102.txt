ASSAULT DIVISION
Force. They felt bloody, but on the whole unbowed. 8 Brigade
had lost all three Commanding Officers,
and, on the average
battalions lost three Company Commanders each.
So it was
with 185 Brigade :
the Norfolks lost four and the Warwicks
three of their Rifle Company Commanders.
But the survivors
addressed themselves to their duties and carried on : 185 Brigade
reorganising, resting
and training for a week, while the other
two brigades held the line and started sending out patrols east
towards the river.
The Division's connections with Overlool
and Venraij were by no means ended,
though when Venrai
was taken the most unpleasant chapter in their history was over.
Chapter Seven
WINTER: THE MAAS RIVER LINE
Discover the soldier
Here by the inundations of the Maas,
At one with nature and at variance
With the elements
That ever since one grey, immortal dawn
On the blazing Calvados coast
Have belaboured constantly
The fighting men.
War has suspended
Even the cultivation of the soil :
Cows are not milked nor sluices attended—
The Stygian Maas
And the cold beeks have left their appointed course.
Here you can see despair,
The glimmering waste of years,
Sense the frustration.
The pines are silent,
Deserted the excavations among the dunes,
Trappings and traces of the unnatural Germans
In lonely mist.
Only the quiet nook in the shell-splintered wood
Restores the sweet sense of rest
Where men were gently laid
Beneath the earth.
The wearied sentry
Sees only the devastation of the day
The puppy that survived, and licked his hand
And won his heart
So long deprived of affection: stares at the blackness
Over the evil river ;
Recovering, remembers
Another country.
