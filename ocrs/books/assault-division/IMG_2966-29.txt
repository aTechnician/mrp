PREPARATION
The main enemy strength, which totalled ten Panzer Divisions
and forty-nine Infantry Divisions, was known to lie in wait in
the Pas de Calais area—on the left flank of the Invasion! It
was common knowledge after the Dieppe raid that all ports, even
minor ones, were most heavily defended-that was why it had
been decided to rely on maintenance across beaches, and to con-
struct the Mulberries: of all the ports in the actual landing areas
Caen and Ouistreham were the largest. The Le Havre promon-
tory, with its massive coastal defence works, lay to the left rear of
the bridgehead, and commanded directly the approaches and
beaches across the Seine Bay, the prospective Sword Sector.
Finally, waiting
in the bridgehead area were five Infantry
Divisions along the coast and two Infantry Divisions behind the
coastal defences in the Cherbourg Peninsula: immediate reserves
for the Normandy area were the I2th SS Panzer Division, away
to the left at Lisieux, and the zist Panzer Division, which was
prowling round Caen. " Task for 3 Brit Inf Div to secure the
high ground NORTH of CAEN and, if possible, CAEN itself;
to relieve 6 Airborne Div on the bridges over the CANAL

The great body of the Division was unaware of the decisions
that so closely affected its destiny.
It was to be the extreme left
flank, they heard.
Where though? Norway? Holland? Pas
de Calais? The popular bet was France.
Cheerfully, but with
an important question-mark persisting in mind, everyone made
ready for Leapyear, the last of the great exercises in the north.
Leapyear was a success and very encouraging.
Unit prepara-
tions were completed, and on the night 27-28 March loading
was ordered to proceed from the floodlit yards at Chanonry.
morning everyone was aboard. The flotillas formed up and in
afternoon set sail up the Firth to the north-east for
Lybster and Wick.
Off Lybster the going was very bad, and
waves were breaking over the bows of L.G T.
The course south
for Burghead began on time, but on the morning of the
when the time came for the run-in from the Lowering Position,
it was decided to sail into Cromarty Firth for shelter.
The weather
was extremely rough and looked like deteriorating.
