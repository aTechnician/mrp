We will discuss the use of different types of
projectile and fuze in Chapter 8.
Several versions of the 25-pounder were in-
troduced during the war. The latest was Mark
III, which had a slightly modified box-trail and
firing platform. It was also equipped for the first
time with a muzzle brake. A lighter version was
developed for use in hilly terrain in Burma - the
Jury axle 25-pounder. The distance between the
wheels, which were smaller, had been reduced
and thus also the firing platform. The shield
could also be removed for lower gun weight
during transport. One example of this version
could be seen at the Royal Aruillery Museum,
Woolwich Arsenal (Fig. 4-3).
The gun detachment normally comprised
six gunners led by a Sergeant. During long
battles it was possible to manage firing by using
three to four men only. Hence, working in shifts
was possible to arrange. A pre-requisite was that
sufficient volumes of ammunition had been
stocked up at the gun site before the battle. In
some battles as much as 500-600 projectiles
were stockpiled.
Mobilisation of industry
The manufacturing of the 25-pounder started in
1939 bi
Roval Ordnance Factory
(ROF
Woolwich and by the private company Vickers
Armstrong. In the middle of 1930s there still
were three government-owned factories
operation and another three 'moth-balled'. The
industrial production could therefore gear up as
Table 4-1 illustrates. 67
Of the various industries, five were desig-
nated as manufacturers of 25-pounders, or more
specifically, the most demanding parts of the
gun, the barrel and the breech. They also were
responsible for final assembly of the guns after
carriages and other parts had been delivered to

barrels manufactured by the different industries
is presented in Table 4-2.

Besides Vickers Armstrong another five private
industries were engaged late 1940 and early
1941 for manufacture of barrels as presented in
Table 4-3.

Manufacture of carriages with buffer/recu-
perator, wheels, platform and trail was a suitable
task for private industries. Five industrial groups
had to be established in order to meet the re-
quirements. Many sub-contractors had to be
engaged as well. The leaders of the groups were
companies manufacturing barrels and breeches.
All the groups cooperated closelv and with the
Royal Ordnance factories in order to meet
delivery time obligations, not the least this coop-
cration was necessary as regards supply of raw
materials and components. The five groups were
normally responsible
for final assembly of
complete guns.
For manufacture of carriages five groups
were also established including sub-contractors.
The leading private companies were to deliver

The G. & J. Weir Company was contracted
already in May 1939 and, as seen in Table 4-4,
they were to manufacture and assemble the
largest number of guns. Fig. 4-4 is a good illus-
tration from their workshops. Note that women
dominate the workforce. In total 12,500 barrels
were manufactured by British industry and
10,222 carriages. The first number is often in the
literature presented as the number of 25-
pounders manufactured, but as we see from the
second number, the lower number is a more
correct number of complete guns manufactured.
To this number, however, a number of self-
propelled guns
(Sextons) manufactured in
Canada can be added.
The overall planning had the target of 350
guns per month manufactured. This was accom-
plished, but not until mid-1941, i.e. two years
after the redirection of the industry had taken
place. The accumulated number of delivered
barrels and carriages over time is presented in
Fig. 4-5. At the end of 1939, 189 barrels with
breeches had been delivered, but deliveries of
carriages did not take place until March 1940,
when the first eight could be delivered from
Vickers Armstrong. In April they could deliver
another sixteen carriages, and G. & J. Weir could
deliver the first five of their manufacture. Man-
ufacture then increased rapidly, but at the end of
1940 only 1,356 carriages had been delivered, so
the Army requirement could not yet be filled. so
was to take another two years before that target
was met. When this had taken place around the
end of 1942, the industry could be directed
