EPIlOGUE
launching any artillery programme.
Should a large number of 155-mm howitzers
prove to become the preferred option, where
shall we get them? Are they stored from the Cold
War, or must they be manufactured? The latter
case implies certain problems. Most likely there
will exist only a few factories in the western world
that can manufacture 155-mm barrels. And
should we decide to acquire a large number due
to the threat we see internationally, many other
countries will most likely do the same. This would
certainly imply that 'buying from the shelf' will
prove very difficult, not to say impossible. Hence,
we have to be prepared to re-create our own arms
industries. This will be possible but before it can
commence, much time will be needed for
arriving at decisions on necessary funding prior-
ities. I am not sure that short range artillery and
a great number of barrels will be the preferred
priority, more likely it will be fewer guns with
long range capability firing smart precision am-
munition. I am with this not arguing against
artillery capability to fire against area targets. This
capability must be retained too.
Before such a situation as discussed above
will emerge the general trend will thus be to
further develop weapons for extended ranges
and improved precision. The 'stand-off capabil-
ity' will be the future, as it looks just now. And,
quite frankly, hitting valuable targets far beyond
our manoeuvring forces is what artillery always
has done since it was first introduced.
With these interesting reflections about the
future our discussion ended.
