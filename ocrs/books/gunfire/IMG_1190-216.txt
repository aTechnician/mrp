Howitzer and had been developed for use
by glider-borne formations. The design of
several existing guns were used. The
barrel was for instance a shorter version
of the barrel of the standard 105mm field
howitzer and the buffer/recuperator from
the 75mm pack howitzer. The intention
was to get a gun with a stronger shell than
the HE shell of the latter. As the weight
must be kept down to just over a ton, the
price became a short barrel and thus
shorter range. The maximum range was
around 7.6km as compared with 8.9km
of the 75mm gun. The number of guns in
the operation is found in the report Allied
Airborne Operations in Holland.
September-October 1944, which probably
was prepared by the divisional
headquarters of 1 British Airborne
Division. The report is included in Walch
archive (IWM 01/11/2)
375 In the Corps' plan for the march it was
prescribed that the vehicle density should
be 35 vehicles per mile, i.e. 50 yards
between the vehicles (WO 171/341). The
divisional column would then be spread
over a distance of some 160km. In the
order for Guards Division it was,
however, stated that the density should be
60 vehicles to the mile, i.e. only 30 vards
between vehicles. If so, the divisional
column would cover 98km (WO
171/380).
376
Many sources show the design of the
barrage, e.g. war diaries of the
participating field regiments. It is also
presented in the report Operation Market
Garden 17-26 September 1944 prepared
by XXX Corps headquarters (IWM
Walch Papers 01/11/1-2).
377 The layout is confirmed by a pencil note
on the issue of the fire plan attached to
the war diary of 94 Field Regiment RA
(WO 171/983).
378
The fire plan shows in detail how the
shifts are to take place all the way to the
final line target u-u, where all regiments
remain firing during the last minute. The
plan is attached to the war diary of most
of the participating field regiments.
379
The fire plan was prepared by the
artillery headquarters of Guards Division
and is attached to war diaries of several of
the participating regiments, e.g. 7
Medium Regiment RA (WO 171/1047).
It can be assumed that 'Z' hours was the
same for both barrages, but it is amazing
that this is not mentioned in the plan.
380 Margry (2002), Volume 1, pp. 90-92 have
the details of these attacks and their results.

The second time a complete regiment was
transported to the battlefield was Operation
Varsity being part of the large Rhine
Crossing in March 1945. Of the 24 guns
only 11could be employed directly. The
remaining 13 guns had either been lost or
landed far away from the planned landing
zone. The regiment (53 Air-landing Light
Regiment RA) could later recover more
guns bringing the total number up to 18
guns, which were organised temporarily in
three 6-guns batteries.

The presentation here is primarily based
on the report prepared by the artillery
headquarters of 1 Airborne Division after
the battle, which is attached to RAHT
MD/1437 and also in a summarised
version in RA Notes 1944, Para 1312.

386 In the literature it is often stated that the
counter-battery programme commenced
at 14.00 hours, see e.g. General Horrock,
but the war diaries of both 124 Field
Regiment RA and 64 Medium Regiment
RA confirm 14.09 hours as the time
when the first rounds were fired. A note
by pencil at the fire order attached to the
war diary of 7 Medium Regiment RA
also confirms the time.

399 In his article Market Garden September
1944 in Royal Artillery Journal, Vol.
CXXV, No.2 Major General Tony
Richardson has on a sketch map marked
the position of 7 Medium Regiment RA
close to the southern shore but a few
kilometres east of the Nijmegen road
bridge. The main parts of the regiment
were then deployed and engaged south of
Veghel and had been ordered to redeploy
forward to the marked position. It is
possible that 27/28 Battery RA moved to
this site already in the night between 24th
and 25th September, but more likely is
that it deployed close to 64 Medium
Regiment RA, to which it had been put
400
under command.

402 The war diary of this regiment obviously
has several errors as regards dates and
actions, e.g. that A Troop already at 15.40
hrs on 21st September should have been
redeployed to the southern shore of Waal.

Captain Trotman had been posted to the
regiment in August as replacement for a
troop commander. He was therefore not
very well known by others when he was
ordered to accompany the 4 Dorset
Battalion across River Rhine. He was
immediately taken prisoner of war,
unharmed, and taken to Germany. He
survived the capture. Nothing was heard
from him after the war, and he himself
did not approach any of his former
comrades in arms until 60 years had
passed. He then came 'out of the
shadows' and got in touch with Douglas
Goddard, who learnt that Trotman after
the war became a Priest in Northern
Ireland. In a long letter to Goddard he
told his story from the night when he
accompanied the Dorset infantry across
River Rhine. The author has got an
extract from this letter from Douglas
