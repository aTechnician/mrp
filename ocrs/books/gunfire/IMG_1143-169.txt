The tanks were allotted 200 rounds per tank, the
anti-tank guns 90 per gun, the Bofors guns 750
per gun and the mortars 300 per each
While the above programme included only
targets outside Rees, a special program: Mus-
tardpot was prepared for the city area itself. This
programme, also intensive in its design, was
prepared by the artillery commander of the
attacking division.
We can now summarise the different fire plans
prepared for XXX Corps. Due to lack of space,
reference is made to the war diaries for details.442
The counter-bombardment programme is sum-
marised in Table 22-4, see also Fig. 22-7:2
The first part, DIAL, was to be done bv
ranging and direct observation of the fire. The
number of targets,
ana
thus
ammunition
allotment, was limited. DROOP I and DROOP
Il were the main parts of the programme and
ammunition allotment was thus good. The final
part, DRUM, which was not limited in time,
aimed at quick counter-bombardment against
enemy batteries which were activated during the
river crossing
The counter-mortar programme comprised
several separate fire plans as shown in Table 22-5.
The first fire plan, CALIBRATE, aimed at
harassing enemy mortar units, but it was aimed
at ranging/checking air burst heights with the
support of the observation resources of the
survey regiment. This was as a preparation for
the main fire plan, COPPER, which was to be
fired only as an air burst programme. The 25-
pounders were to use the new VT fuzes for
maximum height accuracy.
The final fire plan aimed to quickly answer
fire from activated enemy mortars when the
attack was under way, as had been planned for
the artillery counter-bombardment programme.
The
support
of the 51st
(Highland)
Division when attacking across river Rhine,
which was to commence at D-1 21.00 hours,
was divided into several sub-programmes too.
The first two fire plans were 'softening fire pro-
grammes against enemy positions near the river
aiming at reducing morale and will to resist.
Then the main covering fire programme was
launched in support of the crossing. The overall
programme is summarised in Table 22-6.
The first part, TILT, can be seen
as a
'ranging programme' with low ammunition con-
sumption planned. The aim was to provide a
foundation for good accuracy in the main pro-

It might be added that certain units were to
be engaged from D-1 21.00 hours in harassing
fire against targets in depth from the front line,
this to seal off' the area where the main attack
was to take place
Finally, it should be mentioned that the
Pepperpot programme was to be executed between
19.00 hours and 205 was to be executed between

The Mustardpot programme against Rees was
planned for D-1 20.00 hours to 22.00 hours.
The mistakes at Arnhem should not be
repeated - Operation Varsity
There were several lessons learnt from Arnhem
that affected the planning of the large Rhine
crossing
operation. First, complete airborne
divisions should this time be landed the same
day. Second, the landings should be done close
to the objectives, partly on them.
Another important lesson was to make sure
that the airborne units could count on support
from artillery deployed west of the river directly
after landing, at least from medium artillery with
sufficient range. Particularly important in this

context were the two batteries still equipped with
45 inch guns (range around 18.5km) and the
155-mm 'Long Tom' guns which had a range
above 20km. It was of great importance to take
advantage of these units.
From artillery point of view, it was also
essential to make sure that early radio contacts
between the air-landed troops and the ground
forces west of river Rhine could be established.
The air-landings were, as we have seen, a
Corps operation with one British and one
American airborne division. The commander of
the XVIII US Airborne Corps and his staff,
incuding the artillery staff, were to take
ommand of the landed units once they were on
the ground. When this had taken place, the 1st
commando Brigade would leave XII Corps and
also come under his command.
For each airborne division (the 6th British
and 1Tth US Division) an artillery group from
XII Cops was to be put at their disposal for
support during the first 24 hours. As regards the

regiments under command, were allotted to the
6th Airborne Division. The divisional artillery of
the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division and one
medium regiment were put at the disposal of the
American Airborne Division in a similar way.
As further assistance, 8 AGRA was reserved
as a special supporting group as well. It consisted
of one field regiment and the remaining medium
regiments (after two had been allotted to the
52nd (Lowland) Division and one to the 53rd
(Welsh) Division) and one heavy regiment. The
three American 155-mm battalions in the area
were attached as well (3x12 guns).
I will now concentrate the review and
presentation
on the
planning for
the 6th
Airborne Division. This division was planned to
land around the north-western part of Diesfordt
Woods with 3 Parachute Brigade near the river,
with 5 Parachute Brigade northernmost away
from river Rhine and 6 Airlanding Brigade near
Hammenkiln and Ijssel Canal.
The division would protect the northern and
northwestern flanks of XVIII Corps and disturb
the enemy defence east of river Rhine. By doing
this, a large bridgehead would be secured much
quicker. It was an important objective to capture
three bridges across the Ijssel Canal just east of
Hammenkiln.
We can see the incoming air routes on Map
22-7, the northern to be used by the British and
the southern by the Americans. The map does
not show the five supply dropping zones, to be
used by the many transport aircraft during the
first day. These were located close to the
dropping zones.
The selected dropping zones implied that
only 3 Parachute Brigade could be supported by
field regiments west of river Rhine. The two
other brigades were landed too far from the
river. We may here recall that only some 30% of
available shells could reach the maximum range
due to the limited supply of 'Super Charges' for
The
25-pounders.
This would imply some
consequences for the plans devised.
First, it was decided that the division's own
regiment, 53 Airlanding Light Regiment RA,
would be organised temporarily with two 12-
guns batteries. Deployment and firing with this
organisation was trained on Salisbury
Plain
before departure for Rhine. The regiment had in
February started training on the use of 25-
pounders and it was decided that the regiment
would bring two of them to Rhine in addition to
