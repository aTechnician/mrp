Soldier's Life (New York: Henry Holt, 2002). For a more intimate assessment see
John S. D. Eisenhower, General Ike: A Personal Reminiscence (New York: Free
Press, 2003). It was Rear Admiral Morton Deyo who opined that Eisenhower's
smile was worth "twenty divisions." The quotation is from Stephen Ambrose,

if it were true, he wrote, they were "necessary for the conduct of the war." Winston
Churchill, The Hinge of Fate (Boston: Houghton Miffin, 1950), 526-27.
