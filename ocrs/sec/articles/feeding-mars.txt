Feeding Mars: The Role of
Logistics in the German
Defeat in Normandy, 1944
Russell A. Hart
Historians have long recognized that logistical difficulties contributed
Hto German defeat in the 1944 Normandy campaign. The Allied aerial interdiction campaign initiated in March seriously hampered German
resupply operations across the Loire and Seine rivers into Normandy.
The consequent supply shortages not only prevented the Germans from
seriously threatening the Allied bridgehead but also undermined German efforts to mount an effective defence. Beyond this general picture,
however, historians know little about precisely how and to what extent
logistic deficiencies compromised the German defence of Normandy.
This study describes German logistics in the 1944 Normandy campaign
and demonstrates that logistic deficiencies were central to German
defeat, and that they played a major role in the successful American
breakout during Operation ’Cobra’ in late July1
In 1943 the German army in the west, the Westheer, remained a backwater of the German war effort. Under-strength, poorly equipped, and
largely immobile, the Westheer possessed only a limited defensive capability. Nor did it possess the logistic infrastructure - fuel, munitions, and
transport assets - necessary to sustain major action, let alone to repel an
invasion. It was only on 3 November 1943 that Hitler issued his Directive
51 for the strengthening of the Westheer to defeat the inevitable 1944
Allied invasion. Between November 1943 and June 1944, the influx of
fresh troops and Germany’s latest weapons dramatically enhanced the
Westheer’s combat power. Directive 51, however, failed to assign logistic
priority to the west. Thus there was no concomitant expansion of the
Westheer’s logistic resources. On the contrary, the German buildup

emphasized ’teeth’ over ’tail’ to the detriment of the Westheer’s ability to
sustain a protracted defence. Inadequate supply, transport, and service
units were combed out to strengthen combat formations. In part, the
Westheer’s inability to expand its logistic base before D-Day reflected the
sustained decline of resources as Germany approached its sixth year of
war. To a greater degree, however, it illustrated a traditional German
military disdain for logistics.2
The most pernicious deficiency of the German army in its fifth year
of war was its progressive demotorization. In 1939 Germany was among
the least motorized societies in western Europe. Outside the elite,
armoured forces, most of the German army remained a predominantly
horse-drawn infantry force. After June 1941, attrition on the Eastern
Front inexorably shrank the German motor transport pool and with it
the mobility that was instrumental to both Germany’s offensive and
defensive victories. Up to 1943, confiscation of vehicles from the occupied territories offset Germany’s battlefield losses: in 1942 alone, Germany rounded up over 600 000 vehicles. After Kursk, though, attrition
progressively demotorized the German army. Between February and
April 1944 alone, the German army’s deficit of trucks and prime movers
increased by 127% and 46% respectively.’
The German motor vehicle shortage was most pronounced in the west,
where the largely immobile occupation forces depended on the excellent
French rail network for transportation. Few trucks were available in the
west to form a strategic transport reserve, and lack of spare parts entailed
low serviceability rates. This immobility hindered the combat preparation
of the Westheer prior to D-Day. By 6 June 1944 most German formations
remained seriously deficient in motor vehicles, and consequently their
mobility was limited. This poor mobility made the Westheer dependent
on rail transport to redeploy its forces to an invasion site and for resupply
operations. At war games in January 1944, the Germans estimated that
without the French railroads they would require 40 000 tons of trucking
capacity to defeat an invasion, or more than eight times the then available strategic transport reserve. The excess capacity of the French rail
system and the existence of canal supply routes, however, convinced the

Germans that they could resupply their forces by rail despite anticipated
Allied interdiction efforts. Consequently, the Quartermaster General
West, Major Otto Eckstein, was not unduly perturbed when in March
1944 the Allies unleashed an aerial interdiction campaign.44
However, the Germans seriously underestimated the effectiveness of
the Allied interdiction campaign. Between March and D-Day, Allied airpower isolated Normandy from the east by destroying all the bridges
across the Seine below Paris, while attacks on railroad stations, marshalling yards, engine sheds, coaling stations, rail junctions, repair shops,
and rolling stock all but ended train movement into Normandy. From
mid-April the air attacks impinged on German troop and supply movements. Consequently an increasing backlog of trains developed throughout the west which delayed the arrival of large quantities of new weapons,
construction materials, and supplies. On the eve of D-Day, over 1 700
military trains were still struggling toward their destinations. The air
offensive’s greatest impact, though, was on the flow of fuel to the west.
At the beginning of June, trains carrying 3.233 million gallons of fuel,
the equivalent of 15% of the entire German stock in the west, were back-

logged across France.55
The Germans took three sets of countermeasures to minimize the
impact of the air offensive on their resupply capability prior to D-Day.
Anti-aircraft batteries moved to protect bridges, communications hubs,
and rail lines. German rail engineer and bridge-building units were
strengthened and redeployed to the Seine in an effort to restore communication links with Normandy. Finally, the Quartermaster General
West attempted to expand his strategic truck transport reserve via vigorous confiscation drives among both the military and civilian sectors.’

In Apr. 1944 the Germans had in the West 3 heavy (60-ton) and 6 light (8-ton)
bridging columns; by 17 May the number had increased to 4 and 11 respectively.

421
These counter-measures met with little success. Greater anti-aircraft
protection could only slow the inexorable destruction of German communications ; but it also increased munitions expenditures and hence
exacerbated German supply difficulties. Despite steady reinforcement,
the German railroad engineer and bridge-building forces in the west
were simply swamped by the scale of destruction. Moreover, their efforts
to restore communications were poorly coordinated. Three factors
compromised the German effort to expand their strategic trucking
capacity: the Wehrmacht’s overall shortage of motor vehicles, the need to
improve the mobility of combat formations, and Hitler’s insistence on
overexpanding the Westheer. Inadequate production meant that only a
limited number of new trucks could be sent to the west during the spring
of 1944. These trucks were assigned both to new divisions that Hitler
insisted be raised in the west and to existing divisions to enhance their
mobility. Since new production was insufficient, the strategic truck
reserve had to surrender about 10% of its capacity in May to complete
the equipping of these new divisions. Therefore, because of Hitler’s
insistence on overexpansion, the Westheer was unable to expand its strategic truck transport reserve (see Table 1).7

The number of personnel employed on railroad repair activities increased from

Between Apr. and Aug. 1944 the Westheer received 11254 trucks. Despite this influx,
Hitler’s insistence on overexpanding the Westheer saw its truck shortage increase from
7 281 on 1 Aug. 1943 to 11447 on 1 June 1944. ’Kraftfahrzeuge (ungepanzert) Heer:

but demolished again in early July, another reopened in early July but was destroyed
again before the end of the month, and a further two reopened in late July.

422
The Allied air offensive also eroded the German logistic position in
the west prior to D-Day. The brake applied by the air campaign to the
flow of supplies effectively reduced German stockpiles. The air offensive
forced German supply operations off the rails and onto the roads, thereby increasing fuel consumption. To preserve dwindling stocks, the Westheer introduced stringent rationing on 3 June which halted 30% of its
motor vehicles and slashed fuel allotted for training. The strategic transport reserve was forced to deliver supplies by road; its serviceability rates
declined after April, eradicating the steady improvement initiated in November 1943 (see Table 1). Thus, before the invasion, the air campaign
had eroded the Westheer’s ability both to redeploy its reserves to an
invasion site and to resupply such forces. Clearly, if the Germans proved

unable to defeat the Allies on the beaches, they could only fight a protracted defence in the west if unprecedented levels of supplies could be
delivered from the Reich to the invasion sector.88
Thus on 6 June 1944 the German logistic position in France remained
inadequate for a prolonged defence. Munitions stockpiles were limited:
the Westheer had amassed about three weeks’ stocks for its coastal defence
divisions, four weeks’ stocks for the port fortresses, but only two weeks’
stocks for its mobile reserves. The German fuel situation was even more
precarious. The Westheer had only seven to ten days’ fuel stockpiled for
its strategic reserves. While supplies with the front-line troops were
adequate for the initial stages of an invasion, if the assault was not quickly
repulsed a successful defence demanded the rapid shipment of the
reserve stockpiles to the invasion site. Given the attack on the French
rail system, completing this mission presented serious problems.’
From war diaries it is possible to reconstruct the German logistic situation in north-western France on the eve of D-Day (see Tables 2 and 3).
The defending German 7th Army possessed 18 748 tons of stockpiled
munitions, sufficient for about three weeks’ combat. Of this total, however, only 38% (7172 tons) was stockpiled in Normandy; the rest was
stored in distant Breton depots (see Figure 1). The 7th Army’s petrol
situation was more perilous. On 1 June it possessed 1.035 million gallons
of reserve fuel stocks, sufficient for only two weeks’ mobile operations.

The 7th Army’s gravest problem, though, remained distribution. On the
eve of D-Day its quartermaster had at his disposal only 248 trucks with
a lift capacity of 994 metric tons. This was utterly inadequate to meet
even minimal resupply needs. Given the effects of the air campaign, the
7th Army was dependent on the delivery of supplies from the strategic
reserve depots located around Paris. In the first days of the invasion,
however, Allied air attacks closed all the major rail lines into Normandy

from the south across the Loire, thus completing the isolation of Norm-

andy.’o
On 6-7 June the 7th Army began to redeploy its operational mobile
Normandy. To accomplish this task alone, however, required
20 times its available lift capacity. Thus as early as 7 June planned German troop redeployments to Normandy grossly exceeded the available
trucking capacity, and the 7th Army’s ability to resupply these formations
once committed to combat. In these circumstances, the Germans established a fixed policy in an effort to forestall the Allied establishment of
an
impregnable lodgement. Priority was accorded to getting the troops
to Normandy. Once there, the Westheer would worry about resupplying
its forces. Given the effective interdiction of rail communications and
the inadequacy of the strategic truck reserve, this resupply mission would
present the Germans with insurmountable difficulties.&dquo;
The priority accorded to troop redeployments exacerbated German
resupply difficulties. In consequence, persistent logistical deficiencies
plagued the German defence of Normandy. Because of the paralysis of
the French rail network, the shortage of road lift capacity, and the priority given to troop movements, the Quartermaster General West could
not dispatch sufficient supplies to cover front line consumption. Allied
operations (air attack, sabotage, etc.) also inflicted a heavy toll on German resupply operations. During June enemy action destroyed 20% of
German supplies en route to the front. Moreover, the aerial threat seriously delayed the delivery of supplies to the combat zone. Resupply operations had to be confined largely to night time. Round-trip resupply
operations from Paris to Normandy thus averaged four to five days.
Consequently, only a fraction of the supplies consumed at the front
could be replaced. Up to 15 June, average daily deliveries of munitions
covered less than 15% of daily expenditures. By 28 June only 37% of the
munitions dispatched to the 7th Army had arrived. German supplies were
even more vulnerable to Allied air attack once in the theatre of operations. Several major German munitions depots were destroyed by air
reserves to

0355/44 geh. d. 18/6/44, NARA T-311, 1, 7000704-5. Direct comparison of lift
capacities of Allied and German trucks are complicated by two factors. First, the
imperial ton is 1.6% larger than the metric ton. Second, unlike the Allies, who rated
trucks according to their payload capacity, German classification was based on the
weight of a loaded vehicle. Since a vehicle can carry roughly its own weight, the
German rating system actually doubles the true lift capacity. Hence an Allied 1.5-ton
truck had about the same lift capacity as a German 3-ton truck. Thus the true lift
capacity of the 7th Army on D-Day was about 500 tons. ’St&auml;rke des Transportraumes

The Allies did not seriously attack the Loire bridges prior to D-Day because the total

attack in June. Consequently, the 7th Army’s stocks rapidly diminished.
Thus German units throughout the campaign lacked sufficient ammunition for offensive operations. 12
The German petrol situation became even more critical. Between 9
and 13 June the Quartermaster General West dispatched his entire petrol
reserve to Normandy. Fuel delivery was made more problematic by the
dearth of fuel tankers in France and their vulnerability to air attack.
Moreover, German fuel depots were primary targets for Allied air strikes.
The depot code-named ’Berta’ located near Domfront was destroyed by
air attack on 13 June. A more serious blow was the destruction of the
largest German fuel depot in the west, located at Gennevilliers outside
Paris, on 22 June with the loss of 607 000 gallons of fuel. Thus available
fuel stocks plummeted. By 14 June the 7th Army had no stockpiled fuel
left in Normandy and only 63 000 gallons in Brittany, less than one day’s
supply. Even front-line units were down to a mere two or three days’
stocks (sufficient to travel 100-150 km). Thus by the second week of the
invasion the 7th Army had become dependent on daily fuel deliveries
by rail and road from outside Normandy. Thereafter, only stringent
rationing and repeated depredation of other field commands and Wehrmach branches could sustain German mobility in Normandy. 13
In the first week of the invasion, Allied ground forces reaped considerable benefits from the air offensive: the Germans were unable to run a
single supply train into Normandy across the Seine and Loire. By 14 June
the German supply situation was officially described as ’catastrophic’.
During that week the Germans realized that a protracted defence was
only possible if rail communications were restored to Normandy. Thereafter, the Germans abandoned their uncoordinated and dispersed rail
repair operations and focused on opening - and keeping open - two
major rail arteries into Normandy: the Paris-Versailles-Dreux-Surdon
line from the east and the Tours-Le Mans-Alencon-Sees-Surdon line
from the south (see Figure 1). These two lines served the 7th Army’s
major depots in the Le Mans-Alen~on area. Frantic work reopened these
two lines during the second week of the invasion. On the night of 1819 June rail travel resumed from Paris to Dreux and Verneuil and across

the Loire at Tours as far as Le Mans. The Tours St Cyr bridge remained
badly damaged, however, that it could not hold the weight of fully
loaded trains. Locomotives had to be detached on the approach to the
bridge, the wagons hauled across and then recoupled. On 25 June the
badly damaged Tours Cinq Mars bridge also reopened under similar
operating restrictions. The precarious condition of the two Tours
bridges, plus the damage inflicted on the rail infrastructure in that area,
meant that the southern artery remained only partially accessible. Most
trains thus continued to unload south of the Loire until the end ofJuly. 14
While the Germans endeavoured to reopen rail lines into Normandy,
they were dependent on the delivery of supplies by road. Despite his best
efforts, which included rigorous round-ups, constant attrition prevented
the Quartermaster General West from significantly expanding his road
transport capacity after D-Day (see Table 1). In fact, during the Normandy campaign the demotorization of the German forces accelerated as
automobile losses exceeded deliveries. Allied tactical air forces inflicted
a heavy toll on German transport assets moving supplies up from the rail
heads and depots to the front. Furthermore, the relegation of resupply
operations largely to night-time increased accident rates. In the first ten
days of the invasion alone, 20% of the German strategic transport reserve
was disabled by air attacks, breakdowns, and accidents. By late June the
Germans were losing an average of 30 supply trucks daily. Incomplete
figures for June indicate that over 2 225 tons of truck transport capacity
was lost on resupply missions. These were in addition to losses at the
front: in June alone Army Group B lost 4 200 vehicles, including 1 866
trucks. Despite all their efforts, the Germans were unable significantly to
expand their strategic transport reserve during the campaign. 15
The German dependence on road resupply increased fuel consumption, thus aggravating the German fuel shortage. During June the strategic transport reserve alone consumed 800 000 gallons. Allied action

also interdicted a significant proportion of German fuel dispatched to
the west. Of the 9.9 million gallons sent in June, 1.95 million gallons

destroyed en route to Normandy, a million gallons were destroyed
at depots, and more than 172 000 gallons were lost in the combat zone.
Thus only about 60% of the fuel dispatched in June made it to the front.
Army Group B made the pessimistic assessment that without a marked
improvement in its logistic situation it would run out of fuel between 20
and 25 July,. 16
In late June, however, the German logistic situation in Normandy
finally began to improve. This was the result of four developments: the
reopening of rail movement into Normandy described above; the
initiation of ferrying operations on both flanks of the Normandy front;
were

increased ’self-reliance’ as front-line divisions sent their own truck columns to collect supplies from rear depots; and the division of German
supply responsibilities on the invasion front. 17
With the restoration of limited rail communications to Normandy, the
Germans were finally able to run a limited number of supply trains into
the combat zone. In the latter half of June the Germans ran, on average,
two supply trains a night to the advanced rail-heads. The restoration of
rail communications increased the flow of supplies to the front in late
June by about one-quarter. During the week 8-14 July, 17% and 35% of
total German deliveries of munitions and fuel arrived by rail
Beginning in mid-June, the Germans also expanded ferrying operations across the Seine. In spring 1944, 17 ferries were operating on the
Seine with a cargo capacity of 420 tons. During the first weeks of the
invasion the Germans transported additional ferries to the Seine and
constructed new ones on site. German naval personnel worked feverishly
to establish new dock facilities at Elbeuf for barges carrying supplies
down the Seine from Paris. On 18 June the first barges left Paris,
unloading at Elbeuf three days later. Thereafter the Seine ferrying operation expanded rapidly, and by July it was delivering about one-fifth of
the supplies reaching Normandy.&dquo;

The 846th and 850th heavy bridging columns moved to the Seine to construct and
operate ferries, and were joined after 13 June by the ferry company of the 86th
Amphibious Engineer Battalion. By 23 July the number of ferries operating had
increased to 26, with a lift capacity of 603 tons. Between 1 and 10 July an average of
433 tons were delivered daily. In the week 8-14 July, Seine ferrying accounted for
16% and 19% respectively of total munitions and fuel delivered to Normandy. By 1
Aug. Allied aerial reconnaissance had identified 104 vessels operating on the lower
Seine. ’F&auml;hren u. &uuml;bersetzmittel Lagekarte’, A.Pi.F&uuml;h. 15 Br.B.Nr. 16/44 geh., v.

429
Parallel ferrying activities were also initiated from the Atlantic ports
of Bordeaux and Royan to the ports of Brest, St Nazaire, St Malo, and
Cherbourg. But due to lack of shipping capacity, Allied air attacks, the
distances involved, and supply shortages in western France, the Atlantic
ferrying operation never made as significant a contribution to the German resupply effort as did the Seine ferrying. At its height, during the
week 8-14 July, Atlantic ferrying accounted for 16% of total munitions

delivered.2°
With the reopening of rail communications and the instigation of ferrying, the flow of supplies to central Normandy significantly increased.
By mid-July half of total German supply deliveries arrived by rail and
water. But the major German difficulty remained the
transshipment of
these supplies from the rear depots, ports, and rail-heads to the front.
This difficulty could only be alleviated by combat units collecting their
own supplies. From mid-June the use of divisional
transport columns on
supply-collection missions to army depots and rail-heads became commonplace. The losses suffered by the truck columns employed on these
missions exacerbated the increasing immobility of front-line units (see
Table 4).&dquo;
In early July, the Westheer divided logistic responsibility for the Normandy front. Hitherto, the 7th Army had been solely responsible for all
resupply operations. Hereafter, Panzer Group West assumed the supply

mission on the right (or eastern) flank where it opposed the Anglo-Canadians at Caen. The 7th Army’s responsibility was limited to the western
flank opposite the American forces advancing on St L6. This separation
eased the administrative strain that the 7th Army’s quartermaster had
been under.
During July the German logistical situation on the eastern flank continued to improve, albeit slowly. The Germans managed to run several
supply trains through to Dreux and Verneuil nightly, as well as to unload
several barges at Elbeuf. By concentrating its resources on only a couple
of lines, the German railroad engineers were able to keep the VersaillesDreux line open despite repeated air attacks. Allied air power also proved
unable to neutralize the Seine ferries: they were much harder to hit than
bridges or rail installations, and ferrying mainly took place at night. Panzer Group West was thus able to resupply its forces sufficiently to halt
all Anglo-Canadian efforts to push south-east and capture Falaise.
On the German western flank, where the 7th Army opposed the Americans at St L6, however, there was no parallel improvement in July. On
the contrary, the German logistic situation deteriorated further. Ferrying
was less extensive, resupply distances greater, and lateral communications lines less developed. Moreover, the Germans simply proved
unable to run as many supply trains into Normandy across the Loire as
they could across the Seine. Consequently, in the face of major American
offensive action between 3 and 21 July that culminated in the fall of St
L6, the 7th Army’s supply stockpiles dwindled. But it was the German
inability to sustain rail deliveries across the Loire that contributed
directly to the collapse of the German front at St L6 in late July. The
catalyst for an ultimately fatal decline in the 7th Army’s supply situation
on the American sector of the Normandy front was the renewed destruction of the St Cyr railway bridge and the marshalling yards at the communications hub of Tours on 15 July. Since its reopening in mid-June,
Tours had become the supply lifeline for the 7th Army. Between 9 June
and 7 July, 10 440 tons of supplies passed through Tours by rail, an average of 360 tons a day. This route accounted for about one-third of the
total supplies reaching western Normandy, and more than 40% of the
7th Army’s fuel. The importance of the Tours supply line can be gauged
by the immediate and frantic German effort to repair the bridge by erect-

ing a temporary span.22
As the Tours supply artery was reclosed, the Quartermaster General
22

The Saumur and Tours Cinq Mars rail bridges were destroyed anew some time in
early July and a similar fate befell the Nantes rail bridge on 20 July, by which date
Chalonnes was again down. Thus on the eve of Cobra only the single-track Port
Boulet rail bridge remained open over the Loire. The Allies never attacked this
bridge because it was a tertiary route of limited capacity. PRO, Kew, DEFE 3/62,
Ultra Intercept XL 3649, 27/7/1944. On the destruction of Tours and its logistical
importance see Hg. B Ib Br.B.Nr. 0908/44 geh., d. 15/7/1944, NARA T-311, 1,
0000804. The renewed destruction of the Loire rail bridges, especially the Tours St
Cyr bridge, was fortuitous in the sense that it was part of the ongoing interdiction
campaign and unconnected to the then embryonic Cobra plan.

431
West’s ability to resupply the 7th Army by road continued to decline as
his trucking pool diminished. Due to the few lateral lines of communication in western Normandy, and the greater distances involved, resupplying the 7th Army was more difficult than supplying Panzer Group
West on the eastern flank. Moreover, a smaller proportion of the supplies
dispatched to the 7th Army made it to the front. Even before the destruction of Tours, the 7th Army had become increasingly dependent on its
own truck columns to bring up supplies.23
The destruction of the Tours supply artery accelerated the decline in
the 7th Army’s logistical position. The Quartermaster General West
could not compensate for the cessation of rail delivery of fuel by
increased road delivery. Consequently, in the week after the destruction
of Tours, petrol dispatched to the 7th Army fell by 22%. Moreover, the
destruction of the 7th Army fuel depot ’Bruno’ near Chateaubriant by
Allied air attack on 16 July compounded German fuel difficulties. An
examination of fuel returns for the LXXXIV Corps on the St L6 front
demonstrates a sustained depletion of petrol stocks at the very moment
when US forces were preparing to launch Operation ’Cobra’, their breakout effort (see Table 5).24
The Germans reopened the Tours rail bridge on 23 July. But this was
too late to replenish the 7th Army’s supplies before the onset of Cobra
on 25 July. In the meantime the Anglo-Canadians launched Operation
’Goodwood’ (18-20 July) to hold German reserves on the eastern flank.
Controversy still surrounds the contribution that Goodwood made to the
success of Cobra. But what historians have missed in assessing Goodwood’s contribution was its impact on German logistics. It was in this
realm that its contribution was decisive. The Quartermaster General West
was only able to dispatch petrol by road to the 7th Army on one day in
the week between Goodwood and Cobra, as his tanker columns were

Between 8 and 14 July 48% and 43%, respectively, of the 7th Army’s munitions and
fuel arrived by rail and water. After the destruction of Tours, all of its supplies
arrived by road. The proportion of total fuel deliveries by road that the 7th Army
was forced to collect itself increased from 51% between 17 and 21 July to 86%
between 16 and 22 July. Ob. West, ’Versorgungsberichten Stand: 10/6-27/7/1944’,

fully committed to resupply operations on the Anglo-Canadian sector
after the heavy Goodwood expenditures. The 7th Army only maintained
its petrol receipts at 73% of pre-Goodwood levels by employing most of
its own trucks to collect fuel from the Le Mans, Alen~on, and Dreux
rail-heads. Even then, on the eve of Cobra, the German LXXXIV Corps
defending the St L6 front only had sufficient fuel to travel 74 km, enough
for about two days’ heavy combat. In fact, as the Americans unleashed
Cobra on 25 July, the first fuel train arrived at Le Mans via Tours, too
late to reach the German front-line troops during the decisive first 48
hours in which the German front was broken. 21
Evidence suggests that the closure of the Tours rail route had a less
detrimental impact on the flow of munitions than on the flow of fuel to
the 7th Army. Nonetheless, it did have an important impact on the
munitions situation at the front. To increase turnaround time after the
destruction of Tours, the Quartermaster General West curtailed the distance that his transport columns were allowed to travel. Thus on 17 July
the Germans abandoned deliveries to the 7th Army’s largest and most
forward munitions depot, ’Michel’ at St Sever, 40 km east of Granville.
Likewise, ’Mina’ and the fuel depot ’Brehmse’ were ordered to close on
21 July. Instead, deliveries were diverted to depots further back such as
’Martha’, east of Domfront. This quadrupled the distance that divisional
transport columns on the St L6 front had to travel to collect munitions,
and further strained the German petrol situation. Consequently, German
munitions holdings on the St L6 sector steadily declined during July.
Between late June and 24 July, Kampfgruppe Kentner’s munitions stocks
for machine guns and mortars declined by 64% and 75%, respectively.
A rare extant munitions return for Kampfgruppe Kuske of the 17th SS
Panzer-grenadier Division ’G6tz von Berlichingen’ on the St L6 sector on
the eve of Cobra also illustrates the extent of the German munitions
shortages. The battle group possessed only 1000 rounds per machine
gun, and 30 rounds per rifle - about sufficient for one day of heavy com-

bat.26

nation with the badly weakened state of the German defence. But close
analysis of the density of the German defence on the St L6 and Caen
sectors on the eve of Cobra illustrates that there was little disparity in
German strength on the two sectors (see Table 6). Moreover, during
August the Germans would successfully stall three Anglo-Canadian
offensives where the Germans were far more heavily outnumbered than
at Cobra.27

The missing link in the explanation of the success of Cobra are Gerlogistical deficiencies. During Cobra, for the first time in the campaign, such difficulties prevented the Germans from offering an effective
defence. It was these problems, as much as combat exhaustion, that made
it impossible for the Germans to cordon off the Cobra break-in on 256 July as they had all previous Allied offensives. By the first evening of
Cobra, the defending German LXXXIV Corps had expended all the
ammunition for the 88 mm anti-aircraft guns which formed the backbone of its anti-tank defence. Supply shortages explain why the 7th
Army’s reserve, the elite and still powerful 2nd SS Panzer Division ’Das
Reich’, utterly failed to take its presence felt on the Cobra battlefield.
On 26 July, the 7th Army reported that the counter-measures by the
defending LXXXIV Corps had been ’significantly prohibited’ by petrol
shortages: that very day Das Reich had to abandon two companies of
Panther tanks for want of fuel. By 28 July, LXXXIV Corps’s munitions
stocks were ’critically low’. When combined with the German numerical
weakness, German fuel and munitions shortages prevented the Germans
from halting the Cobra breakout.2$
Once the Americans had secured a breakthrough, mounting logistical
problems and dwindling mobility unravelled the German defence in Normandy. The crisis at the front forced the Germans to resume daylight
resupply missions in late July, which caused German motor vehicle losses

front: German defeat in Normandy became inevitable.
shoring up
The 5th Panzer Army (the renamed Panzer Group West) then had to
resupply all the German forces in Normandy from distant depots located
near the Seine. The retreating German forces thus rapidly began to run
out of fuel across the entire front. From 15 August fuel shortages increasingly stranded 7th Army formations, and for the first time the Germans
began to abandon stranded armour en masse. In the last two weeks of
August the fleeing German forces abandoned motor vehicles by the thousand. The Germans managed to extricate across the Seine about onethird of the troops, one-quarter of the vehicles, and 10% of the heavy
weapons that they had committed to Normandy.29
Clearly, logistical difficulties were a major factor in the collapse of the
German defence of Normandy. They prevented the Germans from making a serious threat against the Allied lodgement and undermined the
were

German defence. In the absence of rail communications, insufficient supplies were delivered by road to the front and existing stockpiles were
thus rapidly depleted just to maintain German forces at defensive supply
levels. Only by reopening one major rail artery into Normandy across
both the Seine and Loire and by expanding ferrying activities did a gradual improvement in the German logistic situation in Normandy
materialize in late June. During July this improvement continued in eastern Normandy, where Panzer Group West opposed the Anglo-Canadians.
The key to this was the Seine ferrying operations and the rail deliveries
from Paris to Dreux and Verneuil. From these rail-heads the distance to
the front by road was relatively short, and thus a higher proportion of
supplies dispatched actually reached the front. In western Normandy,
where the German 7th Army faced the Americans, there was no improvement in the supply situation during July. The Germans proved unable
to run as many supply trains along the Tours-Alencon-Le Mans line as
they could on the eastern flank. Ferrying along the Atlantic coast was
less significant, and the distances involved much greater. Finally, the distance by road from Alen~on to Le Mans and the Breton ports to the
front was considerably further too. Hence a smaller proportion of supplies made it to the 7th Army and delivery time was greater. Consequently, the German supply situation on the western flank continued to
decline in July. With the renewed destruction of Tours on 15 July, the
German resupply effort for the 7th Army suffered a crippling blow.

rail heads in eastern Normandy were hindered by the greater distances
involved and by the launching of the Anglo-Canadian Goodwood offensive on 18 July. The Germans did manage to reopen the Tours line on
23 July, but this proved too late to replenish the 7th Army’s supplies
before the start of Operation ’Cobra’ two days later. Critically short of
fuel and munitions, the 7th Army proved unable to halt the American
breakout at the end of July, thereby condemning the Germans to defeat
in Normandy. In retrospect, the fortuitous destruction of Tours ten days
before the initiation of Cobra proved optimal timing for the success of
the American breakout bid. If Tours had been destroyed any earlier the
Germans could have repaired the bridge in time to bring up fresh supplies ; any later and German supply levels might not have been sufficiently
eroded to ensure a decisive breakout.
