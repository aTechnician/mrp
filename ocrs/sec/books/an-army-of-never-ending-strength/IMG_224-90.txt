Sherman Firefly 17-pounder variants in March and a further thirty-six battle
tanks of various types in April. 1º Since all three of its regiments were armoured,
thebrigade did not operate any non-"A" vehicle heavy weapons. As of 30 April,
the brigade contained 200 battle tanks against its war establishment total of
226, which was 88 percent of its authorized strength.''' During its time in
northwest Europe, the brigade had not been required to fight any major tank
battes, nor did its regiments regularly face a well-equipped enemy offering
sif resistance. Any casualties that occurred within the brigade during April
and May were quickly replaced, with eighty-three reinforcement personnel
joining the three regiments. 2 At the end of hostilities, these regiments were all
overstrength in personnel. For instance, the 12th Canadian Armoured Regiment
contained 45 officers and 686 other ranks as of s May 1945, making it 6 percent
overstrength. 13
In the final phase of the spring 1945 fighting, the four regiments of the znd
Canadian AGRA followed the advancing znd Canadian Corps into the northern
Netherlands and Germany. Moving constantly from position to position, they
struggled to keep up with the rapid advances of the infantry and armoured
brigades. At this stage, German resistance was so weak that by the time the
AGRA regiments had reached a firine position, the enemy had been overcome
One of the farthest advancing AGRA medium regiments was the th Medium
Regiment, RCA, which ended the war in Hesel, Germany, near Leer.
The is Canadian AGRA units spent most of their existence in support of st
Canadian Corps operations in Italy. As mentioned earlier, once redeployed to

in Belgium in February and March. This formation consisted of the ist, 2nd,
and sth Medium Regiments, RCA, and the 1th Army Field Artillery Regiment,
4.5-inch guns. The uth Army Field Regiment, RCA, was self-propelled, being
equipped with the Sexton 25-pounder self-propelled howitzer. The four RCA
regimante were deploved to subnor ict Canadian Corne Oberations in the
Netherlands during the 2 to 19 April phase of fighting.
In their operational role, ist Canadian AGRA units supported the Allied
crossing of the Ilssel River in April and the advance to the Grebbe River, where
offensive operations ceased. Because of the enemy forces limited combat ca-
pability, the ist Canadian AGRA suffered few losses during its operations with
the ist Canadian Corps. While the ist Canadian AGRA medium regiments
were combat-capable, they had not been reinforced to 100 percent of their war
