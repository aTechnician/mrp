Printer and Controller of Stationery, 1960), 284-85. Despite evidence of higher infantry-
casualty rates in Italy and totally different geographical terrain, North African level wastage
rates were utilized by CMHQ for northwest Europe. Using these projections, it appeared
that enough Canadian reinforcements were present in the United Kingdom during the
spring of 1944.

The reinforcement battalion itself was an administrative holding organization for reinforce-
ments rather than an army battalion trained in a specific trade or mission. It usually con-
sisted of several hundred transient personnel, controlled and administered by a permanent
battalion command structure.

refers to only 25 percent of the reinforcements having combat experience illustrating the

1 LAC, RG 24, vol. 18,616, "Reinforcement Drafts from UK by Date and Amount." The 2
September 1944 draft from the United Kingdom, SP INF 4, consisted of 91 officers and
Số2 other ranks. Divided among the infantry regiments of the 2nd and grd Canadian
Infantry Divisions and the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, it was not a huge amount.
' Stacey, The Victory Campaign, 631-33. Reinforcements coming through took an average
of three to four days transit to show up on the nominal rolls of the receiving regiment. In
October 1944, before the Port of Antwerp opened, reinforcements took seven days to
arrive. This delay was due to the increased distance from the Normandy beachhead to the
front line in the Scheldt.

of coal divisional casualties, a large percentage that highlights the importance of the re-
inforcement company in this additional role.
