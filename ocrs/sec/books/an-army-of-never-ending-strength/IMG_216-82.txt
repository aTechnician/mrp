in their non-"A" vehicle weapons inventories. A total of eighty-four 40 mm anti-
aircraft guns, 17-pounder antitank guns, and 2-inch mortars were on strength
versus a war establishment total of seventy-two."
For the 2nd Canadian Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA), equipment
challenges were not an issue during its campaign in northwest Europe, Asshown
in Figure 8.2, the operational equipment levels of the three 2nd Canadian AGRA
medium regiments were always near 100 percent. If they were to keep delivering
the effective indirect fire support that Canadian Army operations revolved
around, levels could not drop. These units were in action every day in contrast
to the infantry, armoured, antitank, and antiaircraft units. Like the divisional
RCA field regiments, the only time they were not in action was when they were
in transit to their next run positions. Strenath returns for and Canadian AGRA
units on the eve of the February Rhineland battles illustrate that they were
constantly reinforced during the winter months. On 27 January, the 7th Medium
Regiment, RCA, contained 28 officers and s32 other ranks, 99 Percentof its war
establishment?" The 3rd Medium Regiment, RCA was also strong, consisting of

The First Canadian Army encountered heavy resistance during the 1945
Rhineland fighting, which occurred during Operations Veritable and
Blockbuster. Both operations were supported by significant artillery programs
designed to reduce German defences and inflict a large number of casualties.
The znd Canadian AGRA, along with other British AGRA formations, played
a central role in these programs. The fire of these regiments along with the
divisional 25-pounder field regiments was crucial in destroying German pos-
ition and repulsing their counterattacks. Casualty totals for the February and
March were 67 (battle) and 312 (nonbattle) among the four 2nd Canadian AGRA
regiments.?* The fact that the nonbattle casualties outweighed the battle casual-
ties illustrates Germany's reduced ability that spring to attack or destroy
Canadian artillery positions.
Though it had been assembling through the month of March, it was only on
7 April 1945 that returns for the ist Canadian Infantry Division appeared on the
daily "Consolidated Casualty and Strength State" return at First Canadian Army
Headquarters. The division's strength was 880 officers and 15,819 other ranks,
totalling 16,699 personnel? The transit period from Italy had allowed these
regiments to be rested and refitted, and their personnel levels were high. The
48th Highlanders of Canadas strength stood at 38 officers and 830 other ranks,
2 percent overstrength? The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada consisted of 39
officers and 837 other ranks, 4 percent overstrength.?" The noninfantry regiments
within the division were also at satisfactory personnel levels prior to combat
operations in mid-April 1945. Take the strengths of two regiments of divisional
troops as examples. As of 7 April, the 4th Canadian Reconnaissance Regiment's
strength was 42 officers and 759 other ranks, 97 percent of its authorized
strength.» The Saskatoon Light Infantry's strength on the same date was 34
officers and 693 other ranks, 99 percent of its war establishment.?
It is only partially possible to assess how successful the First Canadian Army
was in re-equipping the division with vehicles and weapons in March. Its data
was not included in the 21st Army Group's consolidated vehicle position report
return for 31 March. During this period, its "A" vehicle returns would have been
in flux because of the re-equipment process. The division's vehicle return for 30
April is included, but the earlier nonreporting makes it impossible to compare
pre- and postcombat "A" vehicle states.? The division's data was present on the
21st Army Group's equipment state return of 30 April, which covered all types
of nonvehicle major weapons systems such as artillery pieces, mortars, and
medium machine guns.3
