Major-General Montague, in charge of administration at CMHQ. He com-
municated them to Lieutenant-General Stuart, who was in Italy. Ironically,
Stuart was involved in discussing the creation of a new infantry brigade for the
5th Canadian Armoured Division. Five days passed before Stuart returned to
the United Kingdom and then flew to First Canadian Army headquarters to
speak with its commander, General I.D.G. Cerar. On as July, Stuart finally took
drastic corrective action, issuing orders to begin a large-scale remustering of
general-duty personnel in other trades. A full 25 Percent of all Royal Canadian
Artillery (RCA) reinforcements and 60 percent of all Royal Canadian Army
Service Corps reinforcements would be remustered as other ranks infantry.
This was the correct course of action, but Stuart arrived at it far too late.
On 2 August, during a trip to NDHO in Ottawa, he spoke with the chief of the
general staff, Lieutenant-General J.C. Murchie."' Not wishing to appear an
alarmist, Stuart failed to communicate the urgency of the problem and how it
could be solved. The minister of national defence, J.L. Ralston, would later claim
that he was not fully informed of events. In the events of August 1944 and
the months leading up to them, General Crear cannot be accused of extreme
negligence. What he must take the blame for, however, is accepting at face value
The Sixty-Day Shortage 35
inaccurate wastage rates and tolerating other trades and headquarters that were
obviously overstaffed. Despite being pressed to allow partially trained re-
inforcements forward, Crerar did stand fast on the standard of training: no
untrained personnel reached front-line infantry regiments.53
At the same time, casualties continued to be incurred at a rapid rate. On 25
July alone, Operation Spring caused roughly 1,500 battle casualties. 54 Despite
receiving reinforcements, by 31 July the strength of the 2nd Canadian Infantry
Division had dropped by 1,211 personnel. On 4 August, General Crerar stated
in a report that the reinforcement situation was the most serious problem facing
the First Canadian Army: the deficit hovered at over 1,900 personnel. He went
on to state: "It would seriously impair our breakout exploitation tasks" if it were
allowed to continue. On 8 August, on the eve of Operation Totalize, the largest
Canadian armoured attack of the Second World War, Crerar again pressed for
urgent action on reinforcements.57
Two days later, Brigadier M.H.S. Penhale of CMHQ visited First Canadian
Army headquarters to discuss the situation. It was decided that infantry-
training standards would in no way be compromised and there would be no
dilution or shortening of training for remustered soldiers. In the following
weeks, a significant number of infantry reinforcements did reach the First
Canadian Army, but on 15 August the regiments were still 2,644 personnel short.
Although Montague estimated that over 3,773 reinforcements could be dis-
patched by 19 August, casualties continued to mount faster that the rate of re-
placement by the No. 2 CBRG.* Infantry reinforcements sent from the United
Kingdom that month numbered 375 officers and 2,831 other ranks." As shown
in detail in Appendix 3, by 31 August, shortages in infantry, other ranks, had
grown to 4,318, and this was after monthly reinforcements had been accepted.
These numbers illustrate that the August replacements did not made a dent in
the overall infantry shortage. 60
The shortage situation reached its nadir on 31 August, when the average
personnel deficit within infantry regiments was 206. On 4 September, there
were only 731 other ranks infantry reinforcements present in the No. 2 CBRG
holdings " From 12 August to 1 September, a total of 4,088 men were remustered
and began training to become qualified infantrymen. This did nothing to solve
the problem quickly, because these personnel had to complete their training
before they could be sent to the front. Figure 2.2 illustrates the infantry, other
ranks, shortage in the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. This formation was the
hardest hit by the failure to rapidly replace losses. The totals were spread among
its nine infantry regiments and one machine-gun battalion, all of which were
largely composed of other ranks infantrymen.
