equipped with self-propelled 40 mm antiaircraft guns. This regiment would be
deployed to provide effective light antiaircraft defence for the divisional area of
operations. It could also be deployed to protect headquarters, assembly areas,
and other points of importance. "B" vehicles consisted of 29 cars and 128 trucks,
of which 36 were the self-propelled mounts for 40 mm antiaircraft guns, and
12 were light artillery tractors. This total was supplemented by thirty trailers
and thirty-eight motorcycles. The attached REME LAA Workshop type "A"
consisted of one officer and twenty-eight other ranks.
Although these war establishment organizational figures set out what the
regiments were authorized to contain under 21st Army Group regulations, reality
in the field could be different. But in the majority of cases, the organization
figures were adhered to. Combat losses often caused temporary organizational
changes, such as the reduction of a squadron to three troops or the disbandment
of an infantry company. Also, command decisions to replace a unit's vehicles
and equipment in the field were often taken before war establishment figures
could be amended. This practice often left units with unauthorized items. These
figures the underscore the significance (or lack thereof) of unit losses presente
in this study.
