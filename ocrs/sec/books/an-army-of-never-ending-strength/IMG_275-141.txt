"Gullachsen shows how the Canadian Army constantly regenerated its
fighting power through prompt replacement of men and weapons lost
during the brutal battles for the liberation of Europe in 1944-45. He has
mined a wealth of information buried deep in the archives to tell a story
essential to understanding how the Canadian forces crushed a supremely
tenacious enemy."
ROGER SARTY, professor of history, Wilfrid Laurier University
An army may march on its stomach, but it needs more than hot dinners
to fight. As Canadians battled through Northwest Europe in the Second
World War, how did they reinforce their front lines? An Army of Never-
Ending Strength provides detailed insight into the administration, structure,
and troop and equipment levels of the First Canadian Army during 1944-45.
Captain Arthur W. Gullachsen demonstrates the army's effectiveness
at reinforcing its combat units and draws a powerful conclusion. The
administrative and logistical capability of the Canadian Army created a
constant state of offensive strength, which made a marked contribution to
eventual Allied victory.
