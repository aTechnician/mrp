Acknowledgments
MANY PEOPLE HAVE contributed to this book. First and foremost, I must thank
my wife, Michele Connor, for her never-ending support for An Army of Never-
Ending Strength. I must also thank the late Brock Millman, who sadly passed
away in 2018. It was his insight that uplifted my spirit when I was unhappy with
the product and pointed me in the direction I needed to go. Next, I must thank
the anonymous reviewers who asked me tough questions during the review
process at UBC Press. These scholars, recruited by editor Randy Schmidt, were
essential to the manuscript editing and revision process. Though I may never
learn who you are, your careful review and blunt suggestions took this manu-
script to another level. My colleague Asa McKercher at the Royal Military College
of Canada helped me identify where the writing could be better. Last but not
least, I must acknowledge the diligent work of Canadian Army staff officers at
the regimental, brigade, division, corps, and army level during the last year of
the Second World War, 1944-45. Without their staff work in the way of carefully
drafted orders, reports, memos, and statistical returns, much of which survives
today at Libraries and Archives Canada, it would have been difficult to accurately
depict the growth of the Army and the challenges it faced in wartime. The First
Canadian Army, colossal in size and strength, is something that is completely
unimaginable in modern Canada, the most unmilitary of nations, safely bound
by oceans. Massively powerful, this army made a significant contribution to the
overall Allied victory in 1945.
