fighting at one hundred metres or less was essential. Advancing against a German
defender with multiple MG 42 machine guns was a challenging situation. Unless
tanks, Wasp II flamethrower carriers, or the heavier British Vickers ,303 water-
cooled machine guns were brought up, the assault could bog down. If he assault
stalled, the chances of casualties multiplied.
German defensive efforts focused on the destruction of dismounted Can-
adian infantry. As a result, the bulk of Canadian infantry casualties occurred
during these types of assaults or when defending against an immediate German
counterattack. While harassing mortar or artillery fire caused a few casualties
each day, the Germans saved the majority of their artillery resources to repulse
Canadian attacks. Casualties often increased rapidly in a very short period of
time because of German indirect fire weapons. Since Canadian attacks were
usually infantry-led and supported by armour and antitank forces, the infantry
nearly always bore the brunt of massed German defensive fires. The Germans
realized that if the infantry were beaten back, any armour present would with-
draw, being naked without infantry support. If the Canadian Army was con-
ducting offensive operations, an infantry regiment might see four to five days
of intensive offensive combat during a thirty-day period. The remainder of the
time would be spent patrolling, conducting training, or in defensive positions.
Casualties during these inactive phases would be light due to the Germans
inability to launch major offensive operations after August 1944."
Though Canadian armour and antitank forces took a subordinate role in
offensive operations, it was important to coordinate them with infantry and
artillery prior to battle to ensure their effective participation. Examples from
Normandy illustrate that the failure to accomplish this task invited disaster.
Attempting to keep in contact with the enemy on s August, the Royal High-
land Regiment of Canada (the Black Watch) advanced on the village of May-
sur-Orne without enough tank and artillery support. On reaching the objective,
it suffered heavy casualties from German mortar, machine gun, and tank fire.
The officer commanding "A" Company was killed, and his company took heavy
losses." The battalion then withdrew back to its start point, St. André-sur-Orne.
This action came directly on the heels of a 25 July reverse on Verrières Ridge,
which decimated the regiment. Casualties totalled inst over three hundred t
In this previous action, the battalion had also attacked without intimate ar-
moured support, attempting to cross a ridgeline devoid of cover. Preparatory
