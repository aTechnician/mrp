168 An Army of Never-Ending Strength
significant equipment challenges during 1944 was self-propelled antitank guns
and flamethrower carriers? This area of weakness was mitigated by the attach-
ment of Canadian armoured regiments to increase its combat power. Apart from
some poor examples of combined arms tactics in July, from August onward
Canadian Armoured Corps support was effective.
In order to survive its reverses of July 1944 and the attrition of August and
October, the division was rebuilt repeatedly in an efficient manner. The monthy
returns from 31 July onward for both heavy weapons and combat "A" vehicles
confirm that the formation was adequately resupplied on a regular basis. The
shortages it had within its infantry regiments in August and September 1944
were of a temporary nature. The infantry losses offate July had occurred quickly
and in such large numbers that the reinforcement system could not keep up
because of its temporarily limited resources. As of October, these personnel
shortages were no longer a major concern. While comparable German forma-
tions were destroyed by attrition and withdrawn for rebuilding, the and Can-
adian Infantry Division stayed at the front.
The grd Canadian Infantry Division was reinforced for part of the Normandy
Campaign with an extra Canadian artillery regiment and had self-propelled
antitank guns attached to its antitank regiment, providing it with more combat
power than a regular Canadian infantry division throughout June and July 1944:
For the duration of its operations in northwest Europe, the division never lacked
a sufficient number of combat "A" vehicles or heavy weapons. Shortages in
personnel did occur, but they were of a temporary nature. Prior to high-intensity
offensive operations, the infantry regiments were always above 8o percent of
their authorized strengths. Figure 9.1 illustrates that the effective strength of the
division never dipped below 17,600 personnel.*
This division lost some of its strength in August 1944, but this was largely
because of factors other than casualties. The division's authorized strength in
summer 1944 was 18,374 personnel. When additional units attached to it during
June and July, it was significantly overstrength. In July, the temporarily attached
19th Army Field Regiment, RCA, which was 647 personnel strong, was detached
from the division. The 4th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RCA, was also re-
organized in summer 1944, reducing its establishment strength from over 866
personnel to 585? As related in earlier chapters, comparable German infantry
formations wasted away to nothing after a short exposure to combat. Figure 9.1
illustrates that the exact opposite occurred with the ard Canadian Infantry
Division. Though the division did suffer significant casualties, it did not lose
as many personnel as quickly as did the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. As a
result, the division was not put in a major personnel deficit situation that the

reinforcement system had to rectify while casualties were continuing to mount.
The 4th Canadian Armoured Division, though containing only a single in-
fantry brigade of three regiments, was arguably the most powerful of the
Canadian formations in northwest Europe. The only time resupply fell short
was in personnel, in August and September 1944. The division's losses shortly
after its combat debut were heavy and occurred with such speed that reinforce-
ment fell behind, because Canadian Military Headquarters in London had
failed to plan for adequate numbers of replacement infantry. These temporary
shortages seriously weakened the infantry component of the division, albeit
for a short period, arguably when it needed all its combat capability. The effect
of this weakness on battlefield performance was mitigated by a disintegrating
enemy in late August 1944.
A successful rebuilding effort coupled with a secondary role during the first
two weeks of Scheldt Estuary fighting allowed the division to regain its strength.
During this period, the division took on reinforcements and conducted training
