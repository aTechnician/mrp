STUDIES IN CANADIAN MILITARY HISTORY
Series editor: Andrew Burtch, Canadian War Museum
The Canadian War Museum, Canadas national museum of military history, has a
threefold mandate: to remember, to preserve, and to educate. Studies in Canadian
Military History, published by UBC Press in association with the museum, extends
this mandate by presenting the best of contemporary scholarship to provide new
insights into all aspects of Canadian military history, from earliest times to recent
events. The work of a new generation of scholars is especially encouraged, and the
books employ a variety of approaches - cultural, social, intellectual, economic, political,
and comparative - to investigate gaps in the existing historiography. The books in the
series feed immediately into future exhibitions, programs, and outreach efforts by the
Canadian War Museum. A list of the titles in the series appears at the end of the book.
