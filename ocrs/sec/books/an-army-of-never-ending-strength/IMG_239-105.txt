The infantry division variant of the RCA Anti-Tank Regiment as of January
1945 was a divisional antitank asset that was deployed to support the infantry
brigades, as illustrated in Table A1.14. As a divisional unit, this regiment was
designed to work in conjunction with the antitank platoons at the infantry regi-
ment level. Unlike other antitank regiments, it contained only three batteries in
early 1945, the first being equipped with towed 17-pounder antitank guns. The
second battery was equipped with self-propelled Valentine Archer 17-pounder
tank destroyers. The third battery contained four troops equipped with
6-pounder towed antitank guns. The regiment also operated Universal Car-
riers, T16 (gun tractor) Carriers, 2-inch mortars, and a single 20 mm antiaircraft
gun. "B" vehicles consisted of twenty-six cars and ninety-one trucks of general
service and specialist types, sixteen of which were artillery tractors. This vehicle
count was supplemented by four trailers and twenty motorcycles. The attached
RCEME LAD type "D" consisted of one officer and forty-six other ranks.

The Canadian Coros-level light antiaircraft role was filled by the October
1944 RCA Light Anti- Aircraft (LA A) Regiment corps troops variant, as illus-
trated in Table Are There were two of these regiments established, one in each
Canadian corps overseas. This regiment could have its assets deployed at critical
Points on the battlefield to bolster the antiaircraft defences of any front-line
unit. It could also be deployed to protect line-of-communication rear-area units,
headquarters, supply dumps, bridges, and other vital points. As of October 1944,
this regiment contained three batteries, each with two troops. One troop was
equipped with self-propelled truck-mounted 40 mm antiaircraft guns, and the
other was towed. "B" vehicles consisted of twenty-six cars and ninety-five trucks,
of which eighteen were the self-propelled mounts for 40 mm antiaircraft guns
and eighteen were light artillery tractors. This vehicle pool was supplemented
by twenty-six trailers and thirty-eight motorcycles. The RCEME LAA Workshop
type "A" personnel consisted of one officer and seventeen other ranks.
