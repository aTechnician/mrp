The infantry reinforcements shortage was particularly difficult for the thre
francophone infantry battalions in northwest Europe. Le Régiment de Maison-
neuve, Le Régiment de la Chaudière, and Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal had all
experienced high losses during the July-August battles in Normandy. By late
August, their losses still had not been replaced. On 6 June, there were only 345
francophone infantry, other ranks, and reinforcement soldiers - or nearly three
infantry companies - within the reinforcement stream in Great Britain. For
three infantry regiments about to be engaged in high-intensity combat. this was
insufficient. On 23 October, despite some reinforcements being taken on, these

On 31 August, the same date that the infantr other ranies situation reached
its low point, an accurate set of casualty projection rates for the Canadian Army
was produced. As shown in Figure 2-3, these new rates were in line with the cost
of warfare in northwest Europe. They accurately indicated the numbers that
should be set aside for monthly reinforcements and that large reserves could
be created to cope with losses in the Canadian Infantry Corps. Sentember

shortage problem in the Canadian Army. The situation improved rabidly but

the battlefield. Throughout the month, a total of 4,720 troops from other trades
began infantry training. As weeks passed, the shortage continued to be re-
duced, and by 24 October it had been reduced to fifty-four soldiers per regi-
ment. But by s November, because of losses in the fighting in the Scheldt, it
had jumped back up to 100 personnel. While this seems high, no infantry
battalion involved in combat operations during the Second World War was
maintained at 100 percent of its war establishment, an impossible task without
daily reinforcements. By November, the number of personnel that had been
remustered was approaching 7,850 troops. At this point, the crisis had passed.
Returns for December reflected that 10,000 soldiers had been remustered.
And what was the quality of the remustered, NRMA, or regular replacements
that reached the infantry regiments after their often long periods spent as re-
inforcements? The stereotype of army unit commanders and senior non-
commissioned officers never being happy with the training standard of any new
replacement soldier is accurate. The oft-recounted story of Ralston questioning
the regimental sergeant major of the 48th Highlanders in Italy, who had com-
plained about reinforcement training standards, is an example. When asked by
Ralston for the exact names of the seventy-two new reinforcements that had
arrived at the regiment, the unit could only provide thirty-two names. All had
