During the brief halt in Dieppe in early September, reinforcements equivalent
to eight new infantry companies reached the and Canadian Infantry Divisions
infantry regiments. Further transfers continued all month. Many of these men
had been remustered from other trades. This compromise solution to the short-
age of readily available other ranks infantry utilized personnel already in the
reinforcement stream to increase the speed in which they would reach their
new units. These personnel often did not have a high level of infantry training
prior to their remustering, and the transformation of a Royal Canadian Artillery
(RCA) antiaircraft gunner to an infantryman could not be accomplished in-
stantaneously. Luckily for the division, combat operations north of Antwerp
did not begin until earty October 1944. Thus by the beginning of the Battle of
the Scheld - operations to clear the approaches to the vital deepwater port of
Antwerp - reinforcements accepted early in the month of September had had
some time to train and acclimatize themselves.

figure ilustrates that despite losses from intensive combat, the znd Canadian
Infantry Divicion actually gained strength. The amount of reinforcements had
been insuicient at times, but their flow to the division had been continuous.
Though there were still some shortages in mid-September, the serious rebuilding
fort launched during the halt at Dieppe had helped the division exceed its July
strength. On o September this strength stood at 988 officers and 17,477 other
ranks, making it very combat capable on the eve of the Battle of the Schelat? As
displayed in Figure 7.2, by September the larger German formation's combat
elements dwindled away to nearly nothing, leaving mainly rear-echelon troops.
With its new strength, the division plunged into combat operations in eastern
Belgium and the southern Netherlands in fall 1944. In late September, initial
operations had begun to clear the area west of Antwerp in preparation for a
drive north on the left flank of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division. The div-
ision crossed the Antwerp- Turnhout Canal on 22 September and regrouped for
an advance north. The eventual goal was clearing the northern bank of the
Scheldt Estuary to free the port of Antwerp.
Following the Falaise Gap battle, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division crossed
the Seine at Elbeuf, operating with parts of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division.
