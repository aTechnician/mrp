by July. This move immediately subtracted its vehicles and weapons from the
division's totals.
As of 31 August, the inventory levels of combat "A" vehicles operated by the
3rd Canadian Infantry Division were satisfactory. 18 A total of 737 "A" vehicles
were present within the division versus its authorized war establishment level
of 707, making it 4 percent overstrength. The division was significantly over-
strength in some "A' vehicles categories, but this was to compensate for short-
ages in other types. For example, of the 120 T16 gun tractor carriers authorized
as antitank gun towers and ammunition carriers, only 13 were present. The non-
vehicle weapons state of the division was also satisfactory. The division con-
tained 569 major weapons systems versus an authorized level of 563, makingit
slightly overstrength in this category. The only significant shortage was in the
area of antitank guns as the division was authorized sixteen of the very effective
17-pounder towed antitank guns, but none had been issued. In their place,
eighteen extra 6-pounders were on strength.
The division was in good shape in comparison to average German infantry
formations. As shown in Figure 6.2, after Normandy, German infantry divisions
had very low strengths compared to their wartime establishments. These German
formations were burned-out shells hecause of nonreinforcement. The Canadian
Army's competent reinforcement-and-replacement systems for personnel,
vehicles, and weaponry had performed to a satisfactory degree. While a complete
British infantry division had to be broken up to re-equip and refurbish others.

So, why, at the height of the summer of 1944 "infantry shortage, discussed
in Chapter 2, were the ard Canadian Infantry Division's infantry brigades in
rather good shape compared to those in other Canadian divisions? The answer
is that apart from a bad mauling during Oneration Spring On 2c Julu the divicion
had successfully accomplished tasks delegated to it in August without sustaining
heavy losses. Such were the fortunes of war. In the period from 9 July to 8
September, some infantry regiments had taken high levels of casualties, but this
had not occurred in a large number of others after se Tul. Had this occurred
the 3rd Canadian Infantry Divicion would have found itselfin a cimilar state to

Despite its weakened state, on 8 August the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division
successfully supported the initial breakthrough of the armoured advance of
Operation Totalize. Later that month, the division conducted a successful assault
crossing of the Laize River at Bretteville-sur-Laize. It then recrossed the same
river at Clair Tizon prior to Operation Tractable:" From 27 July to 16 August,
