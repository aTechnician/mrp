as there was limited contact with the enemy. The opposing German forces in
the Netherlands were weak, lacking the capability to launch sustained offensive
operations. The main German focus on the western front during this time was
its offensive operations in Belgium and Luxembourg, where the largest percent-
age of its divisions and resources were being utilized.

satisfactory at the end of November and beginning of December 1944, indicat-
ing that sufficient reinforcements had been received. For example, on 25
November 1944, the RCAs 6th Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment's strength stood
at 38 officers and 746 other ranks, 97 percent of its war establishment. Heavy
weapons and combat "A" vehicle inventories were also satisfactory. Troops from
2nd Canadian Corps possessed 271 out of an authorized level of 278 combat "A"
vehicles on 30 November 1944.5° This placed the four regiments at 97 percent
of their "A" vehicle war establishments. Nonvehicle equipment levels were also
satisfactory. Eighty heavy weapons systems were on strength against the war
establishment level of seventy-two on 30 November."
