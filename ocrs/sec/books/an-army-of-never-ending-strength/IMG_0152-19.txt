The First Canadian Army was largely inactive during December 1944 and
January 1945, with the result that there was low demand for reinforcements
other than for ongoing nonbattle losses. Reinforcement numbers spiked again
with the resumption of high-intensity operations in February 1945. The Canadian
Army's reinforcement ability was superior to that of the German land forces.
As shown in Figure 1,4, the German Army, Waffen-SS the military branch of
the SS), and Luftwaffe (air force) ground units were bled white in Normandy,
and their losses were not replaced. The two points for every date in the graph
chronicle the gulf between losses and replacements. With new losses occurring
daily, German units on the front line never had a break to build up theirstrength.
The failure to provide a recular fow of replacements to offset losses meant that
units got progressively weaker.
An important question to be addressed definitively is whether the First Can-
adian Army received sufficient replacement personnel to cope with ongoing
battle losses within its formations. Wartime records illustrate that the total
number of reinforcements dispatched to keep units at 100 hundred percent of
their war establishments was at first elance, excessive From August 1944 tO

Armoured Division and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade sustained 28,277
battle casualties. During the same time period, 36,145 Canadian reinforcements
were dispatched to the First Canadian Army. Additional reinforcements were
needed due to losses from other causes, including nonbattle casualties, transfers,
imprisonment, and AWOL cases. These categories combined constituted an
ongoing drain to personnel levels, removing soldiers from units just as effectively
as battle losses.27
In summary, despite its bureaucratic process, the reinforcement system's
production at the CBRG level was continuous, making weekly or twice weekly
deliveries at regimental unit "B" Echelons. It was also flexible and could be
manipulated to increase the size of personnel replacement deliveries, provided
enough replacements were present.
