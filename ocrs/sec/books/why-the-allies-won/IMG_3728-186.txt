EPILOGUE
German and Italian participation was essential. She also needed the indust-
rial potential of the two states to contribute to fuelling the Korean War
boom. During the 1950s the remaining restrictions on industrial develop-
ment imposed on Axis economies in 1945 were lifted, and their popu-
lations rushed for the economic growth they had been starved of for a
generation. As one German observed in 1960: 'The American outlook is
based on enthusiasm for a better standard of living... the fellow who can
figure out how soon he too can own a motor-bike or a Volkswagen won't
dream any longer of the day when there will be a Gauleiter's job [Nazi
provincial leader] opening up in Central Asia . ..% The scramble for
economic success had other causes too. There was no prospect for any Axis
state to improve its lot by reviving pre-war territorial ambitions. Militar-
ism and racism were thoroughly discredited, and the elites turned to more
conventional paths to wealth and success.
This still begs the question of how societies that failed so comprehensively
at the task of waging war have succeeded so dramatically in the economic
contest. No doubt the concentration of national energies on the achieve-
ment of material well-being did owe something to the deliberate choice
made in the immediate post-war years to reject the failed policies of the
I930s and the war. Defeat in war shifted the values and status-systems of
Japanese and German societies to an entirely new footing. Rational, civilian
activities have been adopted because they have brought results: victory for
the United States and Britain in 1945, economic miracles for Germany and
Japan (and Italy too) in the fifty years that followed. In the long term the
country that contributed the most to the
defeat of the Axis, the Soviet
Union, is the one that has lost most. Soviet militarism survived. There was
no economic miracle. The manifest inability of the communist system to
provide what the liberal west could offer, despite the smothering propa-
ganda of socialist progress, eventually locked the Soviet system into a
political dead-end. Its collapse after 1989 was not in any sense a certainty,
but the choices made there after 1945, like Axis choices in the 193os, made a
circle impossible to square. The cost of maintaining the super-power status
and the arms race finally outran the ability of the regime to persuade the
people that the communist new order was worth that cost. The collapse of
the Soviet Union was not caused directly by victory in 1945. The distance of
time is too great for that. But victory proved a poisoned chalice. The Soviet
people did not win freedom or prosperity, but their sacrifices have made it
possible for all the other warring states to enjoy them both.
