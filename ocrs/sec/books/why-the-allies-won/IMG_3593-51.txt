neighbouring Don and South-western fronts were to attack and encircle
German forces, snapping tight the trap that Zhukov had set in September. 25
The Soviet counter-offensive worked like clockwork. Enemy forces were
caught by complete surprise. Although local commanders had observed
Soviet troop movements on the German flanks for some time, more senior
commanders hesitated to pass the news on to Hitler, when victory at
Stalingrad seemed so near. At Hitler's headquarters it was assumed that the
battle for the city had consumed Soviet reserves, and that little was left for an
extensive operation. It was later admitted by Hitler's Chief of Operations,
General Jodl, that this was the 'biggest failure' of German intelligence] The
day before the attack the head of army intelligence on the eastern front,
General Reinhard Gehlen, predicted limited attacks, but would suggest no
date or direction 26 In fact under cover of darkness, cloud and snowfall,
paying close attention to camouflage and the muffling of tank movements,
the Soviet General Staff had built up a force of over i million men, with
almost 14,000 heavy guns and mortars, 979 tanks (mostly the versatile,
well-armed T-34) and 1,350 aircraft. 27 They were grouped on three fronts,
the South-west and Don fronts to the north of German lines, and the
Stalingrad front to the south
and south-east. Facing
them were the
Romanian armies and weaker German reserve divisions. At 7.30 on the
morning of the 19 November the northern fronts began the artillery barrage.
Two hours later Romanian forces were hurled back by a furious onslaught
from three Soviet armies.
For the first time Soviet commanders found
themselves with the opportunity to do what their enemy did so well: to
conduct a large-scale operation with mobile forces in open country,
smashing forward with tanks and aircraft.
Soviet forces made rapid progress. On 20 November the southern armies,
with the less
difficult terrain,
were
unleashed
against more
hapless
Romanians. Large numbers of prisoners, arms and supplies were seized
in the first few days. 'In desperate plight since early morning,' wrote one
unfortunate Romanian in his diary on the 21st. 'We are surrounded. Great
confusion ...
We're
putting
on our best clothes,
even two sets
underclothes. We figure very tragic end in store. 28 He, like thousands of
others, surrendered. Within three days Soviet mobile units reached the Don
river, almost 150 miles from their starting point. So rapid was their progress
that German sentries guarding a vital Don bridge, near Kalach, thought that
approaching Soviet tanks were the next watch, come to relieve them. By the
time they realised their mistake it was too late, and Soviet armoured forces
were free to pour southwards to link up with armies coming the other way.
On 22 November, at Sovetsky, south-east of Kalach, the two forces joined
hands and Paulus was encircled. The whole steppe area in the German rear
