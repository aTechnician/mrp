Some sense of the scale and ferocity of the Soviet-
German war is conveved here as German soldiers cross
a smashed bridge over the Don river in July 1942
through a tangle of broken vehicles.
Right: The performance of the T-34 medium tank was
marred by the lack of radios and a hatch which prevented
all-round vision, clearly visible here. By the time of the
Battle of Kursk in 1943, these deficiencies had been
made good.
Far right: The Soviet counter-offensive relied on large
numbers of rugged, easily maintained weapons. Here the
SU-76 self-propelled gun is in action in the advance into
Prussia in 1945.
