CHAPTER 1 - THE PERIOD BEFORE THE
FiRsT WORLD WAR
The situation is mentioned by
Montgomery in his Memoirs, p. 329. The
battle went on 16-19 October 1813 and
resulted in a decisive defeat of Napoleon.
See Bailey 2004: Field Artillery and
Firepower, p. 177
The role played by the Rocket Troop in
the Swedish Army is presented in Engelskt
ridande raketbatteri under svenskt överbefäl
i kriget 1813-1814. This account was
prepared by the Historical Section of
Swedish Army General Staff and an
original copy in Swedish as well as a
translated copy in English have been
found by the author in the archive of the
Royal Artillery History Trust at the Royal
Artillery Museum at Woolwich Arsenal,
James Clavell Library.
From letter to the author 26 October 2005
in which Major McCleery mentions that
by tradition a toast is proposed in honour
of the King of Sweden and that telegrams
are exchanged with the Swedish Court.

One might wonder what influence on this
development the foremost lady at the
Queen's court had. Her name was Helena
Snakenborg from an estate in Sweden. She
arrived in England together with a Swedish
Princess at the age of 16 and remained
there for the rest of her life. She became a
very close and trusted friend of the Queen.
Her remarkable life story is presented in
the book Helena Snakenborg. En svenska vid
Elizabeth I's hou authored by Gunnar
Sjögren, Askild & Kärnekull 1973.

from 1804 19% of ammunition supply to
guns was of this type, and around 50% to
the howitzers

At an academic lecture in Sweden a
Swedish officer discussed this problem
with rocket fire as compared with
traditional artillery, but he presumed that
one day rockets might come in general
use as a complement to conventional
artillery, as it might be possible to
implement bigger calibres and as it also
will be easier to deploy rocket launchers in
terrain not suitable for ordinary pieces'
Isander (1827). Vol. III-IV, p. 3-4.
Bailey (2004), p. 187.
Counter-Battery fire doctrines existed in
most armies stating the importance of
this task.
One account of the struggle is Hibbert:
The Great Mutiny India 1857.
Harmondsworth, Middlesex Reading
1978.
The 'Sea-Brigade' comprised some 530
men including fifty Marines and they had
a number of ship guns of various calibres
and was attached to a larger formation
under Brigadier Adrian Hope. In his
account Lind af Hageby wrote: 'At last
the day which I had so long looked
forward to arrived, when I was to close in
on the enemy and demonstrate that I was
worth the task of honour to fight for and
under Albion's proud Banner, the on so
many blood-stained battlefields planted
Banner of Victory' [from Swedish]. The
account from his service in the Royal
Navy has the title Minnen fran ett tre-ärigt
vistande i engelsk örlogstjänst 1857-1859
and was published in 1860.

manufactured guns and ammunition
during the war. Most of them were
women. Indeed a remarkable war effort.

The exact number of guns delivered from
USA is uncertain. Other sources claim
800 guns. May it be so, but any way it
was a significant interim solution for the
Royal Artillery.

amongst them General Return of the

the various sources are not fully consistent

correct order of magnitude.
Hughes (1992), p. 178 informs that
around 1,400 carriages of the types Mark
IV and V were at disposal in 1936 for
conversion of 18-pounder guns to 18/25-
nounders. Pemberton (1950) writes on p
12 that around 1,000 guns had been
converted by 1939
