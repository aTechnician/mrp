The correspondence with L van Aardt has
been interesting. He is living in South Africa,
but was brought up in a farmer's family in
Kenya, maybe due to this he was an officer of
King's African Rifles during the war. He served
in Burma as a platoon commander in 11 (East
African Division.
With military historians in the Netherlands
I have had over the years an extensive corre-
spondence, in particular with persons with
special interest in British organisation, equip-
ments and operations in World War II such as:
-Bob Gerritsen (specialist on Operation
Market Garden. Co-author of Arnhem Bridge -
Target Mike One)
-Meulstee, Louis (specialist on British wireless
equipments)
