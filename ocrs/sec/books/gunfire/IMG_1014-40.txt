former in one battery and the latter in the other
During the last few years of the war, when
quite a large number of Medium Regiments
were set up, focus was shifted entirely to the 5.5-
inch gun. Most regiments were equipped with
this gun only, which of course implied many ad-
vantages, not least logistically
Heavy Regiments had during the second
half of the war four batteries. Iwo of them were
equipped with the modernised vintage 7.2-inch
howitzer, the
Other
two had the
modern
American 155-mm gun ('Long Tom'). The
Heavy Regiment had around 780 men, and thus
was the largest type of regiment as far as the
manpower size was concerned. The heavy guns
all required strong six-wheel tractors/trucks.

Table 5-2. It must again be stressed that organ-
isational structures as well as equipment were
changed many times during the war, and local
adaptations had sometimes to be made to meet
specific requirements. However, the illustration
is deemed to fairly well represent the order of
magnitude of the Royal Artillery resources

Corps are included in numbers given.89
From this data we can see that the divisional
artillery
of an infantry
division comprised
around 2,000 men and 400 vehicles. This was
approximately 10% of the division's strength,
also as regards the number of vehicles
In the presentation above communication
equipment has not been included. Neither has it
been shown how the communication function of
the 'indirect fire system' was arranged. These
aspects will now be presented in the following
section with a Field Regiment as the basis for the
discussion
Command Posts must thus be connected by
means of telephone lines or radio to the Iroop
Commanders acting as FOOs in support of an
infantry or armoured company near the front.
The latter must also be connected with their
Battery Commanders as to make it possible to
arrange fire with more guns than those of their
own Iroops, in the first place all the eight guns

Battalion
Artillery Commander was to be
connected to his Battery Command Post; and
preferably also to the Regimental Headquarter
and the Regimental Commander, who normally
was acting as Brigade Artillery Commander in
close contact with the Brigade Commander. At
the next level upwards, communication with the
Divisional Artillery Commander, 'CRA', and his
Headquarters must be arranged. The CRA in
his turn must be able to communicate with the
Corps Artillery Commander, 'CCRA', and so
on upwards.
Once
this

communication
function was ready, the foundation was estab-
lished for concentration of fire on a specific
target from a few guns up to not only the 72 of
the regiment, but also from most guns of the
Corps or even an Army, which meant several
hundreds and even more. Douglas Goddard
wrote about the importance of this communica-
tion system function in 1944:
There is no doubt that the tremendous firepower
available to the FOO's was entirely due to the
efficiency of the wireless communications at
all levels 90
Which were then the resources available for
making this happen? Basically the types of
resource were four

When the regiment had been deployed after a
completed march and was ready for firing, it
was important to establish one or several com-

feasible when the technical options had broken

other, unexpected events could cause interrup-
