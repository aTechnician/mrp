A few observations suggesting that the
battery did not have the 25-pounder
Mark II, the 'real 25-pounder', but the
Mark I version, i.e. the 18/25-pounder are
the following:
— We have seen that only a very limited
number of gun carriages had been
delivered to the Royal Artillery in March
1940:
- The war diary of the actual unit. 51
Field Regiment RA, says nothing of
rearmament to the new gun. The
regiment prepared for transport from its
quarters in the last week of March and
embarked troop carriers
s at the beginning
of April, obviously with the intentions to
NOTES
get it engaged in Norway early in April
had not the Germans forestalled British
plans by invading the country on 9 April.
It seems unlikely that the regiment would
have had time for rearmament, undertake
necessary training etc. under these
circumstances;
- The war diary of 203 Battery RA has
no indication that new guns had been
transported to Norway. In a document
about equipment transported to Norway
it is said that it was 25-pounders and 25-
pound ammunition, but as we know the
18/25-pounder often was called just the
*25-pounder;
- In General Auchinleck's report from
the campaign it is specified that guns
taken back to England were 18/25-
pounders and, furthermore, that the
British left 4000 shells for 18/25-
pounders, when the forces were
evacuated.

Auchinleck writes about the postponement
in his report (op. cit. Not 254, p. 26): The
original programme of evacuation was
timed to begin on the night 2nd/3rd June,
but was postponed for 24 hours at the
urgent request of Sir Cecil Dormer [British
Ambassador to Norway] in order to enable
the Norwegian Government to try to
implement the so called "Mowinckel Plan"
through the Swedish Government and so
secure that Narvik should become a
neutral area under Swedish protection. In
view of the probability of heavy enemy air
attacks on Harstad I agreed to this
postponement with great reluctance?
268
In the plan all allied units had been
divided into detachments of 150 men
each. By this everyone could see from the
plan which night they were to leave
269
The war diary of 203 Battery RA (WO
168/49) gives many details and time
schedules about the evacuation of the
battery.

that a pincer operation against the Middle

The name came from one of the first
officers commanding such a battle group
Major General Jock Campbell, originally
a Gunner. He was one of only three
Gunners awarded the Victoria Cross in
World War II. He was killed in a car
accident a few weeks after having
received this award of honour. Campbell
is said to have explained that the wrong
employment of artillery was just due to
severe shortage of artillery.
