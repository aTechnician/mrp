The end of the battle and evacuation
The final phase of the battle can be said to have
begun during the evening of 22 September when
the Poles made their first attempt to cross the
river Rhine. This was followed by two more
crossings the following two nights. On 23 and 24
September
several brigade
attacks
on Elst
(between Nijmegen and Arnhem) were also
launched. Artillery was really busy on those days.
The fact that the Operation Market Garden was
on its way to a failure was as yet not on the
minds of the gunners.

command of Captain Trotman and was never

Captain 'Zeke' Rose of 112 Field Regiment took
up a position in F Troop command post 13
Battery RA] in the porch of the church where he
had a view across the open flats to the east.
Through the morning, he directed fire from his
Regiment's guns and the Division's artillery on to
visible enemy targets and others that were called
for by other observers. After midday, while
standing in the church porch identifying targets
with Lieutenant Moore [Troop Leader], it was
unfortunate that, after such a brave effort to reach
the bridgehead, he was hit and fatally wounded
by machine gun fire
During the final days the whole 1 Airlanding
Light Regiment RA had as we have seen been
deployed down at Oosterbeek Church (see Map
21-4) where they with efficient firing had
stopped numerous attacks on different parts of
the perimeter. Towards the end this became
more and more difficult and eventually the
regiment had to concentrate on defending its
own positions. The gunners were all the time
exposed to frequent attacks from infantry, tanks
and assault guns, not to mention artillery and
mortar shelling
Before leaving the besieged, we must note
that besides the light regiment the two anti-tank
batteries made invaluable contributions with
their shells during the hard close fighting along
streets and in the gardens. Neither my stone
mortars of the airborne units be forgotten. Anti-
tank guns and mortars had a most important
role without which the perimeter could not have
held out for so long. It is, however, beyond the
scope of this book to discuss this in detail.
When a forceful crossing of river Rhine
from the South could not be done in time,
General Horrocks
was forced to order the
remnants of the
1st Airborne Division to
evacuate to the southern side of the river. In the
morning of 25 September, his order was passed
on by the commander of the 43rd (Wessex
Division, Major General Thomas, to General
Urquhart at his headquarters at Hartenstein:
'BERLIN TONIGHT! This was around 10 a.m.

southern side of the river 130 Infantry Brigade
now was in charge
This brigade had been planning for an
assault crossing and establish planning second
bridgehead at Renkum a shorment once down-
'BERLIN TONIGHT' - ARNHEM
stream from Oosterbeek. This was now cancelled.
According to General Urquhart's plan the
evacuation was to commence at 10 p.m. and be
concluded by first light the next morning (26
September). The soldiers should form up in
groups of 14 men, equivalent to the capacity of
assault boats to be used, and move silently down
to the shore of the river and to wait there for
their turn to cross. Their
shoes should be
wrapped with material to make their movement
as soundless as possible. The whole evacuation
was to start with groups from the northern part
of the perimeter; and the
final groups
withdraw were the gunners and the Lonsdale
Force', already in positions close to the river.
Selected glider pilots were ordered to recon-
notre the footpaths to be followed so that enemy
positions were avoided. These would be marked
with white strips from parachutes in order to
make it easier to follow in the dark. It would be
seen that this was far from easy and some got
lost or captured by the Germans.
Left behind were the wounded who could
not walk. They were supported by medical
doctors and orderlies who voluntarily stayed to
look after them. There are numerous stories
written and told as to how the evacuation was
done. Many assault boats were shot to pieces
with many men drowned as a consequence.
Many tried to swim across the river in the cold
water, which certainly not was easy due to the
strong current. Many swimmers died unfortu-
nately. Others were hit by enemy bullets from
machine guns and other weapons.
The evacuation must, however, be regarded
as a success. One must admire the exhausted
and shabby soldiers, who managed to get down
to the river without panic or lack of discipline
and wait there patiently for their turn to cross to
the southern shore in unsafe small boats, often
exposed to enemy bullets. Reports and accounts
over the years have quoted various numbers of
those evacuated. The latest and most authorita-
tive figures are given in Margry (2002) 413Не
Gives the following numbers of men evacuated:

In total

2,398
Some 300 men had to be left on the northern
river shore. Many of them were taken care of by
the Dutch Resistance and were hidden by them.
In a spectacular secret
evacuation on 20
October, which was coordinated with allied units
on the 'Island', another 140 men would be saved
across the river by means of assault boats
assembled at the place.
How had the gunners contributed to
making the evacuation possible?
After the breakout in the south, the artillery
had been dispersed along almost the entire
'Club Route' but had later become more con-
centrated. 153 Field Regiment RA had crossed
river Waal on 21 September and deployed just
north of the Nijmegen road bridge. It has not
been possible to get it confirmed, but it seems
probable that its 129 Battery RA crossed over
the night before. This regiment would anyway
return back southwards in the evening of 22
September and did not take part in the final
fighting on the 'Island'. But this is what all the
regiments of the 43rd (Wessex) Division did.
They deployed on the 'Island' beginning in the
morning 23 September. The situation then was
such that they first had to deploy just one or
two kilometres northwest of the road bridge at
Nijmegen. From these positions they could
not reach
the Oosterbeek perimeter, but
played an
important role
supporting the
attacks by 129 and 214 Infantry Brigade to
capture Elst
and establishing a stop for
German infiltration further up the 'Island'.
There they had to undertake extensive firing
right from the beginning, but on the 24th
these regiments could at last redeploy near
Valburg, which meant that the range to the
perimeter now was reduced to a comfortable
7-8km.
On 22 September, two batteries from 147
Field Regiment RHA moved in with their
'Sexton' SP guns. They first deployed near Lent
and the following day further to the West, at
Slijk-Ewijk. 431 Battery RA from this regiment
deployed on 24 September just south of Valburg.
511 Battery RA was assigned to support 43 Re-
connaissance Battalion (reinforced with the
motor battalion of 8 Armoured Brigade) which
was given the task to protect the western flank of
the 43rd (Wessex) Division. It deployed near the
village Andelst about 4km west of Valburg, where

during 23-24 September had
deployed its three field regiments.
