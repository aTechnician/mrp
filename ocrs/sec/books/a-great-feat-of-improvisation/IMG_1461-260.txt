A Great Feat of Improvisation
BSD firing their Bren guns until the water reached the decks, 205 whilst 1 HRS claimed that 'all
the automatic weapons in action on the Lancastria with one exception, were manned by HKS
personnel. The exception was one RAF Lewis gun ... The action of these Guns Teams was
exemplary and would have done credit to veteran troops' 206
In spite of the sinking of the Lancastria and damage to other ships, 42,000 personnel were
evacuated from Saint Nazaire in less than 48 hours, a most creditable feat which has mainly
been forgotten. 207
The plan during 15-18 June to recover vehicles and equipment was thwarted
by the impossibility, within the timeframe, to sail appropriate ships.
Hundreds of vehicles
including specialist equipment such as workshop lorries had to be abandoned, although often
destroyed or rendered unfit for immediate use.
Several hundred tons of ordnance tools and
miscellaneous stores, 3 x 25 pounder guns and radar equipment were however, brought to UK. 208
The evacuation from St Nazaire in the period 16-18 June was the largest after Dunkerque,
with 57,200 personnel being recovered. Most of these soldiers were GLOC troops and AASF
personnel.
Commandant Force K6, in his After Action Report, credits OIC Movement
Control at Saint Nazaire, an infantry officer, Major Richard Ware MC of the Durham Light
Infantry,209 for keeping a close grip on operations, stating, Without his careful organization the
embarkation might well have developed into a rabble,210 a short sentence in a war diary thus
quietly understating the calm demeanour of another forgotten officer, whose actions enabled the
BEF to reach England.
Equally, there were other successes. 31,360 personnel were evacuated from Cherbourg and
21,474 from Saint Malo without loss of life or vessels, by enemy action. 211 Other units were
fortunate to escape through the incredible gallantry and sea-faring professionalism of the
mainly unsung heroes of the Merchant Marine, bringing with them precious military materiel.
10th Royal Hussars were delayed at Brest by aerial mines, which the Luftwaffe had deployed
into the shipping channel and the French naval authorities had yet to clear them. The skipper
of a rusty old cargo vessel 212 had however, taken bearings on the mines as they fell into the
water and offered to lead the ship, the SS Manx Maid, in which the unit was embarked, to the
open sea. After the Manx Maid cleared the channel unscathed, the soldiers gave his ship and
205 118836 Second-Lieutenant J C Medlicott-Vereker RASC was awarded the MC.
Durrant both received the MM for their actions.

209 After the evacuation Richard Fenwick Ware was promoted to command 11th LI, which was deployed
to Iceland as part of 70th Brigade. Ware also commanded 16th DLI during operations in Tunisia in

led die-drillers, the acquisition of machine tools, the diversion of French aircraft purchased

itzerland by commercial air charter.
Another long forgotten aspect of the evacuation from France was the departure of the
onel and equipment of the Marseilles Sub-Area, which was, despite the best efforts of
mander, Brigadier Hawes, 22 a shambles that could have easily been avoided with clear
recion from HQ LOC. 222 In the light of events in Northern France and the increasing
