BEF, in the period 19- 26 May, before Operation DYNAMO' commenced, 21,410 Army and
RAF personnel, 4,992 casualties and 1,534 Allied soldiers and refugees totalling 27,936 people
had been landed at Dover, Folkestone, Newhaven and Southampton.+ This activity was a most
valuable prelude to DYNAMO, the most famous of the evacuation operations, which recovered
the BEF and later Allied Forces from the port of Dunkerque and the neighbouring beaches to
the East-North-East. Operation CYCLE was successful in evacuating the majority of troops
from the base around Le Harve, including 154th Brigade but the attempt to lift the main
body of 51st (Highland) Division and additional units, from Saint Valery-en-Caux, was, with
