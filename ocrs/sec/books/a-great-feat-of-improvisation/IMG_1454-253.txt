A Great Feat of Improvisation
Waste and Misuse
Completely forgotten has been the dedicated work of the RAOC GHQ Salvage Unit (GSU)
that scoured abandoned camps and dumps for ordnance stores, where evidence was quickly
found of 'the most appalling waste and misuse of material', including using blankets to pad
trenches and to fill sandbags instead of earth.87 The commandant of Force K6,88 was 'appalled'
by the quantity of materiel that was abandoned to the enemy, describing the failure to issue and
execute clear orders for recovery or destruction as 'foolhardy ' 1 General Base Depot at Forges
les Eaux was identified as a classic example of failure in this respect, with over 1,000 tons of
ordnance stores abandoned with no attempt to recover any items.' The depot was planned
to have accommodation for up to 15,000 personnel but the GSU estimated that tentage and
accommodation stores for 30,000 had been hoarded, along with so much clothing that in some
of the stores it was two feet deep, and along with the ration stores, had been thoroughly looted.?1
Such failure reflected very poorly upon the BEE, it was certainly not the action of a professional
Army.
Formed at Camp 13 Rouverary, the GSU consisted of four companies consisting of a total 12
officers and 324 Other Ranks (ORs) recruited from the Base Ordnance Workshop, Advanced
Ordnance Workshop, Advanced Ordnance Depot and 2 BOD.2 Resourced and organized
to operate 24 hours a day, in the first week of June, the unit salvaged 350 tons of stores and
equipment dispatching the stocks in 50 railway trucks to 1 BOD at Nantes.
The companies
worked in two shifts.
During the day, stores were collected by 20 x 15 cwt Bedford rucks
from the camps to assembly points from which, in the dark hours, 20 x 3 ton RASC lorries
transported the equipment to nominated railheads for loading to rail wagons.?" Materielincluded
accommodation stores, tents, blankets, uniforms, anti-gas clothing web equinment. bavonets
and scabbards, plus RE stores, a 6-inch howitzer and three gun limbers4 Also recovered, was
the equivalent of 34 railway wagons of similar equipment, which had to be stored in Nissen huts
at the assembly points of Forge les Eaux and Rouveray because there was no WMT to transfer
the assets to a railhead.?5
A further 700 tons of stores and 500 tents had to be left at the various sites because it was
necessary to withdraw from them but not before the GSU had transferred between 80-100 tons
of NAA FI stocks from the supply depot at Formery to the EFI Arca Controller at Forge.? Such
actions assisted the EFI, given the significant losses of military stores, to recover, mainly from
the Nantes area, over 7,000 tons of stocks, including sports equipment, tobacco, cigarettes, tea

and found passage for himself and the EFI's money on the small coaster SS Rhineland'os to
Amouth, accompanied by 36 soldiers and seven nurses. 14 In a more daring escape, a sergeant
staurant manager and three soldiers were captured at Abbeville and imprisoned in the EFI
kien with no uniforms. Under the cover of darkness, wrapped in blankets, they collected the
ash and books before escaping. 105

it was a concerted effort to recover conventional munitions stocks from the BADs, although
