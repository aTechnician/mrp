Without Liability to Congestion
The BE Land and Air Components, and the AASE, required thousands of gallons of fuel
per day to operate. When mobile, the combat formations of the Land Component consumed
ner 30,00 gallons" per day," the Air Component approximately 27,276 gallons on high
airty levels and the AAS on a maximum effort strike mission, 38,000 gallons, although
Sid consumption figures for the two RAF elements never exceeded 27,000 gallons per day
defore the ground campaign started in May 1940. Much of this fuel was delivered to the corps
we and the airfields by rail, mostly in cans, although road tanker bulk capability did exist at
BeLine and Rail Tank Cars (RTC) could be used to supply some airfields from a rail spur or
