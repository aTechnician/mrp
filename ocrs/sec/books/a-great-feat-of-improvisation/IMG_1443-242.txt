A Great Feat of Improvisation
Fear of German collaborators in civilian clothes or British Army uniforms conducting sabotage
and subversion was rife during the campaign," an environment succinctly captured by the CO"7
of the TA unit tasked with denial and demolition, the Kent Fortress Royal Engineers:98 It
must be appreciated that the area was flooded with fifth columnists, spies and other enemy
agents. Parachutists were captured and shot, and rumour was rife sedulously fostered no doubt
by the Boche." Hence it was not really surprising that everyone was suspicious of the rest of
humanity? 100 Quite whether every instance of sabotage and Fifth Column activity reported
was accurate is open to conjecture but the war diaries in some cases are specific about the
incidents. 01 1 OFP for example, detained 'many' suspected espionage agents in Marcq a town
to the North-East of Lille and, in accordance with instructions, handed them over to the French
Gendarmerie, 02 whilst I Corps SRH Detachment RAOC recorded SAA fire through the
windows of the unit billets103.
The detachment also handled a suspected spy in British Army
uniform at Templeuve who claimed to be a RE officer who had been given orders to report to
the War Office with all speed and needed transport to reach a Channel port without delay, the
investigation discovering that his case was genuine. 104
In the circumstances therefore, it is not surprising that there are references in BEF unit
war diaries of soldiers witnessing the lynching, in French towns and villages, of civilians in
suspected of being spies, saboteurs or members of the Fifth Column. Inevitably the logisticians
were involved in some of the darker aspects relating to these activities. 5 Group AMPC, in
addition to its labouring tasks in unloading ammunition and 100 tons of explosives from a ship
in Boulogne Harbour, 105 deployed its soldiers in a combatant role during which a detachment
assaulted a house inside the perimeter from which the Pioneers were receiving SAA fire. Several
96 Concern about the activities of the Fifth Column and German collaborators are an underlying feature
of the entries in unit war diaries. That of 156 Transportation Stores Company for example, is replete
with vehicle registration marks
and descriptions of stolen Belgian and French cars and lorries, which
