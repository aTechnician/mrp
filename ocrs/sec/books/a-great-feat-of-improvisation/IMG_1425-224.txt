A Great Feat of Improvisation
P15.1 Ramping It Up. During the deployment and the campaign, the RCCs were often tasked
with constructing improvised rail loading ramps, which were critical to effective and efficient rail

successful build at Longmoor in 1937. (WDLMRC: DRMC/V1/004)
At Vellerois-Le-Bois, the RAOC officer in charge of the party?" resorted to using an armed
escort commanded by Conductor Hawley to unpick the traffic chaos at the station, enforcing
order at the point of a bayonet and rifle in order to enable trains to continue their journeys. At
a location approximately 14 miles North-North-East of Besancon, this intrepid rail expedition
ended. A Luftwaffe aircraft dropped a bomb on a 300 mm rail mounted artillery piece killing
two French soldiers and blocking the line, and whilst the BEF train was stationary, it was
rammed in the rear by the locomotive of the following train, although fortunately the speed was
low and there were no casualties from the collision. The logisticians dismounted and a plan
was discussed, which involved marching South to Marseilles but close to Swiss frontier, thus
enabling internment in Switzerland as a last resort. The stores wagons on the train were fired to
destroy equipment and burn the Imprest account funds storehe fames were extinguished after
Major Milnes. TNA CAB 106/234: Saar Force - Ordnance Services.
