increased in the range 12 to 34 percent. For personnel proceeding on leave the reduced services
and longer times often made their trip home a slow and difficult task. 36
There were improvements as the schedules bedded-in but the severe winter weather in
January and February 1940 was a significant problem, which generated a consequential and
extensive backlog of traffic.
As an illustration of the chaos, which resulted from the heavy
snowfall during the weekend of 27-29 January 1940, there was widespread disruption of services
across the country, involving in some areas, a complete stoppage of passenger and goods traffic.
Overcrowding was another major and constant issue, with an extreme event occurring at
Kettering in Northamptonshire when a lady in a carriage was taken ill, and then died. 95 people
had to be ordered, by the stationmaster, to leave the coach, so her body could be removed." At
nearly every station BEF personnel would see a large poster of a soldier asking passengers, Is
Your Journey Really Necessary?'38 Obviously, every serviceman or woman on leave would have

For some soldiers living on Off-Islands around the Kingdom, such as Skye, the Shetlands and
the Isles of Scilly, the end of the rail journey meant the start of another adventure." From the
station there would be a short trip to the quay, followed by a sea crossing, which was often longer
than the one they had experienced across the English Channel, with of course the possibility
of torpedo attack from U-Boats, or being mined. On arrival on the island, they might have to
endure another sea journey to reach another Isle, and then walk from the jetty to their home.
Those travelling to the North of Scotland were faced with similar difficulties, not only because of
