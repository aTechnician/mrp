Weights & Measures
The official Weights and Measures of the British Army of 1939-1940 were Imperial and not
Metric, although in France, the logisticians were often accounting in Metric, especially in the
procurement of goods and services from French sources or if they were relaxing in an estaminet.
Whilst logistics in the British Army of the 21st Century is almost entirely enacted in Metric,
I have chosen to retain the historical Imperial because the contemporary publications and
references use the system and referral to them requires no conversion. For those who prefer a
Metric output, the following conversions may be used:
Pounds to Kilogrammes: x 0.453592
Tons to Tonnes: x 1.01605
Gallons to Litres: × 4.54609
Yards to Metres: x 0.914
Miles to Kilometres: x 1.60934
Acres to Hectares: x 0.405
Fahrenheit to Celsius: -32 then multiply by 5 then divide by 9.
A hundred-weight (cwt) was a common measure of the time and is 112 pounds.
Time is denoted within the 24 hour clock, for example 2000 (8 pm).
