A Great Feat of Improvisation
they were greatly assisted by the establishment of the Army Comforts Depot (ACD)* in a
Territorial Army Drill Hall in Reading. 43
To provide a feel for the work, on 14 February 1940, GHQ demanded from ACD, five cases
of gum-boot socks, 18 cases of scarves, 18 of socks, 19 each of mittens and pullovers, and 22
of balaclavas. From a previous stock receipt, the ACD was able, on 22 February, 1 to issue 47
cases of balaclavas and 47 of scarves, to AMPC companies, units whose soldiers spent most
of their time outside on construction or support tasks. Tobacco supply frequently appears as
an issue in unit war diaries. 1 AA Brigade Company RASC reported a shortage of cigarettes
on 13 November 1939 but was fortunate to have received a gift of 1,900 on 15 November from
the Overseas League Tobacco Fund.46
The PSS officers would certainly have been delighted
to learn of another positive outcome from the entry in the war diary of 2 Division CRASC,
which highlighted the success of the PSS project: 'Increased quantities of comforts for the
troops are now being received and include wireless sets, books and gifts of cigarettes?" The
co-ordination of comfort provisioning did not however, always run efficiently, which, given the
rapidly expanding force was perhaps not surprising. Force K6 is an example. The PSS laboured
intensively to enhance the comforts for this Indian Army contingent but was later surprised to
discover that the Indian Comforts Fund was providing support on a private basis and the PSS
could stand easy on the subject.48 Whilst intended to improve soldiers' well-being, the issue
of woollen comforts did not always create the harmony intended. In a report on morale from
postal censorship in the period 14-28 January 1940,4 during a particularly harsh winter in
which the temperature fell to -20°C, troops in several battalions" complained that they were
unable to wear on duty, the balaclavas that had been sent to them.
Strong words were directed
by soldiers at the regimental chain of command for enforcing this rule at a time of immense
hardship in the field. That the AG Staff officers were able to have some direct visibility of unit
morale and by implication, the decisions of the command structure, by examining mail, is an
interesting subject, the effects of which are worthy of study."" How many commanding officers

The ACD was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel R W Phillips and staffed by volunteers plus thre
members of the AS. The ACD received a visit by Her Majesty the Queen in 1944 but was transferio
to Didcot under KAO control in Mav 1945.
Phillips commanded it for the entire conflict but died
in mid-1945. For a short brief on its history and operation, see, WOOH, Army Welfare, pp. 14-16.
