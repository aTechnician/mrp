A Great Feat of Improvisation
there were many refugees living in wooden shanties near to the depot. 51 The stocks at 4 POLD
at Moult-Argences were being cleared at a rate of 800 tons per day mainly to 2 POLDD,152
although by 15 June only 46 personnel remained at the site with the sole task of supplying
petrol to Beauman Division.
The French authorities accepted responsibility for the remaining
stocks but were unable to provide a unit to take over the inventory and under orders from HQ
Beauman Division 53 the 1,000,000 gallons plus of petrol and 60,000 gallons of lubricating oil
were fired. 154
Unwise to Overrule Them
Concurrently, the arrival of 52nd (Lowland) Division, a component of the 2nd BEF, provided
the LOC Area DDST staff with an additional problem because the formation's petrol and
supply companies had been dispatched to arrive at the tail of the division, an unfortunate
outcome because it tasked to move as quickly as possible from the SPOD.155 WMT from local
resources were thus placed under command of 52 Division CRASC and lorries from the VRD
were allocated to 157th Brigade, which was in the vanguard. 156
In addition, the War Office
directed LOC Area to form the 3rd Line Ammunition Sub-Park from in-Theatre resources.157
It proved impossible to generate one from a Reserve MT Company and after five days of staff
work, 10 TCC RASC was assigned to the task, 158 thereby demonstrating the absolute need for
flexibility in the utilization of WMT.
As the operational focus moved to the West of France, with evacuation and denial operations
being increasingly driven at pace, plans were maturing for the establishment of a re-located Base
at La Rochelle to support the 2nd BEF, the War Office dispatching a reconnaissance team on
12 June.!59 The outline plan included a BOD, BAD and a Base Ordnance Workshops and was
sufficiently advanced for 1 BOD to be instructed to commence packing 50 percent of war and
MT stores with a completion date of 22 June, the order being confirmed in writing on 13 June
from the QMG at the War Office to GOC LOC Area 60 The DDST Staff exposed the key
freedoms and constraints in developing this proposal during a conference with the War Office
reconnaissance team led by the DOMG BEF Brigadier Parminter'61 at HQ LOC at Le Mans

Run Rabbit Run
on 14 June; the scenario did not have much to commend it, with few of the former and rather too
many of the latter. 62 The only asset immediately available was a field bakery, although its third
section required equipment. 30 percent of the GLOC WMT had been lost to enemy action
or accidents, with much of the balance requiring maintenance, repair or reorganization. In
ummary, all the key units needed to be imported from the UK, including a BSD, HRS, VRD,
Advanced MTSD, LOC MT Company and a Reserve MT Company. 63
The proposal to form a new Base undoubtedly disrupted stock evacuation operations but
ith orders to evacuate the 2nd BEF, the scheme was dropped, and the party focused upon
sisting executing the evacuation of the reconnaissance team, advance parties
and other
personnel through La Pallice, the port of La Rochelle.
Apart from withdrawing material
Go later evacuation to the UK, the concept made absolutely no sense because it was in the
posite direction to the forces deploying into the Cherbourg peninsula, whilst the sea voyage
com UK was much longer than to either Brest or Saint Nazaire. 2,500 RAF personnel were
embarked on two requisitioned colliers, one of which was only partially discharged, together
ith a number of military personnel, 10-12 tons of special RAF ammunition, 64 four motor
is plus ancillary artillery equipment, 65 leaving on the docks four 3.7-inch HAA guns, four
A Bofors and 350 to 400 vehicles, all of which required cranes to load them aboard ships.166
ne pressure to depart in short order was driven by the growing concern that the impending
enco-German Armistice might result in the internment of all British service personnel by the
ench, a decision supported by the Howard Committee, 67 although officers on the Royal Navy
stroyer HIMS Mackay arrived on 19 June and arranged for the evacuation of 4,000 Poles on 20
ne, with some stragglers also being collected on 22 June 68
Additional diversions included the issue of weapons and equipment to the various ad hoc
