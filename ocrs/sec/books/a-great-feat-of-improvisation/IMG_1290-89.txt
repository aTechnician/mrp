four arrived, having being left in the open on the dockside. 108 Sometimes however, the industry
of the bakers, often working in austere field conditions, was not supported by the distribution
system, with bread arriving at the Supply Railheads (SH) in poor condition, 4 Divisio
CRASC reporting that stocks received at Doullens were 'crushed, sodden and in some cast
in burnt condition'109 and on another occasion, the division only received 7,000 Ib of its daily
11,000 lb allocation, the discrepancy only being discovered when the pack train was unloaded,
leaving the divisional Supply Staff Officer insufficient time to supplement the shortage through
local purchase.l10 The shortage of bread was however, not the only ration problem in Februany
1940 because fresh meat was arriving in 'a very a dirty and filthy condition' caused by an acute
shortage of protective brown hessian wrappers in the UK. 111
Ordnance Services
Ordnance Services within the Base were a critical component of the BEF's logistic capability
and the deployment plan allocated the following assets to it, although during the first the ti
four months of months of the operation, the improvised nature of the units did not generate the
military efficiency and effectiveness required to prosecute resilient operations.

GHQ faced in bringing order to the delivery of Ordnance Services to the BEF. The movement
of the CH mobilization equipment to France was a complete shambles, with stores in transit
for more than two weeks compounded by considerable pilfering, which was a headache for many
units Of the 16 stationery boxes dispatched from Aldershot for the Ordnance Directorate, only
four trived in the BEF Assembly Area and each of these was filled with millboards. Inevitably
paning was disrupted whilst office machinery, such as typewriters and copiers were hired,
funiture borrowed and stationery purchased, whilst the inadequate office accommodation was
never properly resolved 14
There were however, much greater challenges to be overcome, which had been created
by a combination of weak pre-var planning, a failure to ensure the existence of coherent
coordination with the Host Nation and unstructured deployment. It became rapidly clear to
Director Ordinance Services that the covered storage space required for a BODis supporting
the maintenance of a twelve division motorized force had been significantly underestimated,
