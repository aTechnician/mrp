ammunition." On 12 May, Movement Control at Le Harve issued instructions for 120 tons
of Naval Expeditionary Force stores to be out-loaded by road? to Mommenheim, a small town
North-North-West of Strasbourg, with the balance of 30 tons being despatched by rail under
naval guard on 16 May? The war diary does not elaborate on either manifest but highlights a
visit by Rear-Admiral Fitzgerald to inspect the road out-load so whatever the cargo was it must
have been of some significance and sensitivity.?5
As plans developed, some Army weapons were deployed to other BADs whilst HQ BAFF
arranged the out-load of some of the air delivered SW to locations near to the operational
airfields to create a rapid response to any German gas attack. The stocking of offensive gas
air-delivered munitions for operations in Europe, although originally the logistic SW main
effort, had suffered a delay in August 1939, when stocks had been dispatched to Egypt, but
by March 1940, despite the many challenges, the BAFF stock inventory started to rise. In
particular, 250 1b LC Bomb reserves were complete, and the SCIs stock position positive. Only
in 30 lb LC Bomb reserves did the Air Staff have cause for concern. The table below illustrates
the gains made in the planned stock positions for munitions held in France.
