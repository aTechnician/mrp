by the Lone Interieure, through a series of traffic and regulating posts in each French Milita

who were responsible for traffic control and signposting, although in the ports, Base and stagi
areas, the BEF's provost companies directed UK military convoys and erected addition
signage. 158
Initially, there were joint Anglo-French military traffic controls but the ho

the River Somme, the Zone d'Armee was an area of controlled road movement and whilst th
BEF was responsible for its movements within allocated routes, French Army supply trai

One of the key issues during the road moves was the poor reliability of the thousands ou

thoroughly unimpressed by the MT arrangements:
The transport was inadequate and completed on mobilisation by vehicles requisitioned
from civilian firms. Much of the transport of my division consisted of civilian vans
and orries from the towns of England; they were in a bad state of repair and, when my
division moved from the ports up to its concentration area near the French frontier, the
countryside of France was strewn with broken down vehicles. 167
Viscount Gort was regrettably rather less well informed about this failure in a critical logistic
capability in his Command, writing in his despatches, 'Breakdowns and accidents were few. 168
The history of 208 Field Company RE summarized the logistic issue generated by the
impressment solution: "The stores situation was somewhat aggravated because the vehicles
which had been issued were all of different makes, types and dates of manufacture, the spares
to be carried were thus multiplied by the need for a provision to be made for each vehicle rather
than a percentage to cover all vehicles of one make. Inevitably, with so many vehicles on
the French roads,70 driving on the right-hand side with inexperienced and sometimes tired
drivers, accidents were inevitable. 2 Docks Group suffered an early casualty when Captain
Reginald Tucker who was a commercial railway engineer was killed in a motorcycle accident, 171
whilst Driver Arthur Butler of 76 Company RASCI was killed near Evreux, en-route to the

have resulted in a serious incident caused by the enthusiastic French welcome. Travelling along
the MSR between Belleme and Mortagne, to the Concentration Area, flowers and fruit were
showered upon the troops! when an apple hit a driver square between the eyes, causing him to
lose control of the vehicle, which then travelled into a ditch. Given the circumstances, it was
surprising that the largest motorized movement that the British Army had ever undertaken176
did not result in much greater numbers of casualties both military and civilian, Gort noting fairly
