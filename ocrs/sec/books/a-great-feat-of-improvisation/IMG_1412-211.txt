Storing Gas in France
The deployment and storage of SW did not generally follow the GLOC procedures, which
had been established to support the BEF. Storage in the Main Base Areas and movement by
rail to the corps areas created unease in the War Office, which perceived difficulties in rapidly
extracting the weapons from Theatre. I+ was therefore decided to store most of them in the
Advanced Base Area using a short sea crossing and from the few records that remain, it would
appear that all the REF' SW were shinned from Newharon in Susser to Focan in France and
the SS Clewbay, a steam collier of 645 tons GRT, undertook most of the voyages. 5s
