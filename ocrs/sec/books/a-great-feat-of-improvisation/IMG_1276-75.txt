Many units had a relatively benign experience during the deployment, 2nd Royal ultr
recorded that:
After a very rough crossing to Cherbourg, and several hours spent in a French train,
we arrived in the early hours of the morning of 7th October at the small village of
Asnieres, 81 where we were later joined by our MT. The Battalion spent several happy
days in this French village and the friendliness and hospitality extended to us by the
villagers knew no limits.!32 About the middle of October we reached our concentration
area, at Henin Lietard, a small industrial village in Northern France 133

was particularly unfortunate with the WMT arriving at the aerodromes 13 days after the rail
parties, 40 which delayed the fly-in of 53 Blenheim (Strategic Reconnaissance) Squadron until
18 September and 4 and 13 Lysander (Tactical Reconnaissance) Squadrons until 2 October, 141
which was not only an embarrassingly poor advertisement for the swift application of air power
but also a reduction of planned capability.
In the Assembly Area, the divisions and corps troops of the BEF were planned to shake-out
in preparation for a move to the Concentration Area near the Franco-Belgian frontier. Political
and military imperatives however, initiated an earlier move, with units and brigades deploying
as they were ready,42 a decision which disrupted the MPP, 43 but did not prevent the troops
from seizing the opportunity to enjoy a little relaxation and extra rations. The 1st Berkshires
recorded: 'Some of the troops visited the local estaminets and learnt, with some surprise, the
potency of the vin blanc... and the cooks began to make delicious omelettes, 44 whilst some
of the officers of 2nd Northamptons were entertained to a champagne reception by Comte de
Courtilbolles and his family.45 From the Assembly Area, units moved the 250 miles to the
Concentration Area centred on Bethune, Lens and Douai to the South-West of Lille. In this
location, 3rd Medium Regiment RA had poor fortune in comparison to 1st Berkshires in the
Assembly Area, being billeted in Souastre, which was described as, 'a dismal place where all the
inhabitants appeared over to be over 80, where there were several funerals a day, and the village
seemed to consist only of manure heaps and battered barns? 46 Unit WMT moved by road,
whilst all tracked vehicles travelled by rail as well as all personnel and the AFG 1098 stores that
could not be moved by unit WMT. In addition, each sub-unit had to ensure that one domestic
vehicl travelled with the rail party.47 The move of 13th Infantry Brigade 48 from the Assembly
Area to the Concentration Area on 29 November 1939149 offers a clear insight into the task.

the flexibility required by units.
