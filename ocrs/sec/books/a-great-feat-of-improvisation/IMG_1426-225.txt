Forces. A succession of evacuated Belgian locomotives and stock steamed through the station
heading to Nantes and Saint Nazaire, whilst a stream of military units, including British, Dutch
and French and units, passed through the village." On 13 June, 1 TSD at Braye dispatched an
urgent consignment of railway material to Saint Malo port for the construction of an improvised
bridge to enable a train ferry to dock? On 14 June 157 RCC was dispatched from Nantes to
Saint Malo port to conduct the work and whilst the unit war diary" does not mention why this
was necessary, one assumption must be that there was a plan to evacuate locomotives, freight
wagons and ambulance trains from France using rail ferries. The withdrawal certainly overtook
whatever was being considered with all British railway equipment in varying states of repair and
operability, being captured by the Germans. Prepared demolition planning and execution was
rare, although, war diaries indicate that some wrecking',? was undertaken in order to prevent
immediate use." Stories of locomotives being run over dock walls into harbours are almost
certainly a myth0° but the shunting locomotive at 1 Heavy Repair Shop (HRS) based at Saint
Etienne de Montluc was steamed into a set of buffers. 101
Amongst other adventures, 190 ROC had an interesting evacuation commencing on 16 June
1940, when a locomotive hauling 75 Ferry Vans, many loaded with ordnance stores and four
containing the messes, cookhouse and fitter's workshop left the Bruz depot for Nantes hauled
by six Great Western Dean Goods 0-6-0 freight locomotives and a LMS 0-6-0 Jinty, which
must have been an amazing sight to behold. The local French signalman would not however,
grant access to the mainline, so the British railway-men dismantled the de-railer, 102 pulled the
ground levers and steamed into Bruz Station, halting for long enough to appropriate a piano on
the platform before departing for their destination.03 Operating on the procedure of Marche a

priest who gave piano recitals during the journey. The unpleasant task of cleaning ash-pans and

A Tragic Finish
On Saturday 15 June 1940, 4 BAD near Rennes, was tasked by ADOS Ammunition at HQ
LOC with out-loading 9,150 tons of ammunition to the UK. 105
By 2200 on 16 June, 2,100
tons had been dispatched in three trains to Saint Malo via the Rennes Base Marshalling Yard
(BMY) but further work was halted because empty rail wagons were unavailable106 although the
industry of the 4 BAD staff was to have unforeseen consequences only 12 hours later. Bizarrely,
the railway at 4 BAD was also busy in-loading ammunition from 6 BAD at Blain, which on
14 June had, after three weeks of deliveries, 2,200 tons on hand,107 all these munitions were
abandoned to the enemy. The order to evacuate to the UK was certainly a surprise to many
calva units and their soldiers, a scenario, which, says as much about the speed of the German
arance, as it does about the British communication of situational awareness. The war diary of
159 RCC, a unit located at 6 BAD,08 summarizes the feeling:
The news of evacuation came as a shock and the order to move at 1830 hrs can only
be alluded to as a bombshell... the general order was to destroy nothing and this was
acted upon though many times since we have all wished that we had disobeyed orders
and burnt the train. 109
