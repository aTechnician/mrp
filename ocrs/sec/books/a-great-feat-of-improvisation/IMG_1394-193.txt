A Great Feat of Improvisation
second was the re-deployment in January 1940, to Dorset and the third was the move from War
Stations to Southampton Docks, for the deployment to France. 26
Between its formation in 1938 and its deployment to France, the Ist Armoured Division
was, for various reasons, unable to conduct meaningful formation training? In particular, the
available logistic components were not to establishment, others were missing from the ORBAT
and there was almost no integration beyond unit tasks and training?8 The failure to mature a
clearly defined armoured doctrine prevented the refinement, through intellectual rigour and
sound planning, of an integrated logistic capability able to support high tempo operations, a
problem compounded by the shortage, rotation and training of logistic units.29 The deficiency
of logistic units within the division is illustrated by the experiences of 10 Company RASC.
Assigned as the Support Group Company, it was for a period in 1939, the Heavy Armoured
Brigade Company before being re-roled and re-organized in November, as a composite
Armoured Divisional Company. 30 The recently retired QMG, Lieutenant-General May, must
have been greatly dismayed by the outcome.
Tank Logistics
The key logistic driver within the armoured division was the tank but because the doctrinal
issues under-pinning divisional operations were not mature, a lacuna in the development of the
supporting logistic concepts quickly appeared. The table below summarizes the complexities:

A common entry in RASC war diaries is: Work and training progressing normally.
The unit war diary also highlights issues relating to personnel stability.
