Indeed, the next challenge was rather less importing fuel to France than transporting it o
the BEF's divisions.
The distribution of POL to the combat formations of the BEF during
the winter of 1939-1940 was initially in accordance with Field Service Regulations" and BER
procedures, which directed that outside of the Base, all POL should be held on wheels, whether
that be military WMT in the direct supply chain or assigned to an En-Cas Mobile (ECM)"
Cased petrol was railed from the MBA or ABA to Corps PRH to be transferred to the loris

collected them for distribution. In the challenging conditions of the January 1940 winter, there
mas interruption to petroleum train schedules to the point where a lieutenant-colonel in Supply
Petrol wrote, referring to the fragile supply of fuel during the deployment of the BEF, I
do not think we could endure the September/October nightmare again' before commenting
pon a proposed ad oc railway solution, When one diverts from routine with railways there is
invariably a hitch', which was probably an unfair comment borne of frustration because overall
SNCF had served the BEF rather well. To mitigate future failure of the 'Just in Time' fuel
supply chain, POL dumps were formed 'in advance of the PRH, either by accumulating stocks
it or near the railhead or through POL being authorized by a corps HQ to be held on the
ground by the DPC or units. This decision enabled the corps to have access to fuel during the
biter February of 1940 when rail disruption was more frequent and provided reserve stocks for
the cops when the GLOC was cut by the German advance in May 1940, albeit it at the cost of
los and quality as stocks deteriorated in storage because there were no qualified personnel to
conduct inspections,80
The introduction of bulk fuel stocks to a fuel supply chain predicated upon a non-returnable
tin inevitably changed the dynamics of the distribution process and to facilitate the operation,
QNG dispatched 100,00 x 4-gallon reusable cans to Rouen, which were followed by another
1,20,00 before the evacuation ended. Can-filling in France had started under a commercial
ontract at Donges on 6 September 1939,82 being expanded under military aegis with a Base
Pato Filling Centre (BPFC) being deployed to Rouen in the ABA and eventually one of its
votions was located forward at Lomme near Lille. This deployment was vital in reducing
tie number of cans required in the loop and the downtime when they were empty and thus
one at Lome filled cans until the town was evacuated on 26 May 1940. The slowly changing
balance from an almost purely 'cased' solution to one with bulk, can and tin solutions is shown
in the bo. howing the holdings across the Theatre at the end January 1940.
