the requirement to emplace a cold chain to move and stock it. Contractors held 2,300 tons in
UK commercial stores representing 40 days consumption for the First Contingent of which,
1,600 tons was shipped as part of the initial deployment.' To move frozen meat in France,
DGT requested 140 insulated ice cooled rail vans be provided, either from production or from
the UK railways, but as a temporary measure GHQ BEF hired 200 vans in the 6-15 ton range

without their blankets and cooking kit for a week and by 20 September there was still no

located in the rail-served Baccarat factory, which was capable of storing 3,000 tons of rations
