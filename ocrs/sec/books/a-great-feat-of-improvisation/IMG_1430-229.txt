A Great Feat of Improvisation
challenges of tank recovery, tactical spacing, the flood of refugees and rubble in the streets,
all reminded the planners of the advantages of rail movement.
Road movement initiated a
continual decline in capability as mechanical failure took its toll, especially affecting the A12
Matilda Il tanks, causing, in conjunction with battle damage, availability to drop from 100
A11 and A12 tanks on 13 May to 7420 on 21 May and after the action at Arras? to 35 on 22
May?.
Such a massive reduction in battle-worthy equipment was a timely reminder of the
failure to ensure the allocation of appropriate logistic support to sustain armoured formations,
especially the provision of spares, recovery assets and Heavy Equipment Transporters. Reserve
ammunition lift for the brigade, split equally between 2nd and 3rd Line components of the
ABC, included 9,600 rounds of 2 pounder AP, 2,052 smoke dischargers, 10,500 HMG 0.50-
inch rounds and 542,000 rounds of 0.303-inch SAA.23 Fuel consumption was a concern, the
road move eating into the 75 mile reserve carried by the ABC petrol section at 2nd and 3rd
Line, an issue complicated by the introduction to the brigade of the A12 Matilda II, which was
powered by a compression ignition engine, thus requiring the distribution of diesel to 7 RTR,
which initially held all these tanks but later also to 4 RTR when the ORBAT was adjusted
by Brigadier Pratt' to meet the tactical dynamics of the operations.
This example exposes
the increasing complexity of logistic support to dispersed armoured formations using a mix of
vehicles, equipment and weapons, but the challenges of effectively executing the tasks was
sometimes obfuscated by HQ Corps, to which the brigade was attached, obviating the brigade
HQ and issuing orders directly to the tank battalions. 26
The role of WMT and particularly the RASC Troop Carrying Companies (TCC) in
generating increased infantry mobility and combat capability was central to the deployment of
the BEF to the River Dyle, the concept being the subject of a detailed analysis by Major Lockhart
RA in an Army Quarterly article of 1937,27 based upon the completion of a divisional move of
42 miles in 16 hours, although whether this focused piece of work influenced the development
