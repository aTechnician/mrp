A Great Feat of Improvisation
sale, over the counter at French chemists, of a drug called 'Dagenan',139 a problem exacerbated
by the refusal of the French authorities to make its sale to British personnel illegal despite a
formal request by the GHQ Medical Branch. 40 Concealment was, of course, not conducive
to effective treatment, and there was an additional out-fall that adversely affected medical care:
soldiers who thought they had VD but were suffering, unknowingly, from another ailment,
were reluctant to report sick, especially when the vision of the departing leave boat loomed. 41
As a measure to prevent soldiers using the medical chain to return to UK, the treatment of the
disease in France was highly effective with only five soldiers having VD being evacuated to the
UK 42 in the period October 1939 to April 1940.143
Equal Opportunity?
A little-known aspect of the expansion of the BEF was the deployment, to Theatre, of members
of the ATS,14 in order to release male soldiers from the Base for service in corps units. The
concept was not unprecedented because women had served in the BEF during the Great War
and from September 1939 Nursing Sisters had deployed 45 to general hospitals, casualty clearing
stations 46 and ambulance trains, their strength reaching 1,191 by May 1940. In December 1939,
Director ATS (DATS) 47 visited headquarters and units in the BEF to assess the possibility of
deploying ATS to theatre. She discussed employment, 48 trades, accommodation 4) and welfare
with the AG Staff, equipment with Director-General Ordnance Services and medical care with
Director-General Medical Services. From this initial work, a plan was formulated to send,
139 Dagenan is a trade-name, the drug being Sulfapyridine, an anti-bacterial Sulfonamide. First produced
by the UK company May & Baker, it was coded as M&B 693 and initially used to treat bacterial
pneumonia, one of the successful patients being Winston Churchill in 1943.

Dagenan has several adverse side-
effects, some of them serious, which could easily be compounded by improper doses, one of which is to
cause a major reduction in the white blood cells, thereby greatly reducing the capacity to fight infection
141 BEF documents shed no light on whether there was a policy for compassionate cases that had been
diagnosed with VD.
