figure, which immediately unbalanced the War Office intention to import 8,000 tons weekly in
order to meet daily requirements and build the planned reserves.
At Brest the reduced imports were the product of a number of factors including poorly stowed
mixed cargoes, unmarked consignments, incomplete documentation, insufficient rail wagons,
labour shortages and unrest, 2l strong Easterly winds and tidal flooding of some of the berths122
and to complete a rather negative report there was a 'severe epidemic of sore throats and colds'
amongst the personnel of 2 Docks Group 23 One irritating issue was the 'long dejeuner taken
by the French locomotive crews operating the dock shunters, but this was overcome when the
operators agreed, in a fine gesture of co-operation and goodwill, to allow the Docks Group
military railwaymen to take over the task whilst they were enjoying lunch. 24 The initial arrival
of the key combat supplies of ammunition and fuel were also delayed. The first two ammunition
ships loading at Newport were late arriving, with the second having to be replaced. 125 This
outcome was exacerbated by the late arrival of the second pair of ammunition ships, although
fortunately the munitions trains with the cargo, were stabled, at some risk, in Newport Docks
and were available in short order.
50 percent of the initial sailings of canned petrol had to be curtailed because of leaking cans,
which had a ripple effect in France in building the planned fuel reserve to schedule. 26 Initially,
the flow of petrol was so slow that effectively the BEF was being refuelled from UK daily with
no reserve to build a working margin on the GLOC. By M+32,27 the BEF was still 4,000 tons
short of its planned allocation, which meant the BEF was consuming each day what was being
imported, a particularly fragile arrangement for an Army commencing a 500 mile drive by road
to its Concentration Area. An often-forgotten element of petrol consumption in the BEF was
the fuel required for cooking 28 which was based upon 1.5 gallons per month per man, 2) so
with the First Contingent deployed, a remarkable 7,890 gallons per day were assigned for this
Supply Directorate officer tasked with a delivering a solution. 130
