Whilst combat units continued to receive fuel in disposable tins, the importance of establishing.
an effective Reverse Logistics"' system to recover the returnable cans and ensure that units
followed the procedures was essential to logistic output and operational capability of the system,
with a change of culture equally important as amendments to process.
This challenge was
explicitly exposed by the French experience of supplying liquid fuel to BEF brigades rotating
through the Maginot Line in the Saar.
Third Army issued fuel to the units of these British
formations in refillable 10 litre cans and 50 litre drums, an increasing number of which, despit
repeated reminders, were not returned, a problem that disrupted the fuel distribution system to
the extent that the French Grand Quartier General issued an edict to the BEF.®
Whilst usable bulk fuel which had been 'packed' to cans only equated to two Days of Supl
