A Great Feat of Improvisation
determine from the documents, but the depot commander's frustrations are lucidly expressed in
the war diary. It was indeed unfortunate, that the visit of the BEF's Quartermaster General,
Lieutenant-General Lindsell on 19 March 1940, was cancelled; there was much he needed to
see?* Apart from that, the OC,95 had made special arrangements for him to have a hot bath,
A summary of the BAD personnel deployment for 29 March 1940, manifestly exposes the
problems inherent in failing to create a meaningful ORBAT for a specialist task; only 18.5
percent of the personnel in the BAD were cap-badged RAOC, although the RAF personnel
were employed as specialists and members of the RASC were also deployed. At the end of
March 1940, there were five soldiers from No 3 LOC and 4th Reserve MT Companies and
another 58 from the 50 Divisional Ammunition Sub-Park RASC, nearly all of whom were
employed to in-load, by road, SW, from the port at Fecamp. There were though, more problems
in the structure and command of the organization, which merit further examination because
on 7 May 1940 key personnel were being employed on fatigues as well as ammunition work.?
No doubt their specializations held no weight with the Sergeant Major's clerk but one detects
within the war diary, pressure upon the OC from all the detachment commanders, to ensure
that every soldier, regardless of his trade, did his fair share of duties.
As they struggled to
complete their tasks, the officers and soldiers of 21 BAD had to operate in the coldest winter
since 1895, the war diary provides ample testimony to the terrible conditions of January 1940
and the fragility of some of the AMPC manpower, an issue which was the subject of a letter
from GHQ to the War Office.?8
At 2100 hours on 21 May, with German armoured forces on the Channel Coast, HQ21 BAD
received information from the Chief of Staff at 2 Base Area" that all SW were to be returned
to the UK or moved to other locations in France. Whilst the planning was being executed for
this task, two officers were involved in a fight, which resulted in one of them being placed in
94 It is also of note that C-in-C BEF never visit 21 BAD, or indeed any other logistic element of the
GLOC, which given the sensitivity of the site and its stocks is certainly an omission on his part.
