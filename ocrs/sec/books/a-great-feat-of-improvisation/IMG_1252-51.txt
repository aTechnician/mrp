One interesting major omission, given its long history, was the 4x4 load carrier. In 1903 Austro-
Daimler built a 4x4 armoured car, whilst in the United States, FWD and Jeffery had produced
nearly 55,000 vehicles during the Great War, with the FWD Corporation continuing the
process with 4x4 and 6x6 in the 1920s and 1930s. Commer, Guy and Morris-Commercial
produced experimental 4x4 Field Artillery Tractors to the specifications issued by the
Mechanization Board, and the Guy and Morris vehicles were approved in late 1938, for Army
service, thereby confirming a position for the 4x4 vehicle in the military environment, although
not in the load-carrying role.®3 In Britain, the 6x484 was preferred to the 4x4 for this task
and although several prototypes were built, by Commer, Garner, Guy and Karrier, there were
no commercial manufacturers producing the 4x4 load-carrying chassis until 1938 when the
Associated Equipment Company (AEC) introduced the Matador, the first heavy 4x4 lorry86
to be made in quantity in the United Kingdom, approximately 8,600 being produced by 1945,
with small additional runs until 1953.87 Purchased as a Medium Artillery Tractor rather than a
load-carrier, the Matador® was based on an AEC commercial 4x4, the 4 ton Hardy, which was
produced in small numbers, mainly for the export market. Also purchased as a FAT but fitted
with a GS body was a small buy of 23 Garner 4x4 G3 lorries. 8º Designed by Nicholas Straussler
and prototyped in 1937-38, it was manufactured by Garner mainly from Ford parts. The War
Office ordered 45 in November 1939 but apparently only purchased 23, although there is no
record of the G3 serving with the BEF?' The Thornycroft Nubian? was too late into service
to serve with the BEF, entering production in June 1940, and the RAF took most of the 4,000
plus output.?3
At a meeting on 23 December 1938, Vauxhall suggested to the War Office that the company
could produce a 4x4 vehicle but it was not until 12 September 1939 that they were requested to
proceed with a prototype, this being completed on 1 February 1940; two more were ready for
es, p.10 and Tank Museum
84 The 3-ton 6x4 provided 11% of the BEF's transport.
85 The first models had ST engines of 7.41 litres
producing 92 bhp but later variants had a 6-cylinder
Cl engine of 95 bhp. The focus on the Matador as an artillery tractor almost certainly delayed its
introduction as a load-carrier. Tank Museum, Data Book of Wheeled Vehicles, Army Transport, pp.76 (86)
86 Gross Vehicle Weight was 10 tons 17-cwt. Ibid, p.77 (87).
87 The Marador remained in British military service until the 1960s, being replaced by the AEC Martian
and Militant Mk lorries, vehicles, which remained in the inventory until the mid 1980s.
88 The abbreviation MAT may have infuenced its renaming from Forward Model 0853 to Matador. The
Matador was famous for its pulling capability, which endeared it to forestry operators, show-grounds,

91 The Garner G3 is not recorded in the Data Book of Wheeled Vehicles. The total build is believed to have
been 53, with 30 being exported to Turkey.

of the design lasted into the early 1970s, mainly for fire tenders. Vanderveen, Historic Military Vehicles
