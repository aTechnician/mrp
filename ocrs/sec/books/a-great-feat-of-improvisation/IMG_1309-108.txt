206 A Great Feat of Improvisation
Assessment and some planning progressed in the 1920s but because no funds were released,
construction approval was not granted.
In June 1935, Master-General of the Ordnance
(MGO)*3 re-commenced the formal debate with a letter to Chief of the Imperial Generall
Staff, 44 the Quartermaster-General, the Permanent Under Secretary and the Under Secretary
of State, 45 which identified two key points: space and vulnerability. On the question of depot
capability, MGO noted that,
'The decision to increase our reserves of ammunition raises the
question of storage accommodation available to hold them. Practically the whole of our present
equipment and reserve ammunition is held at Bramley, but when the reserves have been built
up to the proposed scale ... the accommodation at Bramley will fall short of the requirements
by 116,000 square feet. Capacity, however, was not the only issue because the MGO cogently
articulated: I am not at all happy about storing any war requirements at Bramley ....
view of the danger of air attack it is now generally agreed that above ground storage for filled
ammunition is undesirable '47
The result of these experiences, concerns and committees, was that the War Office planners:
decided that existing surface depots should be used but only for immediate issues, whilst
underground sites with good rail access should be sought for the War Reserve stocks. In late
1935, the War Office, now concerned about not only the vulnerability of Central Ammunition
Depot Bramley but also its inability hold the War Reserve stocks which would be required
to support future operations, committed to an expansion plan based upon dispersion by the
construction of a surface depot at Longtown in Cumberland and burial in underground
facilities in stone quarries around Corsham in Wiltshire, although deployed overseas field
ammunition sites would be reliant on aerial, GBAD, and Passive Air Defence (PAD) measures
such as dispersion, concealment and camouflage. 4) The Army's decision to go underground in

In addition, the design sought to minimize the risk by dispersion and constructing the ESH as sen
sunken bunkers. Indeed, Longtown was the only UK ampersion sit to employ this system, although
the Germans used it extensively, with what became the British Army's 154 Forward Ammunitio
Depot at Wulfen, being an excellent example.
