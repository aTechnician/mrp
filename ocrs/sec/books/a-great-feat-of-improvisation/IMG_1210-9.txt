P1.1 Colonial Experience. Operations across the Empire and in particular the NW
Frontier of India, tested various components of the British Army's logistic capability.
(RLCM: A1/MT/RLCAB/000163)
P1.2 Colonial Logistics. Colonial operations often required specialist or modified
equipment incurring increased expense, whilst sometimes reducing capability for
combat in Europe. An example is a Ford B Van with SDF body fitted with headlamp
sun reflectors, water condenser and additional petrol and water can fitments for duties
in the Sudan. (RLCM: RAOC/WTB1/NNA/0481/1)
P1.3 Colonial Logistic Innovation. A Crossley Light 6 Wheel Low Profile truck for
tactical operations. (RLCM: A1/MT/VR/NOR)
P1.4 Inter-war Logistic Recruiting. The RASC invested in recruiting for the Regular
and Reserve components of the Corps during the 1930s, publishing some wonderful
period material, including this iconic postcard. (RCM: A1/MT/RLCA/20550)
P2.1 Testing & Trialling. 6x4 WMT undergoing trials in UK. (RLCM: Alb/MT/
RLCA/30007)
P2.2 Vehicle storage enhancement. VRD Ashchurch was constructed during 1938-1940
to supplement VRD Feltham. Located in the West of England, 2.5 miles to the
East of Tewkesbury, to reduce the possibility of aerial attack, it was connected to the
LMS Evesham to Tewkesbury railway line and operated by the RASC, although
between 1942-1945 it was a US Army depot. It remains in MOD hands for military
vehicle storage, and rail-served, although the sheds no longer have internal rail
loading platforms. (Steve Cheetham)
P2.3 Empire Experience, 6x4 WMT in India. The 6x4 configuration with twin wheels
was mainly superseded for mass production with 4x2 and later 4x4, using single tyres.
(RLCM: A1b/MT/RLCA/20717)
P2.4 New Capability. Bedford 4x4 QL.. The BEF had few 4x4 WMT variants but
operations in France demonstrated their utility. (RCM: A1b/MT/RICA/20547)
P2.5 WMT Operator Training: Key to logistic capability but challenging to deliver in
the expanding BEF. The numbers of accidents and equipment failures in France
was testament to the difficulties in overcoming the problem. (RICM: A1/MT/
RLCA/20716).
P2.6 New Heavies. Convoy of Foden 6x4 DG6/12 10 ton lorries. (RLCM: A1/MT/
RLCA/20504)
P3.1 Inter war UK divisional logistic capability. An unidentified RASC company at

Eelmoor Plain near Aldershot. Note the respirator haversacks. (RLCM: A1/MT/

P3.2 BEF Divisional WMT. The complex mix of RASC WMT in BEF divisions
complicated logistic planning, load lifts, MT training and Equipment Support.
(RLCM: A1/MT/RLCA/30015)

P4.1 The Far Bank. Carrier & Light Tank Mark VIB of 2nd RTR being off-loaded at
Cherbourg.
Before the introduction of Roll-On Roll-Off MT shipping during the
Second World War, discharge required ships' derricks or dockside cranes, although
the first modern Roll On-Roll Of train ferry service commenced in 1850. (Tank
Museum: 0015/A4)
124
P4.2 Strategic Enabler.
Rail was critical to the deployment of the BEF from the SPODs
to the corps areas on the Franco-Belgian frontier, but pre-war training was essential
in delivering effective capability. A train of tracked armour, WMT and artillery is
loaded at Longmoor Downs in 1933. (WDLMRC: DRMC/V1/171a)
142
P4.3 Strewn with Vehicles. Given the poor reliability of many of the impressed vehicles,
recovery was a key aspect of the deployment on the GLOC routes in September and
October 1939, a capability that was equally important during the advance to contact
in May 1940 and the subsequent withdrawals in May and June. An AEC 850 FWD
R6T recovers a Morris-Commercial 6x4 30 cwt Command Variant on a straight-bar
tow; note the spare fuel cans on the rear of the casualty. The AEC 850 was originally
purchased to tow the 3-inch AA gun and was capable of hauling a light tank on a
trailer with a carrier behind, running on its tracks. (Tank Museum: 6508/A1)

15.1 Sketch Plan of a Bakery. The Corps of Royal Engineers was capable of creating
various types of logistic facilities. (Army Council, Military Engineering, Vol VII,
Accommodation and Installations, 26/Manuals/1062, War Office, London: HMSO:
1934)
149
P5.1 Racking and Stacking. The initial shortage of skilled staff, MHE and racking
caused serious disruption to BOD operations and thus to the distribution of many key
spares. (RLCM: RAOC/Trades 6560/2)
152
P5.2 Stevedore Training. Supplementary RE Reservists of 1 Docks Group RE
conducting 'dry' training in the 'hold' of SS Apple Pie at the Transportation Centre
Longmoor in the summer of 1938. The importance of the Docks Groups to effective
logistic operations was reinforced during the deployment of the BEF but so was
the significance of training and C', all of which required much improvement.
(WDLMRC: DRMC/V1/181c)
158
P5.3 Detail Issue Depot. DID operations were an essential component of the BEF's
logistic matrix during the initial deployment. (RLCM: B3/SRB/NOR)
161
P5.4 Logistic Lesson Learnt. One of the post campaign 'logistic lessons learnt', was the
provision of integrated mobile field bakeries. (RLCM: B3/SRB/RLCAB/000853)
163
P5.5 Cold Storage.
The acquisition of commercial refrigerated facilities was essential
to the BEF's cold chain capability for the distribution of meat and an example of
the significance of the civil economy in supporting military operations in France.
(RLCM: B3/SRB/RLCAB/000823).

P5.6 RASC Bakery Operations. RASC Bakers working an established bakery, although
many of the BEF's facilities were improvised. (RLCM: SRB/RLCAB/000880)
