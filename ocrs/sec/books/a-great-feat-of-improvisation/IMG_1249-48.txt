A Great Feat of Improvisation
services were still establishing facilities, 2 Division CRASC clearly identified in mid-December
1939 that there was an unresolved inherent failure in the planning and delivery of MT spares.
By this date demands for vehicle spares and tool kits were still not being met to the point that
some WMT had been 'Vehicle Off the Road awaiting spares' for three months.*) To illustrate
some of the frustrations from this debacle, OC 1 LOC Railhead Company noted that not only
did 40 percent of the unit vehicles not have a foot-pump for tyre inflation but also that the
equipment was woefully inadequate, it taking a soldier 30 minutes to pump to 20 pounds per
square inch (psi). As most of the unit WMT had 10 - 12 tyres of seven different types operating
between 78-100 psi, the logistics of maintaining the correct pressures became an appreciable
challenge, although as a measure of mitigation seven percent of the vehicles had mechanical
inflators.48 To complete this sorry tale, there was a shortage of tiltst and tarpaulins, issues,
which in the severe winter of 1939-40 generated a deleterious effect upon the condition of the
transported material 50
In January 1938, the requirement was approximately 10,000 vehicles'' for the Field Force
including a new need, recommended by the Carr Committees for 3,693 vehicles in the 3-ton
4x2 category, of which only 1,900 were assessed to be available. Impressment policy was the
responsibility of the QMG whilst the staff of Director Supplies & Transport exercised control of
its implementation. Task delivery was conducted by the RASC through the HQ of Inspectorate
of Supplementary Transport based at Regents Park Barracks in London, who was assisted by
35 inspectors covering four districts across the UK.
This work bore fruit, rapidly generating
large numbers of equipments, although the last-minute decision to accelerate the deployment
of the BEF's First Contingent caused a recasting of the programme, much of which had to be
'hot-planned' with orders issued by telephone. Fortunately plans were in place to purchase spares
for the impressed equipments, except for those additional types introduced at the last minute,
although as the logisticians were to discover, the quantity and scope of the inventory failed to
meet the demand, partly because there was insufficient information relating to reliability of the
impressed vehicles upon which to generate an accurate mean distance between failure for each
type and thus procure the relevant quantities and types of spares. This was a 'Lesson Learned,
the hard way in the Great War, and then apparently forgotten, with Marcosson, in The Busines
of War, attributing much of the BEF's WMT operational success on the Western Front to what
he describes as Vehicle Intelligence and in particular, its excellent inventory control, repair

Mechanical Transport' was a 'notable industrial document', which would be worth its weight in
gold to any motor manufacturer? 53
A greater challenge came from the Ministry of Transport, which revoked the pre-mobilization
agreement with the War Office and requisitioned 7,000 vehicles earmarked for Army use, whilst
other Departments chose to retain some vehicles for essential civil services.54 Nonetheless by
the end of September 1939, the War Office had acquired 26,312 vehicless of which 6,354 were
motor-cycles, 4,285 were cars and 15,305 were load-carrying vehicless with the selection
being made by RASC officers under the direction of the Chief Inspector of Supplementary
Transport (CIST), an organization, which had been maturing under the direction of the QMG
since early 1935. The efficiency and effectiveness of CIST was critical to the mobilization and
deployment of the Army, a factor cogently articulated by the QMG in late 1935, and an output
that he compared to the capability of the Remount system in 1914.58 The Impressment Scheme
was for the most part effective, in spite of the fact that it was designed to acquire a considerably
smaller number of vehicles than occurred but standards had to be sacrificed to meet demand, as
the BEF quickly discovered upon its arrival in France. There were, moreover, issues relating to
its management. The additional officers required for impressments at scale during mobilization
should have been subject to closer pre-war scrutiny because it became clear that a few were
unscrupulous and others incompetent, which led to the acquisition of unsuitable and unreliable
equipments, both of which were detrimental to operational capability. Fortunately most of the
CIST personnel conducted their duties with diligence as the rejection of 40 vehicles out of 86
