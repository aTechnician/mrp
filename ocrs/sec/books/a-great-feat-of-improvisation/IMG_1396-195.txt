A Great Feat of Improvisation
second was the re-deployment in January 1940, to Dorset and the third was the move from War
Stations to Southampton Docks, for the deployment to France. 26
Between its formation in 1938 and its deployment to France, the Ist Armoured Division
was, for various reasons, unable to conduct meaningful formation training." In particular, the
available logistic components were not to establishment, others were missing from the ORBAT
and there was almost no integration beyond unit tasks and training. 28 The failure to mature a
clearly defined armoured doctrine prevented the refinement, through intellectual rigour and
sound planning, of an integrated logistic capability able to support high tempo operations, a
problem compounded by the shortage, rotation and training of logistic units.?" The deficiency
of logistic units within the division is illustrated by the experiences of 10 Company RASC
Assigned as the Support Group Company, it was for a period in 1939, the Heavy Armoured
Brigade Company before being re-roled and re-organized in November, as a composite
Armoured Divisional Company. 0 The recently retired OMG, Lieutenant-General May, must
have been greatly dismayed by the outcome.
Tank Logistics
The key logistic driver within the armoured division was the tank but because the doctrinal
issues under-pinning divisional operations were not mature, a lacuna in the development of the
supporting logistic concepts quickly appeared. The table below summarizes the complexities:

From an analysis of the table, a series of instructive logistic issues arise.
First, is the
ropierent of tel, particularly series 1 indiA 3s, which had a consumption on the road
of approximately one mile per gallon and much less cross-country. With no bull ref ali
apability at Ist or 2nd Line, the delivery of sufficient fuel in the manoeuvre environment would
finitely be a challenge. For example, a full fill for an A13 required 27 x 4-gallon tins, each
of which required manual handling. The positive news from the logistic perspective was that
11 The details in the table have been compiled from the platform Technical Handbooks in the TML and
it became clear that the necessary protection could not be delivered within this limitation and late
