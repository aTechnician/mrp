194 A Great Feat of Improvisation
corps HOs chose to manage by stocking the fuel in 500 ton dumps in the Corps Rear Ares."
Inevitably this created more issues with real estate, concealment, labour and security, resulting
in the Corps Petrol Parks (CPP) focusing as much on the control of dumped stocks, for which
they were not resourced, as the primary task, the delivery of fuel held on wheels.
The fuel planning for the move of 51st (Highland) Division a distance of 250 miles by road
to a concentration area near Metz resulted in an internal spat in GHQ between Q Maintenance
and the Petrol Branch caused by the failure of QIII Corps to consult its DDST.® QIII Cop.

from an AASF dump at Rheims," creating a heated discussion between Maintenance, which
issued a distribution order and Petrol Branch, whose planning staff firmly believed the amou
was excessive. This debate was only resolved when DDST III Corps entered the fray in suppo
of the Petrol Branch.
As the Branch war diary noted, the whole episode "led to a great del
of unnecessary telephoning and taken up hours of valuable time."? Despite these delays ans
frustrations, stocking continued until early May 1940 when the returns recorded" that the BER
had amassed 40,000 tons of MT spirit in tins and 32,000 tons in bulk, plus in cans, 3,000 tons
of diesel and 4,000 tons of greases and lubricating oil,? the latter very much a forgotten but
vital aspect of logistics in an Army that was reliant on mechanically powered equipment for
its operational capability? As the BEF prepared for combat operations, GHQ Petrol Branch
calculated the BEF MT consumption would be 1,200 tons per day, giving a total of 62 DOS,
33 of which, was held as packed fuel. Much of this fuel was held South of the River Somme
and thus became inaccessible to the majority of the combat formations after 20 May 1940 burt

Regulations, a though given the scale of the task, the paucity of information relating to it in the
key manual is certainly surprising?& The Army's responsibility for handling fuel usually ended
at the PRH from which, RAF transport delivered it to Air Stores Parks (ASP), aerodromes"
or dumps. The one contentious issue was supply to the AASF, which was not 'attached' to
the BEF in the sense detailed by Field Service Regulations and thus not subject to War Office
planning processes, 0° although in September 1938, in conjunction with the War Office, the Air
Ministry dispatched a reconnaissance team headed by the Air-Officer-Charge (Designate) for
the AASE, to supplement arrangements which had been previously agreed between the British
and French Air Ministries. This resulted in a decision to stock the assigned aerodromes with
bombs, ammunition, fuel and oil prior to the commencement of mobilization to support the
Quick Despatch Scheme, a task, which sat firmly within the bailiwick of the UK Air Ministry
and not the War Office 01 The scale of the fuel stocking and re-supply task for the AASF
was however, effectively beyond the capability of the RAF and although the RAF remained
rsponsible for calculating the types, quantities and specifications for fuel to support its AASF
air and ground operations, it fell by default to the War Office to store the products in the Base
and deliver them to the nominated railheads in accordance with the Field Service Regulations.
Initially, there was no direct interface between the RAF and GHQ on key logistic
equirements, which presumably influenced the negative movement outcomes, that were a
al mark of the deployment of some of the RAF squadron WMT convoys, a few of which from
50 Wing arrived at the aerodromes 13 days after the rail parties, 02 although the single service
RAF logistic plan to support the AASF Quick Despatch Scheme was equally fragile 103 On 10
Otober 1939, a number of RA F engineer and equipment officers arrived at GH to establish a

their storage in the Base and movement to the railheads 0* This arrangement was reinforced by
