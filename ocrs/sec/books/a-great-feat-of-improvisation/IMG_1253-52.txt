A Great Feat of Improvisation
trials by mid-April 4 The Army tested these two vehicles thoroughly, before placing an orderin
mid-1940, for an initial batch of 4,272, and the legend of the QL series" was born. Production
was delayed until February 1941 because of the need to focus on the main effort, which was the
maintenance of high levels of Bedford OY and MW production, not only replace the losses from
operations in France, but also to meet the demands of the expanding Army. In addition, it ok
30 percent more manpower to build a 4x4 over a 4x2 and skilled labour was at a premium but
once production gained momentum 52,245 QLs were built during the war in addition to the
three prototypes.
The designation QL probably stemmed from the fact that it was a 4x4, and
Quad was a common name for these vehicles, and that it was a full-length lorry, as opposed to
an artillery tractor, hence L, for 'Long'. The following 4x4 load-carriers were being trialled, in
production, or on issue in 1939-1940; the Albion FN 11 4x4 was in the same class as the QL but
only 500 were produced, mainly as mobile workshops."

A particular shortfall in logistic vehicle capability, was the availability of sufficient Heavy
Equipment Transporters (HET) capable of moving tanks and other armoured vehicles in excess
of 10 tons. The BEF only had around 25 HETs" capable of lifting 20-40 tons, nearly all
impressed, and a significant number of 10-ton variants, although few were designed to move
tracked vehicles.100
Vehicle Off the Road
The variation of military types compounded the spares, maintenance and repair issues created
by impressment of commercial marques. Equally challenging was the training and mentoring
of vehicle operators, many of who had no driving licence before they joined the Army and were
now expected to handle an array of equipment, for which there was little and on occasions, no
training, especially in respect of cross-country driving. 101 Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) 02 were
an increasing problem and the subject of a note in Army Training Memorandum 32 in May 1940,
which stated that: 'The majority of these accidents are due to negligence or carelessness and
refect directly on the unit's standard of discipline and training. 103 Apart from the personnel
casualties,°* vehicles were either written off to the detriment of the vehicle reserve or unavailable
for tasking until repaired, which given the shortage of spares and trained workshop personnel
in the BEF not only adversely affected modification and overhaul projects but also transport
capability, a point lucidly highlighted in the note: Military vehicles carry important loads and
their...non-arrival may seriously affect the success of an operation? 10
The operators were not however, the only ones to receive preventative censure from the
chain of command: 'It appears that many officers who have mechanical vehicles on charge are
inclined to regard all driving accidents as errors of judgement on the part of the drivers.......
An avoidable accident is an offence and disciplinary action should be taken if the matter is not
being dealt with by the Civil Power' 106 Whilst this direction may have been deliverable in
combat formations, Base logistic units, many of them ad hoc and recently formed, and under
pressure to perform, had a much greater challenge, often having low-levels of technical training,
dispersed command and control arrangements and sometimes limited experience of the Army's
99 At the outbreak of war, there were only two Scammell 6x4 Pioneer Transporters in service, both of
which had been purchased to move the Vickers Mk II Medium Tank. See, G N Georgano, World War
