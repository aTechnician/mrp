A Great Feat of Improvisation

P10.7 Logistic Lesson Learnt.
Another post campaign 'logistic lesson learnt', was the
provision of integrated mobile laundries. This example was photographed at the
Mobile Laundry Training School Hilsea on 17 August 1940.

P11.1 Fortification Construction. Whilst not on the Gort Line in France but on the
GHQ Stop B Line at Moor Park Farnham Surrey (SU 866463), this FW 3/28
pillbox for a 2 pounder anti-tank gun illustrates the quantity of material and labour
required for construction, often in locations with poor transportation access.

P11.2 Pressed for Space. As vehicle production increased, The increasing flow of military
specification 4x2 WMT equipment from the factories enabled the logisticians to
commence reducing establishment deficiencies from the VRDs in the Spring of 1940,
a process, which continued post campaign to replace the substantial WMT losses in
Covered storage, however, was at a premium and equipment often had to be
stored in the open creating problems with security and reliability. Lorries stored at
VRD Feltham seen in 1941.

P12.1 Railway Construction Training. 152 (GWR) RCC RE, a Supplementary Reserve
unit at Hopkins Bridge LMR in July 1935. Although not Regular units, the RE
railway SR companies were embedded as a core logistic deployment capability in the
BEF and were generally well trained in comparison to other SR units. (WDLMRC:
DRMC/V1/141)
P12.2 Railway Drama. Training did not always mature as planned. A toppled self-
propelled steam excavator at Whitehill on the LMR.
Repair and re-railing skills
learned in the inter-war period were invaluable during operations in France.

P12.3 Rail Wagons. The BEF sought to import wagons from British railway companies
until sufficient stock designed for BEF use in the UK and France could be
manufactured. (Author
P12.4 Railway Movement Training, Morris CDSW 6x4 Field Artillery Tractors towing
25 pounders are loaded at Louisburg Ramp on the LMR in 1938. Note the 'Capes,
Anti-gas providing protection against the rain. Such training was vital to ensuring
strategic mobility in France. (WDLMRC: DRMC/V1/175a)
P13.1 Logistic Challenges. The rapid deployment of Ist Armoured Division to France
created a whole series of logistic fragilities, from which, the formation never
recovered during operations in France. This photograph at Cherbourg Quay on
23 May 1940 is of a Spring peace-time scene, with the threat of aerial attack
seemingly absent but is replete with fascinating logistic detail. In the background,
a sign proclaims Movement Control' by a line of Bedford OYD trucks. In the
foreground, there are two A13 Mk I Cruisers of 2 RTR plus cased petrol and a cone
funnel. Supporting crated stores and equipment, together with the tanks, await rail
transportation, via the ramp to the left, whilst to the right rear, a Matilda Il awaits a

P13.2 Armoured Operations Enabler 1. 1st Armoured Division relied greatly upon rail
movement to create its strategic and operational mobility. On 21 June 1938, Light
and Medium Armour is loaded to 'Rectank' wagons in Woolmer Yard on the LMR
as part of a logistic component of the Army Staff College (ASC) demonstration,
which also included railway operating and construction. Whilst the ASC DS and
students watch the rail action, the gentleman with the hat in civilian clothes in the
left foreground appears to be lubricating' the wagon springs. (WDLMRC: DRMC/

P13.3 Armoured Operations Enabler 2. Scammell Pioneer 20 ton Tank Transporter
'Snow White' with a Cruiser IV negotiates the refugee traffic in the market square
in Le Neubourg on 9 June 1940. The significant shortage of these vehicles critically
restricted the operational manoeuvre capability of 1st Armoured Division. (Tank

P13.4 Logistic Agility.
The provision of military specification 4x2 WMT to logistic units
in 1st Armoured Division reduced demands upon Equipment Support facilities and
spares, whilst enhancing operational capability. Motorcycles, whilst not the safest
form of transport, were vital to control logistic road movement. (RLCM: A1/MT/

decontamination drills to remove liquid GW agents. Although this is a military
event, the soldiers are wearing the civilian pattern respirator, so may be members of

P15.1 Ramping It Up. During the deployment and the campaign, the RCCs were
often tasked with constructing improvised rail loading ramps, which were critical
to effective and efficient rail transportation operations, and thus military capability.

P16.3 Known unto God. An unusual part of the BEF story. This unknown Royal Naval
sailor lies At Rest in Wavre Communal Cemetery and is believed to be a casualty
of Operation ROYAL MARINE which involved the rail movement of floating
mines from Fecamp to place into the River Rhine. Photograph taken in May 2019.
