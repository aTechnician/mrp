complicated by the sustainable speed dissonance between tracked and wheeled vehicles. These
assessments led Lockhart to firmly state that the allocated traffic control resource, the Divisional
Provost Company, was 'totally inadequate' to conduct the operation in war.34
Vulnerable to Enemy Bombing
Most of the BEF's RASC TCCs were committed to supporting the transport of I and II
Corps infantry units to the River Dyle, leaving 5th Infantry Division mostly reliant upon unit
WMT and the marching power of the infantryman's legs, which, whilst part of the soldiers lot
inevitably reduced the speed of deployment and combat power in battle and clearly reinforced
the significance of this vital logistic asset. The move of 143rd Infantry Brigade, tasked to
conduct route protection duties for I Corps, reinforced this point when on 10 May, 9 TCC
was several hours late in reaching unit lines, resulting in the three battalions? not reaching the
operational positions until almost midnight. 36
2 TCC RASC assisted in the deployment of
5th Division from Le Harve to the concentration area at Estaires and 8 Reserve MT Company
RASC37 from Estaires to Hal on the River Senne but some of the infantry battalions, had a
very tiring march in the May heat against an almost overwhelming flood of Belgian refugees.
2nd Northamptons 8 of 17th Infantry Brigade marched 25 miles from Camps-en-A meinnois to
Bernaville on 11 May, then 12 miles to Ligny-sur-Cache on the next day followed by 13 miles
on 15 May arriving at Hernicourt on the afternoon of the 16th and Mekinghem on the morning
of 17 May. 39
On 18 May, 17th Brigade was ordered to withdraw, with the battalions planned to be lifted
by 60 RASC lorries from 5 Division Ammunition Company (DAC)*O and 5 Division Petrol
Company (DPC) Unfortunately, despite an additional 10 * 3 tonners from 9 Reserve MT
Company being attached to 5 DAC'", only 24 vehicles were available, so battalions were ordered
to march. * At approximately 0130 on 19 May, with battalions en-route both on foot and using
unit WMT, the arriving RASC vehicles arrived in the dark from the opposite direction,
causing a trafic jam of monumental proportions, which took over two hours to resolve, the
imperative being to clear it before first-ligh and the potential arrival of the Luftwaffic.* In the
Base however, apart from an increase in the defence alert state and the tempo of out-loading,
military life had more than a peace-time feel to it. On 12 May, 2 Base Supply Depot (BSD)

There can be little doubt that their weary infantry and logistic comrades engaged in combat

prates, a cargo which must have required much manual labour to load, in addition to 320,000
preserved rations,* although with the cut in the GLOC many of these loaded wagons were
tuned to the depot. 48
As part of the logistic lay-down to support Plan D, reserves of ammunition, fuel and supplies

roved to be vulnerable to aerial attack and were drawn down.
Some of the explosives and
munition were out-loaded to 2nd Division to support the defence of the Dyle Line, the
