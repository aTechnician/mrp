A Great Feat of Improvisation
and in anticipation of further short notice orders, in-loaded stocks to Blandford for immediate
dispatch to Poole and Southampton. 10 One of these ECM small coasters, the MV Spinel, was
dispatched to Dunkerque loaded with cased petrol'" but was abandoned in the harbour when
fires in the docks precluded discharge from the vessel."2 Of greater import was the supply
of water, a problem exacerbated when the civil purification plant in Dunkerque was rendered
inoperative by aerial bombing.3 Whilst there was access to canned supplies held in units,
DSCs and a few supply trains scattered around the area held by the BEF and in small quantities
from village sources, it was clear to the logisticians that water might become a defining factor in
the outcome of operations and considerable effort was devoted to delivering this precious liquid
in returnable 4 and 2-gallon petrol tins.l4 80,000 x 4-gallon cans were issued and 40,000 x
2-gallon, of which 24,000 and 37,500 respectively were written off from account through enemy
action or operating loss. 15
The planners estimated that the Force would initially require 2,000 tonnes of stocks per
day and given the availability of the ports, this would have been easily sustainable but as their
capacities rapidly declined through enemy action, support became more difficult and soon
impossible. 116
The imminent fall of Boulogne and Calais prompted, on 24 May, a GHQ
AQMG reconnaissance of two Belgian ports, but operating issues and the aerial and ground
tactical situations prevented development of these options, 117 leaving Dunkerque as the sole port
to sustain the BEF and to evacuate units and personnel no longer essential to the operation.
An ammunition ship arrived on 24 May and the providential arrival of the ARH Detachments
from the corps railheads at coust-sur-Mein and Aubigny provided the technical personnel to
identify the natures in the holds. Unfortunately, the vessel had not been tactically loaded and
the ammunition components needed to be matched before the munitions could be distributed
to Corps Ammunition Parks, a task impossible on the quayside. Inevitably, during the transfer
of the cargo to a less vulnerable location, some items went astray, thus rendering some of the
ammunition unserviceable. 118
Trains continued to be loaded at and dispatched from the port of Dunkerque until 25 May
and although most of them did not reach the intended destinations, un-loading at alternative

were new cans. There appear to be no references in the files consulted,
to contamination of water by petrol from water issued from UK, nor any observations relating to
decontamination of cans for use as water carriers.
