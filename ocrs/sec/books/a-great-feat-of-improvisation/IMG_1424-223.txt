A Great Feat of Improvisation
5 ATN recovered the personnel and equipment of 5 CCS by attaching the 22 wagons in
which it was loaded, to the ambulance train, uncoupling them at Hazebrouck, whilst 7 ATN
entrained 1 CCS and 1 Advanced Medical Stores Depot at Ninove. 6 ATN was trapped at
Albert by bomb damage to the track, the OC"' persuading the three nursing sisters"' to make
their escape to prevent them becoming POWs. They had a harrowing time moving 19 miles
on foot, farm-carts and bicycles to Doullens from where they were evacuated to Cherbourg, 2
the remaining ambulance train staff and all the patients were captured. The Principal Matron
at HQLOC must have been relieved to learn on 28 May 1940 that the QAIMNS staff from
ATN$ 5, 6, 8, 9 & 13 had been evacuated to the UK but very concerned the next day to receive a
signal stating that nothing was known of ATNs 1, 3 and 763 The ATN movement programme
was thoroughly disrupted by the German drive to the Channel coast and access to the six BGH
in 1 MBSA at Dieppe, the six in 2 MBSA around Boulogne and the six in the Main Base Area
in North-West France, was denied. An improvised service was directed to Dunkerque with the
aim of direct evacuation from the rear of the CCSs to the UK. All the nine ambulance trains
remained in France to be captured by the Germans, although some of the stock was recovered
in 1944; fortunately, most of the staff were evacuated. All these exploits were in the highest
traditions of the Army Medical Services and exposed the immense courage and skills of the
military railwaymen. 64

Rail played a significant role in evacuating personnel and material, especially along the GLOC
and there was furious activity in the Base depots to support three different tasks: the evacuation
of material and personnel to the UK, preparations for the arrival of the 2nd BEF and maintaining
British forces South of the River Somme. By the third week of May 1940, 150 RCC was tasked,
assisted by 161 RCC, to urgently construct tank-loading ramps" to support the deployment
of Ist Armoured Division.67
By the first week of June, the 150 RCC main effort was damage
repair, with a particular focus on enabling the recovery of SNCF locomotives and rolling stock.
