resources. Wood dunnage was needed to prevent ammunition boxes being in direct contact
with the ground and tarpaulins were required for weather protection and camouflage; both
these stores were usually in short supply.?
Occasionally Exciting
Life in logistic units varied from the mundane and routine, through to demanding and
occasionally exciting. On 13 January 1940, as a result of intelligence assessments, CAP vehicles
were ordered to be loaded with War Scales of ammunition from local dumps and ARHs,"
all leave was cancelled and units placed on four hours Notice To Move.'* As part of the plan
for I CAP, lorries from 1 & 2 Ammunition Sub-Parks loaded with demolition explosives
were attached to 1 DAC and 2 DAC respectively? Moderate snowfall all day on 16 January,
disrupted the completion of these tasks but much to the relief of the soldiers, the alert was
cancelled the next day.%
It was, to use the terminology of the time, a 'flap', a military drama
that was delightfully described by the war diary scribe of CRE 2nd Division: 'There is no other
single word that implies crises, troop movement, orders, counter orders, packing, unpacking,
packing again, destroying files, looking for letters destroyed…. The word, in fact, implies the
whole gamut of military activity when everybody wants to gets something done but nobody is
quite sure what'?97
The following days were an anti-climax, involving an outbreak of scarlet fever and measles,
CAP personnel assisting RAOC ammunition technicians with work on 40 mm charges,
transport lifts for infantry battalions and the induction of reinforcements from 1 General Base
Depot.?8 Not until 20 March 1940 was the focus returned to operational ammunition tasks,
when a dumping programme commenced, with the Q Staff directing that, 'as far as possible
sites were to be located outside villages'," an instruction that was no doubt a great relief to
the local rural villagers. HQ 4th Division however, was unable to adhere to the directive and
had to initiate a Q examination of the DAC arrangements, which included some munitions
storage around La Madeleine, a small town to the North-East of Lille, although the assessment
concluded that, 'There is no danger to local inhabitants by the storage of this Ammunition
and this has been represented to 2 Corps' 100
Clearly, an internal British Army evaluation cut
relatively little ice with the local French authorities or the population, and there was an on-site
meeting between 4 Division CRASC and the Mayor, resulting in the ammunition remaining
in its original location. 101

The Divisional Supply Columns (DSC) were constantly engaged in ensuring the supported
irmations were supplied with rations, medical consumables, soldier comforts and mail. The
routine activity was unloading the daily section of the 'Pack Train' allocated to the division
and distributing the contents. During the extremes of weather in January and February,
did rains and impassable roads often disrupted the programme, resulting in alternative
mangements having to be planned and briefed. For example, during a 'thaw'
period, 50
nión CRASC directed that units only use light WMT to draw directly from the Divisional
Sipy Railhead (SH) at Famechon, with a request that neighbouring units co-ordinate the
Lifto reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Each drawing unit was allocated a time-slot
the RH, which, ifit was missed, was deferred until the daily programme was complete. 102
Ern when the weather did not disrupt operations, there was usually a myriad of supply issues
i e resolved.
Rations ariving on pack trains were sometimes found not to be to scale. Whether this
