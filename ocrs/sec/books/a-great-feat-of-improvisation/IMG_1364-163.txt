restricted daylight, which reduced the progress of projects. 25 AT Company, whilst waiting
for the additional Nissen huts to be constructed authorized by QII Corps, was able to improve
the drainage for the stables and the camp, although overhead cover for the animals was not
resolved until the spring by which time the weather was improving. 154 On a positive note,
29 AT Company was accommodated in good billets and had a sub-unit Navy Army & Air
Force Institutes (NAAFI) canteen which was recorded as 'doing a good trade, 55 whilst Captain
Ashdown, a Detachment Commander in 32 AT Company was commended for organizing first-
class training? 15 Ongoing issues in February 1940 were the future command arrangements for
Force K7 consisting of two companies of Cypriot Pack animals, the potential utilization of
AT to support aerodrome construction, the outstanding decision on the assignment of 22 AT
Company to III Corps, a request to GHQ BEF for AT to be deployed to support operations in
the Saar and the tireless efforts of the Force Commander to obtain public recognition for the
