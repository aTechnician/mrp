relied upon serial numbers, code addresses and special markings, some of which were out of
date and others unrecognised by Movement Control, which not only led to much irritation
but also to considerable delays in dispatching stores. 124 1 BOD thus struggled to sustain the
outputs, a difficulty aggravated by an inappropriate unit War Establishment. Indeed, given
that the opening stock account was recorded on locally adapted stationery, the soldiers had no
accommodation and catering facilities had to be arranged, it is a wonder that any order was
brought.
Lessons however, were quickly learned, at least at unit level. 2 BOD was initially planne

Equipment Support
As the BEF expanded, whilst also increasing its WMT and AFV fleets, Equipment Support
became ever more important, in the same way that in the past Veterinary and Remount Services
had ben crucial to the operational capability of the Army when its logistics and fighting arms
depended upon animal transport. As the Regular cavalry was mechanized various types of
Cruiser and Light tanks began flowing into the Army's inventory.!37 New guns were also
equipping Royal Artillery regiments, including the 25 pounder field pieces and the 3.7-inch
Heary AA gun and the 40 mm Light AA Bofors. The greatest change however, was the
modernization of the infantry battalion's equipment inventory. Units had 1st Line WMT,
tracked Universal Carriers, towed anti-tank guns and a growing selection of mortars, anti-
tank rifles, Light Machine Guns (LMG), whilst to communicate, new telecommunications
equipment was being introduced.138
The ability to maintain and repair this growing and
increasingly complex inventory required the appropriate equipment such as recovery vehicles
and transporters, a wide range of mechanical, electrical, electronic and optical workshop
fairies, a bewildering array of spares and most importantly, the skilled engineers, artificers
and tradesmen to execute the work.
In 1939, there was no one Corps responsible for Equipment Support because the tasks were
shared across many parts of the Regimental system, although the task of infantry Equipment
Support fell on the RAOC. In the Base and the ABA, the RE deployed workshop capability,
