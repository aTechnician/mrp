receiving 3,000 tons per week by 10 October.
The ABA concept also became a component of the long-term expansion of the GLOC,
designed to potentially sustain up to fifty-five divisions with a strength of approximately 2.25
million men.S0 Another ABA, to support the in-Theatre training of the incoming armoured
divisions, was also planned for Pacy, 35 miles South-South-East of Rouen but the German
attack on 10 May 1940 prevented the progression of this project. As the deployment of the
BEF continued, nearly every major port on the North coast of France was involved in supporting
British Ground and Air Forces in France, including Dieppe for medical evacuation, Le Hane
and Rouen for general stores and Fecamp for ammunition, which comprised some conventional
stocks but the key import was GW munitions in the form of gas shells for artillery and RAR
aerial weapons.2

use, the allocation of commodities to them and the tonnage imports.
