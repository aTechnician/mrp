There were a series of issues during the first six months of the deployment relating to ship
loading in the UK. Many ships had mixed cargoes, a measure designed to spread the loss of
material in a fire or a sinking, whilst others were loaded directly from trains without considering
the discharge requirement, particularly in relation to destination. Consigning materiel to 1 BOD
was inefficient because the time saved in UK by full ship loading was certainly off-set by that
lost in France, a problem compounded by inadequate marking and documentation, which led
to a reduction in the pace of ship unloading and subsequent clearance from the docks. Dock
labour was either civilian provided by the French port authorities, or military controlled through
the AMPC. The latter, whilst under military command, was not generally skilled, consisting
mainly of older cavalry and other military Reservists, although with a leavening of professional
dockers in the original dock labour companies 64 This arrangement was not particularly efficient
and a decision was taken to form permanent stevedore battalions, " of which three were operating
in France by the end of 1939. Another issue was the split responsibility at the SPOD between
the Sea Transport Service of the Ministry of Shipping in charge on-board and the Docks Group
having authority on the quay. QMG BEF took up the cudgel with the Deputy QMG at the
War Office to clarify the arrangements and an agreement was reached with the Ministry of
Shipping that the discharge of ships would be the task of the Military Docks Service subject to
the ships Captain retaining full responsibility for the berthing and safety of the vessel.o? The
French allotted specific priority berths to the UK in each port as shown in the table below,
although they could be used by non-BEF ships when vacant. Depending upon French military
and civil shipping, additional berths could be assigned to the BEF for specific tasks.
