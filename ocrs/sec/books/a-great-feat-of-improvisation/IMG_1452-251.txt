A Great Feat of Improvisation
Ammunition Depot (BAD) and 3 Docks Group were all deemed to be non-essential troops and
ordered to evacuate South across the River Seine by ferries for onward movement by rail to the
Western Ports. 42
Fortunately, this instruction was rescinded, the troops returning to their tasks but their zeal
and industry in evacuating the stocks makes the failure to make the right decision regarding
the destination all the more galling because some of these stocks, 1,500 tons of rations and
other supplies, 300 tons of fodder and 315,000 empty returnable 4 gallon fuel cans, 43 were later
destroyed by enemy air action, although on 8 June, there remained 1,500 tons of rations and
supplies in 3 Base Supply Depot (BSD), 300,000 rations in Detail Issue Depot (DID) Harve, 14
435,000 empty returnable fuel cans at Le Harve and another 300,000 at Rouen. 45 In addition,
left in situ, were 2,500 tons of NAAFI goods, awaiting WMT to the port and 1,000 tons of
frozen meat, which HQ LOC noted was desirable to be moved as soon as possible. On 1 June,
the intention was to transfer the meat to Nantes or 'further South'46 rather than evacuating it to
the UK, for which no refrigerated shipping was available, but movement was prevented by the
dynamic operational scenario, the non-availability of insulated rail wagons and difficulties in
acquiring cold storage in Nantes.47
Stocks from 2 BOD at Le Harve were transferred by rail to 1 BOD at Bruz and Savernay,
whilst all ordnance stores and tentage from hospitals evacuating the Dieppe Medical Base
Sub-Area were to be dispatched to 1 BOD, except for the equipment to build a 2,000 bed Base
General Hospital at La Baule-Escoublac.48 Much of this material reached the Base at Nantes
but overwhelmed the resources of dock labour and the shipping programme and thus remained
in France to be captured by the Germans.4 Indeed, despite the best efforts of the officers and
soldiers of 1 BOD, at least 20,000 tons of ordnance stores were abandoned to the enemy.50
Planning commenced on 28 May to out-load to UK, 900 tons of spares holdings from the
Advanced MT Stores Depot*' at Elbeuf and 80 lorries awaiting repair at the Advanced Heavy
Repair Shop. Unfortunately another 750 tons were out-loaded by ship to Nantes arriving on 12

Base during this period was for logisticians not just a period of intense labour because enemy air

Despatch and Denial
Inthe BSDs, diligent and industrious regimental logisticians, in receipt of sometimes conflicting
r confusing orders from the chain of command, were working to dispatch stocks to units,
nacuate material to the UK or to transfer holdings to the Host Nation. 1 BSD at Redon had
ven focused upon the receipt of supplies from Le Harve, in preparation for transport to the
UK when the CO was ordered to transfer all the supplies to the Town Mayor and evacuate
it personnel through Saint Nazaire, embarking upon the ill-fated Hired Military Transport
HNT) Lancastria? The last task before the unit departed from Redon was to load and dispatch
pack train to Cherbourg with 90,000 rations for 52nd (Lowland) Division. 2 BSD" at Saint
ngonec 30 miles East-North-East of Brest, continued to operate until 16 June, and on that
dispatched 700 tons of supplies by road and rail to Brest for BEF and French units, and
in refugees arriving in the port. The remaining 3,000 tons were transferred in-situ to the
st Nation civil authorities and the personnel departed the site. 8 3 BSD put in an impressive
ormance, out-loading 11,000 tons of rations," initially at a rate of 500 tons per day, mostly
Iri and ship for evacuation, with the balance by road to local units, " although 1,500 tons of
