clothes, blankets and when necessary, web equipment." These outputs did not however, come
without significant industry from the men of 2 MBU because the unit operated seven days a
week from 0700 to 2200º but the 2 MBU appears to have been a motivated organization with
plenty of innovative minds." With bathing in full swing, the OIC was then able to consolidate
the ad hoc commercial arrangements to a centralized facility based upon contracting the facilities
of the Doullens Municipal Baths for a year, thus reducing the annual costs from 234,000 French
Francs to 30,000,2 which must have been mood music to the GHQ Finance Office.
Anti-Gas Logistics
A critical logistic task was the maintenance and distribution of Anti-Gas Equipment (AGE),
which consisted of items of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) for example respirators
and the supporting ancillaries and those forming stocks of Collective Protective Equipment
(CPE) such as bags for contaminated clothing and anti-gas pathways.?3 Specialists within the
RAOC BODs were responsible for repairs to AGE, although some items, such as oilskin suits
for decontamination squads, were often returned to the manufacturer for refurbishment?" The
scalings of reserve AGE were complex, and the tables run to eight parts in Appendix XXII of
Gas Warfare.95
The calculations were probably never fully understood by most soldiers but the
specialist personnel were most industrious in compiling the necessary detail, and acquiring
the equipment, although in October 1939, 4 Division CRASC reported that the unit had not
received authorized scales to be held by 4 DPC for the division and the temporary mobilization
issue received at Colchester required an additional 9 x 3 ton lorries allocated to C Section to
enable the stocks to be held on wheels in accordance with RASC doctrine." Logistic unit war
diaries include descriptions of Anti-Gas Measures (AGM) training but there are relatively few
references to AGE, with, for example, the vehicle loading trial for stocks in 2 DPC not being
conducted until 29 February 1940.'7
Table 10.1 lists examples of the IPE and CPE in the AGE
inventory and issues to the Army in November and December 1939.

One useful idea was to cut the ends off oil barrels, clean them and use them as foot stands so the
soldiers could bathe their feet in hot water whilst they were showering. TNA WO 167/1391: 2 MBU
