were large deficiencies of specific equipment and materiel for the standing formations. The four
regular divisions would be deployed in two corps and there would be two RAF elements,"
for which the Army would have some logistic responsibility?" This new policy had, as one
might expect, a massive impact upon the logistic planning for operations& and the structure of
Treasury defence financing 81 As an illustration of the immense cost this involved, the Army
Defence Programme, 82 which had begun in 1934 with a budget of £39.5 million, was, in June
1939, funded to £700 million.83
The British Air Forces in France (BAFF) comprised two elements: the Air Component of the
BEF, which was under Viscount Gort's operational control, and the Advanced Air Striking Force
(AASF) which was a forward based element of Bomber Command. In January 1940, the command

arrangements, especially in relation to logistics, changed with the
requirement fOBEF to request air support from the AASF through HQ Bomber Command,
and although GHQ had no exclusive right to support, the arrangement created a more effective means

of applying for it. TNA WO 277/34: Air Support in the Battle of France.
There was much confusion on the ground about these responsibilities, especially because the RAF
was to provide support to specified Army units in defined Areas of Responsibility. The AASF was

The deployment to Shanghai in China of a division® of three infantry brigades? in early 1927,
lucidly demonstrated that the British Army was capable of mobilizings and transporting
such a forces across the Globe in support of an international coalition of nations, 88 which
indicated a continuing capability in movements planning, logistic out-load and the acquisition
of shipping." The logistic components were relatively small for a division but this was driven
by the internal geography of the deployment. Of greater longevity, were operations on the
North-West Frontier of India, a location, which not infrequently, reminded those involved of
the fragility of logistics in counter insurgency operations and the need for logisticians to be
combat capable" but also generated innovative procedures such as mobile vehicle maintenance

88 Known as the Shanghai Defence Force or SHAFORCE, it consisted of Dutch, French, Italian,
apanese, Portuguese, Spanish, UK and US units totalling 40,000 personnel. The UK force comprising
20,000 personnel, had a Land element strength of 15,000 personnel and was entitled Duncan Force
after its GOC Major-General and later Sir, John Duncan (1872-1948) CB CMG CVO DSO, late
Royal Scots Fusiliers. Duncan had considerable experience as a GOC, commanding 22nd Division in
Macedonia (1917-1918), 54th (East Anglian) Division in 1923 and immediately before his retirement,
1st Infantry Division in 1928.
89 The logistic requirements for an infantry division of this type engaged on combat operations 20 miles
in advance of a railhead with a LOC 200 miles in length were planned to be comparatively light,
with the daily tonnage totalling 270-300 tons per diem, depending upon the location and mission.
The composition was: Supplies: 100 tons; local supplies, 35 tons; petrol, 33 tons; locomotive coal 33
tons; ammunition, 32 tons; engineer stores, 20 tons; ordnance materiel, 10 tons and mail and EFI, 7
