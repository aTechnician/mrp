534 A Great Feat of Improvisation
that the C-in-C was responsible for the in-Theatre maintenance of the Force in the Field,
the regulations also noted that he and his Staff officers were only responsible for decisions on
technical matters when the Head of a Service referred such issues or if the C-in-C or General
Staff chose to interpose. Unsurprisingly, the General Staff tended to avoid A&Q matters unless
a crisis emerged and even then there was an understandable tendency to remain disengaged for
fear of assuming responsibility for any perceived impending disaster. Whilst Gort had many
tasks pressing upon his time, his interaction with logisticians and logistics appears to be have
been infrequent at best, which may account at least partially for the sudden emergence of the
petrol crisis in October 1939, the shortage of suitable clothing and the long running failure to
grip at the highest level, the Equipment Support issues.
A key lesson from 1914, which itself was under-pinned by pre-Great War military
assessments, was to retain the capability to withdraw along the GLOC. By creating a GLOC,
which ran laterally across a potential German advance, created an in-built fragility, which was
compounded by the Allied failure to maintain an effective strategic mobile reserve to mitigate
the risks. It is certainly ironic that the man who took most of the blame for the failure to
evacuate stocks from the Base, should have identified so incisively the vulnerabilities that the
arrangement posed. The unravelling of the BEF's campaign in France created the one outcome
that the BEF of 1914-1918 had fortuitously avoided, for it always retained access through its
GLOC to the Channel ports, although in 1914 only timely decisions and some deft logistic
foot-work enabled it to do so.
From the BEF's perspective, its practitioners had only just started to get into their stride
when the catastrophic arrival of the Germans on the Channel coast unbalanced the whole of
the BEF's logistic lay-down. Had the Allies retained a powerful strategic reserve to counter-
stroke the German penetration at Sedan, the outcome of the campaign, the Second World War
and the 20th Century history of Europe could have been very different. Whilst the logisticians
may still have been left out of the revised historiography, they would have been critical, as they
were in 1914, to the BEF staying in the fight. It remains therefore, one of those frustrating
historical "ifs' as to the performance and effectiveness of the expanding BEF's logistic systems
and how they would have developed to support the BEF in the field if the scenario had matured
differently. What is not in doubt is that the BEF's logisticians were remarkably quick to learn
and became masters of innovation especially when the chips were down, so the outcome in 1940
does not in any way change the conclusion that logistics of the BEF were indeed a 'Great Feat
of Improvisation'
