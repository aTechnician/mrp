A Great Feat of Improvisation
1937 that approval was given to build one of the three planned units at Bishopton on the South
bank of the River Clyde for the production of propellants, mainly cordite, with a second unit
approved in January 1939.28 Production from ROF Bishopton? did not however, begin until
June 1940, which meant that RGPF Waltham was the sole ROF contributor to propellan
production until the evacuation of the BEF from France. To expand explosives" production,*
ROF Irvine in Ayrshire was refurbished and enhanced at a cost of f2.1 million," whilsta new
factory was built on the Great War munitions site33 at Pembrey, 34 for £2.90 million." In additio
to the immense financial cost, the efforts of the ROFs to supply the BEF with its ammunit
came at some risk to those involved in the manufacturing processes. On 18 January 1940, fire
men were killed at RGPF Waltham in an explosion, which also destroyed four buildings and
disrupted output in others to the detriment of key production" and another on 20 April 1940

deloping storage facilities. The policies that were the foundation for the plans relating to the
ply of ammunition for the BEF were deeply affected by the advent of offensive air power.
ormal concern about the aerial threat to ammunition stocks commenced in 1913 when the
War Office instituted a study to examine it. The planners of the late 1930s were, to a large
etent conditioned not only by the offensive air experiences in the Great War but also by their
reption of its capability in a future conflict.40

it is not practicable on account of expense to make Magazines bomb-proof without

dispersed buildings tend greatly to minimize the danger from aerial attack. They are
further of the opinion that immunity from damage by aerial attack can only be assured
by provisions of underground magazines and ammunition depots. 12
