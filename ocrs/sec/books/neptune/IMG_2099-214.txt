cord of Unloading," in John Lesslie Hall Jr. Papers, box 1, Swem Library, W&M. The
total numbers vary slightly from source to source, but all agree that the number of
American and British or Canadian soldiers was almost exactly even: 314,514 Amer-
icans and 314,547 British and Canadians. The Americans landed more tons of sup-
plies (116,000 to 102,000), while the British landed more vehicles (54,000 to
41,000). These numbers are from Gordon A. Harrison, Cross Channel Attack
(Washington, DC: Office of the Chief of Military History, 1951), 423, who took
them from the SHAEF report of June 20. See also Hartcup, Code Name Mulberry,
122, who offers slightly different totals, but the same general ratios.

(Kirk) to ANCXF (Ramsay), June 22, 1944, ANCXF Papers, Subject File, box 6,

Mulberries... were absolutely essential for the success of Operation Overlord"
(from Morisons introduction to Stanford's Force Mulberry), a view followed by
many historians since. In asserting that, Morison may have sought to validate the
enormous sacrifices the Allies made to sustain the project, for in the end, the artif-
cial harbors added relatively little to the Allied logistical effort.
