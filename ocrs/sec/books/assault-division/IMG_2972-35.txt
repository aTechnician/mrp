The Division, we see, was not alone as it made its uneasy
way south into the grey night.
There was comfort in the sight
and thought of so much aerial and naval support. And the dread-
ful plunge and shudder of the craft was bound to come to an end.
One after another the great buffeting waves were breasted, and,

for most of the Division was between seventeen and twenty hours.

In mid-Channel the waves were between five and six feet
high, and a force 5 wind (16 to 20 knots) was blowing from the
west.
Still there was no resistance from the enemy, and it was
gradually becoming clear that we had achieved the tactical and
strategic surprise that had seemed too much to hope for ; it was
still unbelievable. Shortly after midnight six gliders passed over-

and Orne (Rugger and Cricket). Half an hour later they were

A quiet order from the bridge, a change in the engine tempo,

Another three hours passed before the desultory discharge of
tracer from the enemy coast ahead developed into something
like fireworks, with considerable bomb-flashes. In the darkness
overhead a steady roar was developing.

At last the day broke beneath low clouds. The Naval bom-

alres varying from the 15-inch guns of battleships and monitors
to the 4-inch guns of Hunt class destroyers.
This was no indis-

It was the beginning. The elements
themselves had failed to deflect these relentless forces.
Nary were showing the Division what they could do with odds

waited undaunted to show the Navy what they could do. What
the elements could not achieve it was perhaps unreasonable to

At 5.15 a.m. the enemy made a half-hearted
