67. Simonds singled out General Foulkes and Brigadier Megill (6th Brigade)
for poor tactical planning and for failure to coordinate with the neighboring British
XII Corps to suppress German flanking fire from the high ground west of the Orne.
Hutchinson, "Corps Commander," 180-182.
68. Simonds had concluded by late July that Foulkes was unfit for divisional
command. But, protected by Crerar's patronage and lack of a suitable replacement,
Foulkes not only stayed but went on to command the Canadian I Corps in Italy in
November 1944 and ironically became commander in chief of the Canadian Army
before Simonds. Hutchinson, "Corps Commander," 175-182; Major General

under command. The Canadian 4th Armoured Division arrived in late July. NAC

72. Montgomery wrote of Crerar on 7 July: "I fear very much that Harry
Crerar will be quite unfit to command an Army; I am keeping him out of it as long
as I can ... he is definitely not a commander. He commanded 1 C[anadian] C[orps]
for 2 years, and when it went to Italy the corps HQ proved to be quite untrained."
"When I hand over a sector to Crerar I will certainly teach him his stuff, and I shall
give him tasks within his capabilities. And I shall watch over him carefully." Crerar
disappointed Monty as soon as he took command: Monty wrote "Harry Crerar has
started off his career as an Army com[man]d[er] by thoroughly upsetting everyone;
he had a row with Crocker the first day...
the basic cause was Harry; I fear he
thinks he is a great soldier, and he was determined to show it the very moment he
took over command at 1200 hrs 23 July. He made his first mistake at 1205 hrs; and
his second after lunch." LHCMA AP 14/27, letter, Montgomery to CIGS, 7 July
1944; AP 14/28, letter, Montgomery to CIGS, 14 Julyl 1944. See also Hart,

74. During SPRING Simonds concluded that the "deterioration of its fighting
efficiency was quite out of proportion to actual losses." NAC RG 24 13711, WD GS

80. Ammunition shortages delayed the start of TOTALIZE. Short bombing on
8 August destroyed large quantities of ammunition and forced the rationing of
medium artillery to 25 rounds per gun daily on 10 August, one-third of that avail-
able to British artillery then under command. PRO CAB 44/266, 449-451, 475.

destroyers and assault guns, and twenty-nine antitank guns. Force ratios were
infantry 3:1, armor 7:1, and artillery 10:1.
