97. Accurate figures are unobtainable due to the loss of German records dur-
ing the chaotic retreat. The most widely accepted figures are that the Allies encir-
cled 100,000 German troops, killed 10,000 and captured 40,000, while 50,000
escaped. Panzer Group West estimated the last figure on 21 August based on a dubi-
ous guess by the IlI Flak Corps, which had escaped the pocket prior to the desperate
breakout battle. USAHD MS A-922, Gen. Hans Eberbach, "Panzergroup Eberbach

Actually, the Allies probably surrounded about 80,000 troops, because
most service units and some combat elements either escaped from or were pushed
aside before the pocket closed. In all two army, four corps, and twelve divisional
headquarters were cut off. Allied prisoner estimates are inflated because they are
based on aggregate figures from the entire theater. Of the 42,260 prisoners taken
between 18-23 August, probably 35,000 came from the Falaise pocket. USAHD

106. Heavy rain and low cloud cover prevented any air operations between
21-23 August. Low cloud cover returned on 28 August followed by heavy rain and
poor visibility on 29 August, and intermittent rain on 30 August. The Allies
launched 3,902 sorties at the Seine bridges, ferries, and avenues of German retreat
in late August, with a peak activity of 1,357 sorties on 25 August. Dufresne,

108. The Allies estimated that between 21-29 August the Germans lost 14,000
automobiles and 665 tanks, mostly abandoned due to lack of fuel. This was more
than twice their total losses in the Falaise pocket. A British survey identified 223
German tanks between Falaise and the Seine, only 55 of which Allied action had
destroyed. It attributed 3,770 of 13,350 abandoned vehicles, 15 of 650 tanks, and 10
of 235 self-propelled guns to air attack. On the banks of the Seine estimated losses
due to air attack rose to 33 percent. PRO WO 106/4348, 2 ORS., "Analysis of

109. The Allies estimated that the Germans extricated 98 percent of the troops
and 90 percent of the motor transport that reached the Seine, including 135 armored
fighting vehicles. Dufresne, "Succès allemand," 55.
