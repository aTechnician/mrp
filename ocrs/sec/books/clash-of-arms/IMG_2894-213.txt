This interpretation does not stand up to close scrutiny, for the Germans
had continually reinforced their strength on the St. Lô sector from late June
(see Tables 10.4 and 10.5), and the German defenses south of the city on
the eve of COBRA were only marginally weaker than those south of Caen
(see Table 10.6),60 Despite heavy losses, the German forces were not so
attenuated that they were incapable of halting a U.S. breakout. In fact, the
German Seventh Army had halted all previous attacks, and the heavy U.S.
losses and ammunition expenditures experienced during the capture of St.
Lô in mid-July forced Bradley to launch COBRA short on infantry and with
rationed fire support.

Despite heavy losses, German formations remained stronger than
either Allied intelligence estimates or the German casualty replacement sta-
tistics in Table 10.3 suggest. On the eve of COBRA, Allied intelligence
estimated that German forces in Normandy were 30 percent understrength,
Whereas Army Group B reported a deficiency of 103,000 personnel, about
18 percent. But this German figure both overstated permanent losses and
understated the influx of replacements.61 In reality, about three times more
