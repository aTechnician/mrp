Foreword
D. E. Showalter
Defining operational effectiveness and determining how it is established
are once again among the central questions of military history. Temporarily
eclipsed by a focus on the general social, cultural, and economic factors of
warmaking, the issue of combat performance is increasingly recognized as
the sine qua non of armed forces, even those with a domestic, constabulary
orientation.
That subject is particularly vital in the context of World War II. Since
1945 a virtual cult of the Wehrmacht has emerged among its former ene-
mies. Books, magazines, and films pay tribute to its fighting power. Even
when acknowledging its weaknesses at the levels of strategy and policy,
even when accepting the role of Nazification in its effectiveness, this
school continues to praise in particular the German Army's virtuosity at
operational and tactical levels. At times it seems as though the German
generals allowed the Allies to win the war out of kindness. Allied military
pertormance is generally treated condescendingly. The British and
American armies in particular are dismissed as lacking fighting spirit,
tactical skill, and operational virtuosity, depending on numbers and mate-
rial superiority to win victories by the low common denominator of attri-
tion.
Recent challenges to this paradigm fall into three categories. One
approach, exemplified by Ken Tout's narratives of the fighting in the
Anglo-Canadian sector, stresses the difficulties of conducting offensive
operations, going so far as to argue that the normal result of attacks is either
defeat or a too-costly advance, and that the outcome of battle should be
judged against an expectation of failure. A second perspective, illustrated
by the work of Stephen Ambrose, proffers anecdotal arguments that Allied
soldiers were in fact motivated to fight, and fought well throughout the
northwest Europe campaign. The focus of the third challenge is expressed
in the title of one of its best-known examples. Keith Bonn's When the Odds
Were Even argues that under conditions when their air and artillery superi-
