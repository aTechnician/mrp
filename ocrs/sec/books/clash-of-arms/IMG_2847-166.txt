The 4th Division attacked on a 7-mile front, gaining 3 miles on 7 June, but
failed to capture the St. Marcouf naval battery that disrupted unloading operations
on Utah Beach until 11 June. Though a daring commander, Collins's nickname
derived not from swift combat maneuver but from his earlier command of the 25th
("Tropic Lightning") Division in the Pacific. Joseph L. Collins, Lightning Joe: An
Autobiography (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University, 1979), 205-207;
Harrison, Attack, 341-348, 386-396.
11. The 90th Division could not advance westward during 9-11 June without
help from the 82d Division, suffered heavy losses, abandoned Pont L' Abbé (12
June) and Gourbesville (14 June) when counterattacked, and earned itself the repu-
tation of being a problem division. John Colby, War From the Ground Up: The 90th
Division in World War II (Austin, Tex.: Nortex Press, 1991); A History of the 90th

12. The battered 352d Division defended a 30-mile front with 2,500 combat-
ants. Faulty intelligence that suggested a German counterattack on Carentan on
9-10 June contributed to the Americans' hesitation. USAHD MS B-435, Lt. Col.
Ziegelmann, "352d Division (7 Jun.-10 Jul. 1944)" (Germany: 1947), 1-12;
Harrison, Attack, 336-341.
13. A hasty and piecemeal attack by the U.S. 175th Regiment across the Vire
River brought setback on 12 June as the Germans ambushed and decimated a battal-
ion and captured the regimental commander. Joseph Balkoski, Beyond the
Bridgehead (Harrisburg, Pa.: Stackpole Books, 1989), 179-189, 196-203; Harrison,

15. U.S. units' radio security was very bad and the codes transparent. The call
sign for the V Corps was "V for Victor"! Balkoski, Bridgehead, 189-194; Harrison,
17. Broad-front attacks implemented the U.S. Army concept of the principles
of concentration of effort and economy of force enshrined in FM 100-5. Maximum
U.S. effort along the entire front, however, inflicted intolerable losses on the enemy
and hastened the German collapse in the Cotentin. The German 91st Division, for
example, suffered over 4,000 casualties in the first five days of the invasion and by
mid-June could only muster 2,000 combatants. FM 100-5, Field Service
Regulations (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1941), 11-12; NARA T-311, 26, Lt. Col,

18. U.S. field artillery expenditures increased 50 percent during the second
week. Heavy consumption resulted from efforts to compensate for poor observa-
tion, overcome the defensive advantages of the terrain, and sustain the morale of
attacking infantry. FUSA, Report V, 185-186; GBUSFET Rpt. 58, "Ammunition
Supply for Field Artillery,' 14-15.
19. Between 15-17 June the First Army rationed field artillery to fifty rounds
per gun and medium guns to forty rounds. FUSA, Report V, 185-186; GBUSRET

23. The IX TAC clearly hampered German resupply efforts in the Cotenti
more effectively than the RAF did on the Caen front. The IX TAC's focus on inter-
diction, greater number and superior quality of strike aircraft, and greater availabili-
ty of airfields on the Continent all added to its effectiveness. Moreover, Ce 100-
apply routes in the Cotentin were few and thus more vulnerable to attack. FM 100-

25. The garrison consisted of the battered 709th Division and a regiment of
the 243d Division. By 24 June the former had lost 85 percent of its infantry. NARA
