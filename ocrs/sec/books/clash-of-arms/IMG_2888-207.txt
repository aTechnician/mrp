Germany: The Defeat of the Westheer

tions. Allied aerial interdiction so hampered German movement that the
Allied buildup in Normandy exceeded the German. Thus German forces
became steadily outnumbered and came to lack the logistic base for offen-
sive operations. Allied air superiority hindered German operations to an
unprecedented degree, disrupting supply operations and badly delaying the
arrival of reinforcements and replacements. That the Germans also fought
within range of the Allied fleet ensured that naval gunfire halted every
major German counterattack and inflicted heavy losses.
Nonetheless, German troops fought in Normandy with advantages they
had not often enjoyed. That the Germans defended a short front, in a terrain
that strongly favored defense, allowed Rommel to create defenses in depth,
strongly backed by artillery and armor.? These advantages, coupled with
realistic tactics and quality weapons and training, consistently allowed the
Germans to inflict greater losses on the enemy than they themselves suf-
fered, despite growing numerical and material inferiority (see Table 10.1).

Despite these advantages, and the greater firepower German forma-
tions deployed, the Westheer proved unable, given the constraints it operat-
ed under, to conduct major offensive action. Above all else, the diminution
of German striking power reflected the greatly improved defensive abilities
of its opponents: the blitzkrieg tactics that had triumphed over neglected
and unprepared militaries during 1939-1941 no longer prevailed. Indeed, in
Normandy, Allied firepower combined with sea and air power halted every
major German attack and inexorably sapped German strength.
Nevertheless, the Westheer still fought remarkably well, considering its
losses, and its overall professionalism meant that it rarely made serious tac-
tical blunders despite the inevitable decline in standards after five years of
war. In Normandy, the individual German soldier remained more resource-
ful and resilient than his Allied counterpart. Severe discipline, nazi ideolo-
8y, effective propaganda, realistic training that stressed individual initia-
tive, extensive combat experience, and broad protessionalism commued to
