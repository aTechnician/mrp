59. That Eisenhower believed Montgomery was about to launch a major
breakout bid indicates that he completely misunderstood "Monty's" theater strategy.
Alan Brooke wrote of Eisenhower on 27 July that "Ike knows nothing about strate-
gy and is quite unsuited to the post of Supreme Commander," a conclusion rein-
forced by Eisenhower's preference for Alexander as land forces commander and his
demand for a "fulldress attack on the left flank." Alanbrooke Diary, 27 July 1944,

fact they were 10 miles deep. PRO WO 232/21, DTI, "Operational Research

61. Inadequate mine clearance, which Dempsey kept to a minimum prior to 18
Jully in an abortive effort to maintain surprise, added to the delay and the conges-
tion. PRO WO 232/21, Op. Research Rpt. "Op. GOODWOOD."
British inability to deploy forward artillery to maintain continuous indi-
rect-fire support was a particular weakness. The guns remained stuck in the traffic
jam debouching from the Orne bridgehead, and thus the armored spearhead was out
of field artillery range.
63. Accounts of GOODWOOD exaggerate the tank-busting success of the III
flak Corps. In fact, it was army 88mm heavy antitank guns that did most of the
damage. Janusz Piekelwicz, Die 88mm Flak in Erdkampf-Einsatz (Stuttgart:

72. Diversionary attacks by the XII and XXX Corps (GREENLINE on Evrecy

73. Historians have accepted grossly inflated regimental claims of heavy dam-
age inflicted (109 enemy tanks alone on 18 July). Yet the Second Army only offi-
cially claimed 20 tank kills during GOODWOOD, and the I SS Panzer Corps actu-
ally lost 27 tanks. NARA T-311, 420, KTB PzGr. West, 18-21 July 1944; PRO WO
