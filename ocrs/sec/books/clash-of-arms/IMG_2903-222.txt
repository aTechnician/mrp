shortage. Of its 18,748 tons of stockpiled ammunition on 1 June, only 7,172 tons
(38 percent) was stored in Normandy. NARA T-312, 1571, 000607, 7 AOK,

71. During the spring of 1944, its gasoline stocks dropped from 7.450 to 4.663
million liters. To redeploy its reserves required twenty times its available lift capac-
ity. NARA T-312, 1571, 000607, "Versorgungslage AOK 7 Stand: 1.1.1944"; T-311,

72. Incomplete figures for June indicate that the Germans lost 654,000 liters
of gasoline, 2,308 tons of ammunition, and 2,225 tons of trucking capacity on
resupply operations. Total losses from air and sabotage attacks in the West up to 28
June amounted to 10,042 tons of ammunition, 4,374,000 liters of fuel, and 3,383
tons of transport capacity. Fuel losses (from all causes) in June totaled 7,374,000
liters. Only 37 percent of the munitions dispatched to the Seventh Army had arrived
by 28 June. NARA T-311, 14, 7014553 OQu West BdE, 30 June 1944; T-312, 1571,

73. Up to 15 June the Westheer expended 5,000 tons of munitions but received
only 3,000 tons. Against a daily requirement of 4,500 tons of supplies for offensive
action, the Seventh Army had only 1,300 tons of transport capacity. NARA T-311,

76. On 19 June, rail travel resumed from Paris to Dreux and Verneuil and
across the Loire at Tours as far as Le Mans. The Tours rail bridge remained too
badly damaged to allow unrestricted single-track crossing before 29 June, and even
then many trains continued to unload south of the Loire. NARA T-78, 611, 000088,

78. The Germans also ferried supplies from the Atlantic ports of Bordeaux and
Royan to the Breton ports of Brest, St. Nazaire, Lorient, and St. Malo. But lack of
shipping, Allied air attacks, the distances involved, and lack of supplies ensured that
this operation contributed little to the German resupply effort. The first Paris barges

unloaded at Elbeuf on 22 June and between 1-10 July delivered an average of 433
tons daily. NARA T-78, 611, 000092, General des Transportwesens West,

79. Up to 15 June one-fifth of the German transport reserve was disabled by
air attacks, breakdowns, and accidents. In June Army Group B lost 1,866 trucks, 33
buses, 103 prime movers, and 2,198 other motor vehicles, including on average 30
supply trucks daily. NARA T-311, 1, 7000828, Ob. Kdo. d. Heeresgr.

interior merely exacerbated truck losses and accelerated the decline in unit mobility.

81. Between 9 June and 7 July 10,440 tons of supplies passed through Tours,
an average of 360 tons a day. The importance of the supply line through Tours can
be gauged by the immediate and frantic German effort to rebuild the bridge by
erecting a temporary span. NARA T-311, 1, 7009804, TKB HG. B Abt. Qu. Ib BrB.

84. Historians have missed the impact of GOODWOOD on the German logis-
tic situation in assessing its contribution to Allied victory in Normandy. It was in
this realm that GOODWOOD made a decisive contribution to COBRA's success.
The Seventh Army only maintained its gasoline receipts at 73 percent of pre-
GOODWOOD levels by employing most of its own trucks to collect fuel from Le
Alençon, and Dreux.

Between late June and 24 July, Kampfgruppe Kentner's ammunition
stocks for machine guns and mortars declined by 64 percent and 75 percent, respec-
tively. On the eve of COBRA, Kampfgruppe Kuske of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier
Division Götz von Berlichingen had only 1,000 rounds per machine gun and thirty
rounds per rifle; less than two days' combat at average consumption rates. NARA,
