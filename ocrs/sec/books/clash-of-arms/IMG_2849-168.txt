Normandy 1944
62. Seven pooled battalions each fought continuously in northwest Europe
with the same division: the 745th and 746th Tank Battalions (1st and 9th Divisions);
the 612th, 630th, and 644th Tank Destroyer Battalions (2d, 1st, 8th Divisions); and
the 376th and 445th Antiaircraft Auto-Weapons Battalions (9th and 8th Divisions).

The St. Marcouf repulse (7-9 June), the Aure Valley ambush, and the
Seves "island" debacle (23 July) were all partly due to haste.
69. By early July, senior U.S. Army commanders had come to believe that the
British were not pulling their weight. Eisenhower on 7 July criticized Montgomery
because he had not attempted "a major full dress attack on the left flank supported
by everything we could bring to bear." Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives
(LHCMA), King's College, London, Alanbrooke Papers AP14/27, fol. 7.

a cost of 2,800 casualties and "heavy" tank losses. FUSA, Report V, 198;

80. Improved coordination was apparent in the 2d, 29th, 30th, 83d, and 90th
Divisions. Faulkner, "Learning the Hard Way," 24-29.
81. The capture of St. Lô had cost the First Army 40,000 casualties. And the
U.S. forces had not quite reached the more open terrain (the line Caumont-St.
Lô Coutances) required for a breakthrough attempt. Prior to COBRA, the U.S.
First Army launched several hasty limited attacks to obtain a better start line. The
decimation of a battalion of the 90th Division during the Sèves "island" disaster of
22-23 July illustrated the danger of excessive haste when combined with inade-
quate resources.
82. The fire at Depot 101 destroyed 1,500 tons of munitions and led to a major
shortage of 81mm mortar rounds that forced tight rationing on 15 July. On 25 July
The United States: The Leviathan Triumphant
the First Army rationed fire support for COBRA to a mere three to fifteen rounds
per gun. Field artillery expenditures between 23-29 July averaged twenty rounds
per gun, one-quarter of previous rates. FUSA, Report V, 185-186; VI, 71; Lida

83. By 31 July, U.S. casualties had passed 100,000 and the 29th Division
alone had suffered 9,939 casualties. Many rifle companies were down to less than
half their strength. The ETO U.S. Army had furnished infantry replacements calcu-
lating that they would make up 70.3 percent of casualties, whereas, in actuality, up
to 31 July they amounted to 85 percent. As a result, the First Army had to make an
emergency request for 25,000 additional infantry replacements.
84. Up to 31 July, casualties among rifle companies in three infantry divisions
were 79.5 percent for officers and 73.5 percent for other ranks. In the 29th Division
three days in the line earned a rifleman the title of an "old" soldier. Stouffer, Studies
II, 8ff; Balkoski, Bridgehead, 220.
85. On 17 July, for example, the 3d Battalion, 115th Infantry Regiment was
down to 20 percent of its strength. Balkoski, Bridgehead, 262.
86. Only the elite U.S. airborne forces lacked replacements. FUSA, Report IV,
87. New replacements were more likely to become casualties, and as a result
units with many raw replacements suffered disproportionate losses. Despite the
drawbacks of the replacement system, U.S. infantry remained cohesive throughout
the campaign. Up to 24 July military police had apprehended only 228 stragglers.
FUSA, Report V, 81; Blumenson, Breakout, 198-204.
88. A replacement system on German lines would have prevented the continu-
ous flow of replacements to the front and forced the army to raise many more than
the ninety divisions it did in order to rotate divisions out of line for rest and rehabil-
tation. Balkoski, Bridgehead, 227-228.
89. Between 27 June and 25 July, the number of German infantry battalions
assigned to LXXXIV Corps more than doubled and armored strength nearly tripled.
The conventional view that sustained attrition had crippled German resistance sim-
Ply does not fit the evidence. The loss of St. Lô, however, did ensure that the
German defenses were thinner and the troops were concentrated more forward han
doctrine advocated. NARA T-314, 1604, "Meldung LXXXIV A.K. v. 27.6.1944."

throughout the campaign. The Ist Division, for example, was short only 260.

92. Up to 1 August the U.S. First Army discharged, transferred, or reassigned
126 officers, including 8 colonels, 5 lieutenant colonels, and 4 majors. Including
battle casualties, the First Army replaced no fewer than 27 colonels and 52 lieu-
tenant colonels during the cals anign. FUSA, Report V, 69-70.
