Normandy 1944
seize Vire was a serious blunder that aided the enemy's retreat from
Mortain. Taking Vire would have severed the enemy's lateral communica-
tions lines and seriously compromised the German retreat. 81
Uneven performance on a unit-to-unit basis also undermined success.
While the VIII Corps advanced steadily, the 7th and Guards Armoured
Divisions of the XXX Corps soon lagged. This left the 11th Armoured
Division's flanks and spearhead dangerously exposed as resistance stiff-
ened on 1 August with the arrival of German armor from Caen. On 6
August, German counterblows came against the apex of the 11th Armoured
salient that were barely beaten off. It was fortunate that the German armor
was anxious to push westward against the Americans, and so only limited
counterattacks were launched.
The XXX Corps performed so poorly during BLUECOAT that
Dempsey sacked its commander, Gen. Bucknall, and replaced him with
Brian Horrocks 82 Overwhelming evidence that the 7th Armoured Division
was "sticky" led to a major purge of officers among the "Desert Rats."83 At
the same time, the sluggishness of the Guards Armoured Division demon-
strated that it had not fully recovered from GOODWOOD.84
But BLUECOAT was notable because it saw both improved coordina-
tion as well as tactical adaptation among a number of British formations.
General O'Connor had recognized during earlier operations both how poor-
ly British forces coordinated and the need for teamwork for success in the
bocage. In the few days available prior to BLUECOAT, he reorganized the
litt
11th Armoured Division into two balanced combined-arms brigade groups.
Immediate tactical success rewarded those British formations that exhibited
improved coordination during BLUECOAT. The 6th Guards Tank Brigade,
in particular, coordinated closely with the 15th Scottish Division, which led
to the quick capture of Hill 309. These two formations also innovated tacti-
cally and employed embryonic converging flanking attacks in the clearance
of Lutain Wood, tactics that they would refine and use with increasing
effectiveness thereafter. 85
The front became fluid in the second week of August as the Germans
fell back in response to the U.S. breakout. But tired, demoralized, and
depleted British forces failed to pursue the enemy aggressively and were
largely content to follow up after German withdrawals.86 The major prob-
lem that Montgomery faced during August was that British forces experi-
enced what Clausewitz termed "relaxation of effort" as the troops sensed
that victory was at hand. Thus in mid-August British pressure slackened
across the entire front. 87 Montgomery, therefore, did not launch Operation
KITTEN, the long-planned advance to the Seine, until 16 August.
By August a mounting infantry shortage was affecting British perform-
ance (see Table 8.3),88 Since the War Office had pared Home Forces to the
bone during the spring and troops remustered as infantry were still training,
during August 1944 Montgomery had to disband the 59th Division

and reduce the 50th Division to cadre strength. 89 The manpower shortage
clearly ate away at British drive and vigor during August, but the regimen-
tal system hampered War Office efforts to transfer personnel and alleviate
shortages. It was fortunate for Montgomery that losses declined as his
forces raced across France in the late summer.º0
Waning British drive contributed to the Allied failure to destroy the
Germans in the Falaise pocket in mid-August-that had been a unique
opportunity for the Allies to deal a knockout blow to the Westheer.9l Some
of the blame for failure lay at Montgomery's door. War weariness, com-
bined with the methodical pace of operations, ensured that Anglo-Canadian
forces did not pressure the enemy strongly as the U.S. advance swept north-
east and began to push the Germans into a pocket between Argentan and
Falaise. This lack of pressure allowed the enemy to conduct an orderly
withdrawal from the still open pocket until 19 August, when the Canadians
finally closed it-but tens of thousands of German troops escaped in the
interim.
Montgomery feared that his tired and depleted forces would suffer
neavy losses and a possible setback if he tried to stop the desperate but
determined enemy from escaping. Instead he, like Eisenhower, looked
toward a larger envelopment along the Seine River. At the same time,
Montgomery's continued underestimation of American speed and mobility
hampered Bradley's efforts to close the pocket from the south.
