Normandy 1944
Normandy. Simonds rapidly put together a plan for a new offensive to seize
Falaise, called TRACTABLE, which he launched on 14 August.
Simonds employed a revised version of the TOTALIZE plan that this
time took place in daylight, using smokescreens to give the cover that dark-
ness had afforded TOTALIZE. Simonds employed two Canadian divisions,
the 4th Armoured and 3d Infantry, on a narrow frontage. To maintain sur-
prise, Simonds again avoided a long preliminary barrage that would warn
the Germans of an impending attack. Moreover, a combined-arms brigade
group built around armor led each divisional advance as Simonds reverted
to the discredited pre-1943 British attack doctrine in which massed armor
spearheaded the break-in battle.55 Despite the final fall of Falaise on 16
August, the Germans offered desperate resistance as they sought to hold
open a narrow corridor to allow their retreating forces to escape encir-
clement. Thus TRACTABLE failed in its objective to complete the encir-
clement of the enemy in the Falaise pocket.
As the German forces retired eastward it became imperative for the
Canadian First Army to renew its attempt to close the pocket. Lacking the
ume to organize a new offensive, Crerar ordered his divisions to continue
the attack southeast until they met the U.S. forces advancing northeast
beyond Argentan. On 17 August, the tired Polish Ist and Canadian 4th
Armoured Divisions aided by the Canadian 3d Infantry Division again
struck southeast and fought their way forward until they linked up with
U.S. troops at Chambois on 19 August to finally seal the Falaise pocket.36
But Crera's troops could not seal the pocket tightly, and over the next three
days, tens of thousands of German troops fought their way out of the pock-
et during some of the most ferocious combat of the campaign.
During late August, the Germans achieved their most significant defen-
sive success of the campaign as they extricated virtually all their surviving
personnel and a surprising amount of equipment from behind the Seine
amid a general strategic withdrawal. 57 After the breakout from Falaise, the
specter of a much larger encirclement on the Seine threatened the annihila-
tion of all the German forces west of the river. The dwindling mobility, car-
astrophic supply situation, and increasing demoralization of German forces,
presented the athes with a genuine strategic opportunity to annihilate the
enemy against the Seine. But in late August, the Germans pulled off their
greatest success of the campaign as they extricated from west of the Seine
virtually all their remaining forces in Normandy in a remarkable feat of
organization and improvisation. The retreat beyond the Seine, completed
by the end of August, not only effectively ended the Normandy campaign
out also had important consequences. The preservation of the core of the
verman forces deployed in Normandy allowed Hitler to flesh out a new
westeer in the lad with which he would launch the December 1944
Ardennes counteroffensive. In fact, without success on the Seine in late
August, Hitler could not have attacked in the West in 1944 at all.

Notes
the
1. Both Ultra intercepts and theater intelligence provided ample warning of
advance
of
Kampfgruppe
Meyer,
the
reinforced
25th
SS
Panzergrenadier Regiment, into the Caen area during the night of 6-7 June. The
Canadian dash was probably the result of Montgomery's exhortation to drive boldly
inland to seize a sizeable bridgehead.

the enemy could disrupt German supplies and speed German defeat at lower cost.
