classified as combatants, compared to 65 percent in the British army. The U.S.
—which shared the same geostrategic problems of projecting military power
from North America to Europe via an advanced base in Britain-achieved a much
higher ratio of combat to service personnel in the ETO. In late 1944 only 40 percent
of the CAO's manpower was in combat formations in contrast to 52 percent for the
U.S. Army. Average divisional slices for the U.S., British, and Canadian armies in
November 1944 were 71,100, 84,300, and 93,150, respectively. Burns, Manpower,

Germany, 1939-1944:
Blitzkrieg Unleashed
Early in World War II, Germany had won a series of military victories that
shattered the European balance of power. Central to German success was
the Heer's willingness to evaluate its own performance critically and hon-
estly, to absorb combat lessons, and to retrain, reorganize, and reequip to
enhance its combat effectiveness. This determination helped Germany
acquire a hegemony in Europe despite a weak strategic base and the
absence of an economy organized for war.
On 1 September 1939, Germany unleashed fifty-five of its best divi-
sions and most of its armor and aircraft against Poland's forty-division
army. While lack of prepared defenses, modern equipment, and communi-
cations hampered the Polish defense, Poland's decision to defend its
extended western frontier left its army vulnerable to strategic encirclement
and annihilation as the Germans executed a double envelopment to destroy
the main body of the Polish Army in the bend of the Vistula River. The
Poles fought valiantly, but their strategic position was untenable against
superior German strength, and resistance ceased after thirty-six days. This
campaign saw the first application of blitzkrieg warfare, which combined
traditional Prussian Kesselschlacht encirclement strategy with revolution-
ary new mechanized forces.! The Germans remained uncertain about the
potential of armored forces, and they dispersed much of their armor.
Nevertheless armor played a major role in the German victory. Mechanized
forces occasionally supported by punishing tactical air strikes penetrat-
ed deep into the enemy forces' rear to disrupt communications and paralyze
the Polish units until German infantry and artillery could arrive to annihi-
late them. This combination allowed the Germans to overrun rapidly
Poland at light cost.
Central to the remarkable early German triumphs was the German mil-
itary's professional commitment to critical self-appraisal and a refusal to
equate victory with excellence in performance. This determination allowed
the Heer progressively to enhance its combat capabilities. During winter of
