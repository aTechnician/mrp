the German military between the wars see Citino, Blitzkrieg Tactics. This study,
however, neglects the historic roots of blitzkrieg in the Prussian military tradition.
122. Versailles allowed Germany 16,407 cavalry in three small divisions. By
1933 the Reichswehr had transformed this force, which the Allies had conceived as
useful only for crowd control, into a semimotorized mobile corps. Edgar Graf v.

Militärgeschichte VI, 322-324; Klaus C. Richter, Die Feldgrauen Reiter: Die berit-

127. Germany opened an armored school at Kazan in the Soviet Union in
1926 and trained on Soviet-purchased British Vickers medium tanks and covertly

131. These formations- the 4th and 6th Panzer Brigades, the 1st-4th Light
and the 2d, 13th, 20th, and 29th Motorized Infantry Divisions-were concentrated
in the XIV-XVI Corps. Tessin, Formationsgeschichte, 58-59.

The Interwar Period

135. In 1938 Germany possessed only 1 percent of global gold and financial
reserves. The occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 increased Germany's
financial reserves nearly tenfold. Murray, Balance of Power, 12-17.
136. Coal was the only raw material that Germany possessed in abundance,
but such deposits were located vulnerably close to Germany's frontiers.
The German economy was weakest in the petroleum and metals sectors and was
especially reliant on Swedish iron ore imports. Murray, Balance of Power,
137. German defense spending during 1935-1938 was 13 percent of aggregate
national expenditure. In France the figure was 7.0 percent and in Britain 5.5 per-
cent. Macgregor Knox, Mussolini Unleashed (London: 1982), 294-296.
138. On 2 March 1939 field units were short of the following: rifles 18.5 per-
cent, machine guns 29.0 percent, antitank guns 25.0 percent, light mortars 58.0 per-
cent, medium mortars 53.5 percent, infantry guns 24.0 percent, light field howitzers
20.0 percent, and heavy field howitzers 50.0 percent. Schottelius and Caspar,
"Organisation des Heeres," 397; Manfred Messerschmidt, "German Military
Effectiveness during the Interwar Period," in Murray and Millett, eds., Military
Effectiveness II, 227.
139. In June 1938 Germany possessed only four months of petroleum
140. In 1939 Germany had prototypes of the "Freya" aircraft early-warning,
the "Wurzburg" antiaircraft artillery fire-control, and naval tactical (Seetakt) radars.

141. In March 1936 after expansion to twenty-four divisions, the Reichswehr
only rated four brigades and six air squadrons as combat ready. Whaley, Covert
Rearmament, 58-59.
142. In September 1939 less than 5 percent of combat battalions were nondivi-
sional army troops. Tessin, Formationsgeschichte, passim.

146. Halving training time for officer cadets, increasing intake of candidates
tenfold, absorbing police officers, commissioning NCOs, and recommissioning
Imperial Army officers failed to fill junior officer vacancies. Thus the officer-enlis-
tee ratio of 1:24 in 1933 had widened to 1:26 by September 1939 and reached 1:40
in June 1944. Corum, Roots of Blitzkrieg, 76; Wolf Keilig, Das Deutsche Heer (Bad
Nauheim: Podzun, 1956) 203, 1-24.
147. Some 19,000 German troops, 180 tanks, and 250 planes fought with the
