4. The Canadians suffered 1,094 casualties on D-Day, 8 percent of those
landed. On the assault see C. P. Stacey, The Victory Campaign (Ottawa: Queen's
Printer, 1960), chap. 5; Reginald Roy, 1944: The Canadians in Normandy (Toronto:

Failure in High Command (Toronto: Praeger, 1991), chap. 9.
5. The division had expected to be quickly withdrawn after it had established
a bridgehead. This misconception reflected the fundamental flaw in the OVER-
LORD plan—its failure to address how exactly the Allies would translate a success-
ful lodgement into a subsequent breakout. PRO WO 205/ 118, TAG G(Plans),

D. Both Ultra intercepts and theater intelligence provided ample warning of
the advance of Kampfgruppe Meyer, the reinforced 25th SS Panzergrenadier
Regiment, into the Caen area during the night of 6-7 June. The Canadian dash was
probably the result of Montgomery's exhortation to drive boldly inland to seize a
sizeable bridgehead even at the cost of heavy losses.
7. The force consisted of a 27th Armoured Regiment recon. troop (MS
Stuarts), a carrier-mounted North Nova Scotia Highlander company, a medium
machine gun platoon, an M10 tank destroyer troop, two engineer assault sections,
four towed 6-pounder antitank guns, and three North Nova Scotia Highlander com-
panies riding on the Shermans of the Sherbrooke Fusiliers. NAC RG 24 13766, WD

8. The German force comprised 3 Panzergrenadier and 2 tank companies.

destroyed; the Germans 88 casualties and 9 tanks disabled. NC RG 24 13766, WD

15. The division produced a report on 21 June evaluating its D-Day landing. A
major obstacle to retraining was the Anglo-Canadian habit of keeping units forward
in the line. NAC RG 24 13766, Maj. Gen. R. F. L. Keller, "Comments on Op.
OVERLORD," 21 June 1944, WD GS 3 CID, June 1944.
16. Scheduled to become operational on 20 June, Crerar's headquarters did
not do so until 23 July. Montgomery also speeded up the arrival of the 2d Division
(it began arriving on 7 July) and phased back the 4th Armoured Division both to
gain more infantry and to concentrate two Canadian divisions under what ne con-
sidered the more competent command of General Simonds's Canadian Il Corps,
which moved to France in late June. NAC RG 24 13710, WD GS II Cdn. Corps

heavy flak guns. NAC RG 24 13766, 3 CID Int. Sum. 17, 4 July 1944; Meyer,

19. The Canadians employed in the attack four infantry battalions, three
machine gun companies, an armored regiment, and squadrons of Crocodile
flamethrowing tanks, flails, and AVREs supported by the fire of twenty-one artillery
regiments plus naval gunfire. The Canadians gained only Carpiquet village and suf-
fered 377 casualties, the Germans 155. Roy, 1944, 45-50; Stacey, Victory, 152-155;

22. It took four hours for armor to respond to the Royal Winnipeg Rifles' call
23. Improved coordination in itself would not have substantially improved.
Canadian tactical effectiveness because both infantry and armor lacked firepower.

25. General Montgomery later alleged that weather forecasts for some
evening bombing operation, but historians have disputed this explanation. Some
467 bombers dropped 2,562 tons of bombs, and French civilian losses exceeded
100. Montgomery, Normandy to the Baltic (London: Hutchinson, 1947), 73; Stacey,

he lucky result of wayward bombing. PRO WO 1/1A31, TRAG, Int. sum. I July
