Preparation: 1919-1944
without definitive and realistic doctrine, it proved very difficult to struc-
ture, organize, equip, and train the army appropriately.
The army's reluctance to open itself to honest, rigorous self-appraisal,
partly justified by morale concerns, further slowed the pace of reform. A
military institution that is unwilling to examine its problems cannot rectify
them. Class concerns also left senior officers reluctant to listen to advice
from the rank and file. Therefore, bottom-up innovation, the fastest and
most effective method of adaptation, was less widespread in the British
Army than in the U.S. and German Armies. Class differences hampered
efforts to improve coordination as socially exclusive ex-cavalry armor units
disdained cooperation with all except the Guards, the Greenjackets (the
Rifle Brigade), and the Royal Horse Artillery, for example.230 Moreover,
hierarchical army culture so elevated senior officers in stature that it vitiat-
ed criticism and ensured that any criticism in after-action reports was
euphemistic and diluted. Regimentalism too hampered development of
combined-arms coordination and uniform training. And deeply ingrained
regimental attitudes that were at the core of army culture could not be easi-
ly or quickly modified by initiatives from the top.
Armies reflect their societies. The British Army's approach to reform
reflected broader characteristics, values, and attitudes of British society.
That the army innovated from the top down reflected the influence of class
in British society. In the first four years of the war, the army proved slow
both to identify and then to disseminate lessons-learned experience, which
hobbled its ability to adapt and innovate at more than an incremental pace.

failure" illuminates this unwillingness to learn from mistakes.
