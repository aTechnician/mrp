The Canadian Army experienced its most extensive and costly combat
in Normandy. Canadian operations in the campaign fall into three distinct
phases: the meticulously rehearsed D-Day amphibious assault; the June-
July struggle to execute limited break-in battles; and the August efforts to
effect a breakthrough and fulfill the exploitation role that the Canadians
had prepared for in Britain.
In Normandy, there was a strong correlation between battlefield suc-

performed well in the carefully rehearsed amphibious assault, but experi-

With marked numerical and material superiority, and lengthy amphibi-

Armoured Brigade established themselves ashore with little difficulty on
D-Day. Landing on Juno beach, Canadian assault troops secured a 4-mile-
deep lodgement. The 3d Division had trained long and hard for its amphibi-
