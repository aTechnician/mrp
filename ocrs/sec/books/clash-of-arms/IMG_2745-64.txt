due to the heavy combat in Italy and a serious replacement shortage contributed to

strength and only vigorous rationalization brought units up to strength in time for
renewed offensive action in the spring. Lerwill, Personnel Replacement System,

Britain, 1939-1944:
Toils and Troubles
If mortal catastrophe should overtake the British nation, historians a
thousand years hence will never understand how it was that a victorious
nation suffered themselves to cast away all they had gained by measure-
less sacrifice.
—Winston Churchill
During the first three years of World War II the British Army suffered
some of the most disastrous defeats in its history. Repeated defeat pro-
foundly influenced the army's subsequent performance, and it was only
slowly and at heavy cost that it improved its combat proficiency. The army
proved slow to adapt because its culture and traditions, as well as its inter-
war neglect, had left it devoid of modern doctrine and without mecha-
nisms to evaluate its performance. At the same time, its disdain for intel-
lectual preparation ensured that the army extracted from its experiences
and those of its opponents support for its preconceived notions- that is,
that it learned better from its few successes than it did from its more fre-
quent reverses. 1
and equipped, unbalanced, undertrained, defense-minded, and vulnerable in
spirit. It lacked coherent, realistic doctrine, and was unready for interarms
and interservice cooperation. It was so tactically, materially, and mentally
unready for war that it was at best capable only of limited defense. The
hasty, haphazard, and incremental dispatch of the British Expeditionary
Force (BEF) to France during the fall of 1939 left it ill prepared to confront
the German Army because it lacked balance and cohesion. Moreover, many
of its officers were newly thrust into positions of responsibility for which
they had not been trained. Most serious of all, though, is that the BEF went
to France with a defensive mentality. Fundamentally, the BEF's condition
reflected the aversion of interwar British society to military preparedness
and renewed continental warfare.?
