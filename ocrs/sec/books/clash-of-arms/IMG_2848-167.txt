or attacking infantry." PRO WO 205/118, "Appreciation of Possible Development

June. Harrison, Attack, 381-384.
44. During 20-22 June only 8 percent of scheduled supplies arrived, and a fur-
ther 140,000 tons were delayed or destroyed. Not until early July did cargo dis-
charges return to prestorm levels. Consequently the First Army restricted artillery
fire to thirty rounds per gun between 22-24 June. FUSA, Report V, 183-186; VIII,

53. The number of WP rounds fired increased from 5,091 during 11-17 June
to 7,477 during 9-15 July. Such was its popularity that stocks ashore were perpetu-
ally low, and on 15 July the U.S. First Army had only 3,060 155mm WP rounds
ashore. FUSA Report V, 182-186; Leo P. Brophy, Wyndham D. Miles, and

S4. From 20 to 22, June the First Army airlifted 1,500 tons of munitions to
Normandy and a total of 6,620 tons by 31 July. Airlift remained, however, a novel
and limited means of resupply. During the campaign, the First Army fired 7,000.

result, stockpiles ashore fell by one-third and the First Army had to extend
