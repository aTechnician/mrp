Introduction
The soldier is the most conservative creature on earth. It is really danger-
ous to give him an idea, because he will not adopt it until it is obsolete,
and then will not abandon it until it has nearly destroyed him.

The Army possesses no inherent right to conceal the history of the U.S.
affairs behind a cloak of secrecy...

How well did the militaries of the Western Allies-Great Britain, Canada,
and the United States—as well as their enemy, Nazi Germany, perform in
the European Theater of Operations (ETO) during World War II? How flex-
ible and adaptable were they? How—and how well-did they learn from
their combat experience, and what impact did their ability to adapt have on
the course and outcome of the war? These questions constitute the core of
this book and they are examined in two parts. The first part of the work
explores how the Western Allied and the German militaries prepared in the
1919-1944 period for their decisive confrontation in World War II in the
ETO, the 1944 Normandy Campaign. The second part examines the per-
formance of these four militaries in Normandy between June and August
1944, where the audit of war tested the effectiveness of their preparation.
Victorious militaries are dynamic institutions that adapt to battlefield
conditions, which are both often impossible to predict and difficult to repli-
cate in peacetime, to ensure victory in war. The military profession 1s
unique because it is unable to practice realistically its profession in peace-
time. Militaries must prepare for future war at an indeterminate date,
against an uncertain enemy, with untested doctrine, tactics, organization,
and ordnance. 3 The audit of war thus invariably proves peacetime military
