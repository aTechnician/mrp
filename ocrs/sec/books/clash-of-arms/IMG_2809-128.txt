But lack of trucks meant the quartermaster general was unable to amass an
operational reserve exceeding 4,000 tons capacity (see Table 5.2). As the
Allied interdiction campaign systemicatically destroyed the French rail net-
work, it forced German supply operations onto the road during late spring
of 1944, eroding the serviceability rate of the strategic transport reserve
before D-Day. 173 By 6 June 1944 the German transportation situation in the
West was serious. Only with close interservice cooperation and strenuous
efforts to repair the French railroads could the Germans have hoped to ade-
quately resupply the forces on the invasion front. Given the progressive
paralyzation of the French rail network, if the Germans could not quickly
defeat the Allies on the beaches, they could not attain victory in Normandy.
This was the most debilitating deficiency the Westheer faced in its effort to
defeat the Allies. 174

The Westheer also lacked the ammunition and fuel to prevail if it did
not defeat the Allies on the beaches. The pressing needs of other theaters
had steadily depleted local stocks, a situation exacerbated by the massive
winter 1943-1944 retraining program. On 6 June, the priority fortresses
had about 30 days' worth of stockpiled ammunition, the coastal defenses
about 14 days', and there was an equal amount in inland dumps. 175 Fuel
shortages, especially gasoline, were even greater. Allied air attacks on the
German synthetic oil refineries and on the Romanian oil fields had already
cut production below consumption levels and forced the Westheer to ration
use of fuel on 3 June 1944.176 Only with stringent rationing, especially of
fuel for training, was the Westheer able to amass by D-Day a 7-10-day
stockpile for its strategic reserves, clearly insufficient for a lengthy cam-
paign. l77 After the first two weeks of combat, ammunition and fuel would

masters to decentralize reserve stocks to the field armies during the late
spring. Although this measure temporarily alleviated supply difficulties, in
the long term it served only to aggravate German resupply problems. Thus
by D-Day, the Allied air interdiction campaign had already tipped the mili-
tary balance toward the Allies. On 6 June 1944 over 1,700 trains, carrying
thousands of troops, hundreds of tanks and guns, and tens of thousands of
tons of materiel, were struggling toward their destinations. 178 The interdic-
tion campaign had already seriously compromised the German ability both
to redeploy forces to Normandy and to supply such forces once committed.
The question remained whether German logisticians could improvise and
adapt to overcome these serious, and increasingly debilitating,
During the spring of 1944, the Westheer had made remarkable progress
toward becoming a powerful counterinvasion force, but by D-Day this
process was still incomplete. In no small part the Westheer's lack of readi-
ness resulted from Hitler's insistence on overexpanding the Westheer, dissi-
pating resources, accentuating shortages, and exacerbating logistical diffi-
culties. Nevertheless, the defeats of 1942-1943 had reinforced the Heer's
determination to assess honestly its combat performance. Rigorous exami-
nation of its performance, followed by rapid and widespread dissemination
of lessons learned, allowed the Heer to enhance its defensive strength dur-
ing 1943-1944. And the greatest enhancement occurred in the neglected
Westheer. Yet nazi racial prejudices hampered retraining because German
perceptions of the Americans as a mongrel race incapable of military
prowess blinded the Germans to mounting evidence of improved U.S. com-
bat effectiveness since Tunisia. At the same time, the nazi view of the
British as Anglo-Saxon brethren ensured that an exaggerated sense of
British capabilities that were not borne out by experience- continued to
The Westheer underwent a profound metamorphosis during the spring
of 1944. Instead of widening the gap between Allied and German capabili-
ties, as the OVERLORD planners had hoped postponement of an invasion
attempt until 1944 would, the gap closed. In seven months the Westheer
had gained a limited counterinvasion capability: it substantially strength-
ened its coastal defenses and the forces defending them, and it built up a
strong strategic reserve.
Despite these measures, lack of supplies and the destruction of the
French rail system, which forced the Germans to depend on an utterly inad-
equate trucking capacity, meant that it was unlikely that the Westheer could
fight a protracted campaign unless it substantially improved its logistic sit-
