diers remained in Canada, some 55 percent of the entire Canadian Army. Ibid.,

31. The CAO's war establishment called for the maintenance of four months'
reinforcements at projected "intense" casualty rates. The most serious shortages
were for infantry and French-Canadian replacements. NAC, Crerar Papers Vol. 15,
letter, Crerar to CoS CMHQ, 21 May 1944.
32. The CAO's war establishment in January 1944 included 57,592 infantry.
In March the CAO had 39,742 replacements available in Britain. Burns, Manpower,
33. Stacey, Arms, 424-25.
34. The revised Evett rates increased the proportion of projected infantry casu-
alties to 70.8 percent. Burns, Manpower, 112.
35. Of 23,000 projected infantry replacements, the CAO had only 14,500, 43
percent of which were either serving in ad hoc units or were unfit. Unavailable
replacements comprised personnel serving in ad hoc units, replacements adjudged
unfit for combat service, and personnel earmarked for remustering but not yet
remustered. The practice of dumping "unfit" and "undesirable" personnel into the
replacement pool exacerbated Canadian manpower difficulties. Thus under 8,000
infantry replacements were actually available. Stacey, Arms, 425-427; Burns,
Manpower, Table 13, 91.
36. Only 20 percent of conscripts volunteered for active service. Stacey, Arms,
429; Burns, Manpower, Table 19, 121.
37. Even in 1944 only one-third of men called up were inducted, and the num-
ber of NRMA conscripts who converted to active service fell from 18,274 in 1942
to only 6,560 in 1943. Stacey, Arms, 429.
During April-May 1944 5,656 infantry reached Britain, and in early June a
further 2,000. Burns, Manpower, 88-89.

49. During exercise BEAVER IV (1-15 May 1942) in Sussex, for example,
the 2d Division ordered its 4th Brigade to concentrate in the middle of known
enemy territory, and during BEAVER V (22-24 May 1943) the umpires cheated to
prevent the 2d Division from overrunning Ist Division headquarters and thereby
bring the exercise to a premature end. NAC RG24 13611, HQ FCA, "Points Arising

training (Ottawa: 1 November 1943). The stated goal of the new standardized syl-

hour training week that with administration, sports, and processing, actually
involved 32 hours of training.
The evaluations were entitled Tests of Elementary
Training (TOETs). On the standardization of TOETs, see NAC RG24 13241, DND,
