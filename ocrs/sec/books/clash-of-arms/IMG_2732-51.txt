easier to supply, provision, maintain, and replenish. Mobility and maneu-
verability were also improved. Manpower economy allowed the army both
to augment its combat capabilities and to retain an adequate reservoir of
replacements. Reorganization increased the army's ability to sustain com-
bat power by trading off less self-sufficiency for more flexible, mobile, and
powerful combat formations, but without essentially altering the force
structure. Nor was rationalization achieved at the price of reducing support
facilities. The result was that when U.S. divisions joined combat in late
1942 they were leaner and meaner formations.
The army streamlined infantry division organization by paring excess
manpower and increasing firepower (see Table 2.1). Cutting divisional
manpower by 7 percent and transport by 23 percent reduced required ship-
ping space by 15 percent 36 At the same time, the army increased overall
firepower by adding regimental cannon companies, bazookas, and extra
machine guns and mortars. These reforms turned the infantry division into
a standard, general-purpose combined-arms fighting formation, stripped of
all nonessential specialist combat and support units.37
U.S. armored divisions underwent parallel reorganization and stream-
lining. The participation of an armored corps in the 1941 maneuvers led the
army to identify many flaws in its armored organization prior to commit-
ment to combat. Thus the tank-heavy, unbalanced, and cumbersome
armored divisions of 1940 gradually gave way to streamlined and well-
organized armored forces. In 1942, McNair's army review concluded that
the Armored Force was the most inefficient arm in its use of manpower and
equipment. The halting of the German blitzkrieg in North Africa and in the
Soviet Union, moreover, demonstrated that massed armor was not invinci-
ble. During 1942-1943 U.S. armored divisions became smaller, less tank-
heavy, and better balanced combined-arms formations as the army learned
from experience that armored formations required not only better balance
but also a genuine combined-arms doctrine.

Unfortunately, the army failed to appreciate fully the need for effective
interarms cooperation before 1944. The March 1942 armored division,
though an improvement on its 1940 predecessor, still remained tank-heavy
and short on infantry. 38 The first U.S. combat experience in the ETO result-
ed in a superior 1943 armored organization, which doubled the existing
infantry-tank ratio.39 Despite progress, however, the 1943 division still
lacked infantry,40 Combat experience in Sicily and Italy led to the introduc-
tion of the 1944 armored division, which continued the trends of earlier
reorganizations. Between 1940 and 1944, the organization of U.S. armored
divisions improved considerably (see Table 2.2). Total manpower fell by 25
percent and tank strength by one-third, while infantry strength rose 26 per-
cent. With all its infantry mounted on half-tracks and its entire artillery
self-propelled, the 1944 armored division had become a lean, flexible, and
highly mobile formation.

Armored organization also became more flexible because the army
evolved the combined-arms armored combat command. Based on combat
experience, the army increasingly divided armored divisions into three
mixed brigade groups termed combat commands. 41 The net effect of these
reorganizations was to create a more effective combined-arms team and to
shift the bulk of tank strength from armored divisions to infantry support.
The 1944 armored division remained both less flexible and less well bal-
anced a combined-arms team than its German counterpart and lacked its
punch, but it was better organized than its Anglo-Canadian equivalent. The
U.S. armored division's biggest weakness remained its lack of infantry-it
still had only three infantry battalions-and the policy of pooling prevented
integration of the tank destroyer and antiaircraft battalions that the Armored
Force repeatedly demanded. This lack of punch was offset by the increas-
ing use of the armored division by 1944 not in an attack role but as a lean,
mobile, and flexible formation designed to exploit a breakthrough.
A significant, indeed revolutionary, reorganization of the army during
1942-1943 was the introduction of a flexible battalion/group structure for
nondivisional troops. The army disbanded existing fixed brigades and regi-
