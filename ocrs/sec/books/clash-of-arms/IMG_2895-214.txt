replacements had arrived than the official statistics indicated. 62 Front-line
personnel shortages were also much less than statistics suggest because of
the three ways the Westheer responded to attrition to offset crippling casu-
alties and to sustain combat power. First, the Germans withdrew the cadres
of the most depleted subunits for complete rebuilding, while transferring
their remaining combat troops to other units. Second, they disbanded or
consolidated severely depleted units.63 Third, combat units absorbed
infantry-trained service troops and formed service personnel into infantry
alarm units.64 In such fashion the Germans minimized the impact of attri-
tion on their fighting power-
-and their forces in Normandy were on aver-
age about 14 percent understrength on the eve of COBRA, half the figure
estimated by Allied intelligence. 65

Likewise, despite heavy equipment losses, the German war economy
was able to dispatch sufficient replacements to cover most combat losses
(see Table 10.7).66 But Allied air attacks so delayed the arrival of replace-
ment personnel and equipment that front-line units became seriously
depleted. 67

If the German defense was not too weak to prevent a U.S. break-
through, why did the COBRA offensive succeed? Improved U.S. capabili-
ties resulted in a better conceived and executed offensive, but, equally
important, a deteriorating German supply situation contributed directly to
the Seventh Army's failure to halt the offensive. Thus the German defeat in
Normandy was fundamentally a logistic defeat,
for the Westheer proved
unable to reinforce and resupply a field force of sufficient size to contain
the Allies in their lodgement. Despite their endeavors, German quartermas-
ters were unable to keep their forces sufficiently supplied to maintain an
effective defense.
On D-Day the German logistic position in France was precarious.
Ammunition stockpiles were sufficient for about a month of sustained com-
bat, but most reserves were at inland dumps.68 The German fuel situation
was even worse; the Westheer had only seven to ten days' worth of fuel
avallable for its strategic reserves. Moreover, Allied air attacks had crippled
the French railway and forced the German supply operation onto the roads,
thereby further depleting German fuel stocks. So distribution was a serious
problem even before D-Day, and the Westheer had introduced stringent
rationing to preserve its dwindling supply. 69
