135. Wadell's recent study exaggerates the flaws of the U.S. Army supply sys-
tem and erroneously claims that it came close to failing. With the exception of
munitions, logisticians kept U.S. forces remarkably well supplied throughout the
campaign. See, for example, NARA RG 407, 1st Division, "Report on Activities,
G4 Section, July 1944," 4 August 1944, 2-3.

The troops have not the spirit essential to victory, our morale frightens
me.

Normandy, Summer 1944
If Tommy was a bit more of a soldier, he could push us anywhere he want-
ed to.

When one goes deeply into the Normandy operations, it is disturbing and
depressing to find how bad our performance was.
—Basil Liddell Hart, private correspondence, 19523
The eventual totality of Allied victory in Normandy has obscured the
British Army s lackluster performance in the campaign." british troops
proved less flexible, adaptable, and effective than their U.S. counterparts
and were unable to overcome enemy defenses. At the same time, mounting
losses sapped morale and led to a deterioration in performance as the cam-
paign progressed. British operations remained wedded to a methodical and
mechanistic attack doctrine built around the battalion assault and massive
coordinated fire plans. But British iveantry still lacked firepower, confi-
lence, and independence, and thus rarely reconnonered aggressively or
ped to outtank the enemy. While the infantry Proved store in the face
of trontal assaults they remained vulnerable lo enemy intufration and
Manking attacks, giving the Germans local successes out of all proportion

often "mortared off" or "challad" out of their positions and so had to relake
the same objectives repeatedly.
The continued variable perforal ance of British formations was as strik-
