Preparation: 1919-1944
September 1939, therefore, reflected genuine strategic constraints rather
than conservative opposition to change.
Nonetheless, Germany had started rearmament several years before its
neighbors, and although the Wehrmacht suffered from many deficiencies, it
remained better prepared than its rivals. In September 1939, Hitler thus
gambled that this imperfect instrument could quickly overwhelm
Germany's underprepared neighbors before they could mobilize their
resources, rearm, and eliminate the German lead. The result-which mate-
rialized as much by default as by rational planning-was the blitzkrieg
strategy of the early war years that transformed the global balance of
power.
In conclusion, Germany's strategic and political environment created a
climate conducive to innovation between the wars. However, factors
beyond the strategic and political environment allowed the German military
to innovate effectively in the interwar period: a combination of personali-
ties, experiences, and the character of German military culture made the
interwar German military receptive to new ideas. 164 The root of the brilliant
German successes of 1939-1941 thus lay in the bitter experience of defeat
in 1918 and in the army's determination to learn the operational and tactical
lessons of the Great War. The interwar German military explored and dis-
seminated these lessons diligently, flexibly, and with receptivity to new
ideas. Moreover, its awareness as to who Germany's future enemies were
and where they would be fought both eased the task of innovation and
focused it toward offensive ground warfare. The result was the blitzkrieg.
Blitzkrieg theory presented less of a challenge to the German military
because it believed that Germany had fought the Great War with correct
principles, and armor offered a solution to the problems that had brought
Germany defeat. Intellectual and doctrinal accommodation of the tank was
thus easier in Germany than in Britain. This reality explains why by 1939,
despite opposition in both countries, armored warfare had become a tenet
of German doctrine but failed to get similarly established in Britain.
Accommodation of armor within a realistic combined-arms doctrine
allowed Germany to succeed during 1939-1940 despite the fact that
Germany had devoted no more resources to mechanized forces than its ene-
mies. The key distinction, though, was that the Heer allowed innovators
greater freedom to develop radical, yet effective, means of employing new
weapons. Moreover, the Heer trained for fast, offensive, combined-arms,
mobile warfare and to ruthlessly exploit a breakthrough. By September
1939 the Heer was the only ground force in the world with an armored
force, albeit small, capable of independent strategic operations. This
edge-
-when combined with the realism and offense-orientation of German
doctrine, the quality of training and leadership, and the army's professional
willingness to evaluate honestly its performance and to retrain to improve
its proficiency-allowed Germany to achieve a spectacular series of mili-
