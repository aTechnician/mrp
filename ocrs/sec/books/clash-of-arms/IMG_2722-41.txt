artillery target acquisition, for example. The RAF in comparison developed radar
and two first-rate fighters, the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, and
then constructed an air defense system around these planes and radar that enabled
the RAF to win the Battle of Britain. Millett and Murray, Innovation in the Interwar
Period, iii; Bond and Murray, "British Armed Forces," 114.
40. Coordinated infantry and armor brought victory at Cambrai (fall 1917) and
Amiens (August 1918). But the other British victories in 1918 were traditional and
costly infantry-artillery battles. Basil Liddell Hart, The Tanks, 1914-1939 (London:
Cassell, 1959); Rosen, Winning the Next War; Travers, How the War Was Won;

41. The RTC comprised four tank battalions and eight armored car companies,
a major force in an army of only 200,000 men. The 1926-1934 EMF maneuvers
showed the potential of armored forces and illustrated that the army both possessed
innovative officers and was not opposed to reform. It was the interplay of financial
constraints and personalities that ultimately led to the disbandment of the EMF in
1934. Barton C. Hacker, "The Military and the Machine: An Analysis of the
Controversy over Mechanization in the British Army, 1919-1939," Ph.D. thesis,

Armoured Formations, 1929 (London: HMSO, 1929).

the British failure to develop a tank arm include Maj. L. F. Ellis, The War in France

43. Works that have stressed the officer corps social conservatism and faith in
cavalry include Anthony J. Trythall, Boney Fuller (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers

Hutchinson, 1967); and Correlli Barnett, Britain and Her Army, 1509-1970: A
Military, Political and Social Survey (London: Penguin Press, 1970). Recent schol-
arship has shown that historians have exaggerated the proportion and power of the
landed elite in the interwar officer corps and has demonstrated that the interwar
prestige of the cavalry declined considerably, and that by no means did all cavalry
officers oppose mechanization. Larson, Armoured Warfare, 15-32.

51. By the mid-1930s, aside from the royal arsenals, only Vickers Armstrong
remained of the more than thirty World War I arms factories. Bond and Murray,
52. The Vickers Medium of 1924 was the best tank of its day but the later
Mark I infantry tank was so mechanically unreliable that the army dared not display
it at the 1939 Aldershot Military Tattoo. Larson, Armoured Warfare, 222; David
Fletcher, The Great Tank Scandal (London: HMSO, 1989).
93. The 1924 Vickers Medium remained the mainstay of Britain's tank force
until 1937. In September 1939 Britain had 60 heavy tanks out of a total of 1,600. Sir
