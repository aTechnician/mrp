112. He showed considerable concern for the U.S. sector in June but only
because he perceived the strategic importance of Cherbourg, not because he recog-
nized American fighting capabilities.
113. Fighters available to the Luftflotte Reich fell from 991 on 1 June to 546
by 1 July. Williamson Murray, Luftwaffe (Baltimore, Md.: Nautical & Aviation
114. On D-Day Luftflotte III fielded 815 aircraft, of which approximately 600
were operational. Up to 19 June it lost 594 aircraft, or 75 percent of its original
establishment. It flew 13,829 sorties in June, one-tenth of the Allied total. Murray,
115. On 10-11, June transports dropped supplies to the 6th Parachute
Regiment at Carentan and during late June resupplied Cherbourg. Carell, Invasion,
116. During August 1944, Luftflotte III averaged 324 operational fighters, 67
night fighters, and 191 bombers. HERO, Interdiction from Falaise to Westwall, 193.
117. The IX U.S. TAC lost 80 aircraft from 25 July to 7 August, 73 percent to
ground fire and only 7 percent to enemy aircraft. Flak claimed the destruction of
2,024 Allied planes in July 1944 in Western Europe and 2,186 in August. At the
same time, antiaircraft guns consumed vast quantities of ammunition-it took on
average 5,000 light or 16,000 heavy rounds to down an aircraft-which aggravated
German supply shortages. H. A. Koch, Die Geschichte der Deutschen Flakartillerie

119. The Luftflatte III was reluctant to waste the III Flak Corps in ground
operations. It resisted army demands to allow the 32d Regiment to fire on ground
targets on D-Day at Omaha Beach. The battery that savaged British armor at Cagny
during GOODWOOD joined action only at the pistol point of an army officer, and
the OKL precipitously withdrew the corps on 18-19 August out of the Falaise pock-
et, which meant that the army could no longer halt the Allied advance. For exagger-
ated claims of the corps's role in GOODWOOD, see USAHD MS B-597, Gen.

more balanced assessment see Luck, Panzer Commander, 158-162.

chant ships in June. David Brown, Warship Losses In WWII (London: Arms &

121. Air attacks on Le Havre on 15 June crippled the German naval presence
in the eastern English Channel, sinking four large patrol ships and ten E-boats.
122. Of 43 U-boats dispatched, i2 turned back prematurely, 18 were sunk, and
only 13 completed their patrols. In all, U-boats sank 7 warships and 16 transports,
totaling only 55,000 tons. Ellis, Victory I, 295.
123. The Germans launched Neger attacks on 5-6, 7-8 and 29-30 July, and on
16-17 August. Biber craft attacked on 29-30 Aug, Linse on 2-3 and 8-9 August,
and fast landing boats (on 15 June. Erich Gröner, Die Schiffe der deutschen

124. The St. Marcouf battery held up the U.S. advance on Montebourg for five
days. In June coastal guns sank two warships and three merchant ships and dam-
aged eighteen vessels. Carell, Invasion, 127-133; Ingouf, Bataille de Cherbourg,

125. In June 1944 the Germans sank 261 Allied vessels, including twenty-four
warships and thirty-five merchant ships. Mines inflicted the most damage. Harnier,
Küstenkampf, 118-120.
126. However, because so few German troops fought both the Americans and
British prior to the breakout in late July, it was difficult for them to evaluate relative
British and U.S. capabilities. Those who did were adamant that the Americans were
superior. PRO WO 171/258, I Corps Int. Sum. 26, July 1944, "Combat Report,

127. Trevor Dupuy's extensive statistical analysis of divisional combat per-
formance in World War Il indicates that German combat superiority diminished as
the war progressed. While Dupuy's research is valuable, it is overly reductive and
misses the reality that raw combat power per se cannot guarantee combat success
and that immediate German combat power was bought at the expense of sustained
combat strength. Trevor Dupuy, Understanding War (London: Leo Cooper, 1992),
