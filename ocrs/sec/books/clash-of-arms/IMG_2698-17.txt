Introduction
new environments, refining doctrine, improving weapons, and modifying
tactics in the process. The triumph of the Allies in World War II demon-
strates this reality. Although constant German adaptation and innovation
delayed defeat and increased the price of victory, the Allies progressively
enhanced their combat effectiveness during the war to erode the qualitative
eage the Germans possessed in 1939. Ultimately the law of numbers pre-
vailed, and Allied numerical and material superiority overwhelmed Nazi
Germany. At the same time, the considerable flexibility and adaptability
exhibited by the U.S. military played an important role in the Allied tri-
umph over the evil of National Socialism. For during the last year of the
war the U.S. Army did not simply overwhelm an increasingly outnumbered
and outgunned enemy, but it learned on the battlefields of Normandy to
outfight the nazi war machine.
