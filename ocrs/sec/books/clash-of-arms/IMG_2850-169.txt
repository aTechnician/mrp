96. Some 3,300 planes, including 1,800 heavy and 396 medium bombers and
559 fighter-bombers, plus 500 fighters, participated, making it the largest air opera-
tion in support of ground forces up to that time. The short bombing on 24-25 July
caused 757 casualties and killed Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair, the Army Ground
Forces commander. Craven and Cate, AAF, III, 231-234; Blumenson, Breakout,

the German artillery to open up and reveal its location, which greatly aided the CB
program the next day. Blumenson, Breakout, 238-239.
