81. In the Far East, marginally more numerous Japanese forces rapidly over-
ran Malaya and Singapore against inadequately trained, badly led, ill-equipped,
dispirited, and ill-prepared British forces. Both strategic overstretch and racial prej-
udice contributed to the debacle. Ivan Simson, Singapore: Too Little, Too Late

bad morale. Morale dropped so alarmingly during 1940-1942 that the War Office
set up the Morale Committee to evaluate its causes and offer remedies. PRO WO
83. Ultra initially proved of limited help to the Allies in North Africa. Only
after mid-1942 did it bring frequent interception of Axis resupply convoys and the
slow strangulation of German logistics. Ronald Lewin, Ultra Goes to War (London:
