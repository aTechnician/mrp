210. Montgomery's ideas, for instance, differed strikingly from War Office
doctrine over armored organization and the infantry-cruiser tank distinction. Letters
from Montgomery to Lt. Gen. A. E. Nye, 28.8. and 7.12.1943, and replies 7.10 and
21 December 1943 in Brooks, ed., Montgomery, 274-275, 342-346.

213. He summarized the tenets of his approach in his address of 20 March
1944. "Montgomery's Notes for Address to Senior Officers, Second Army, 20
March 1944," quoted in Nigel Hamilton, Monty: Master of the Battlefield,
1942-1944 (London: H. Hamilton, 1983), 549-550.
214. GHQ Home Forces, Doctrine for the Tactical Handling of the (New
Model) Division and Armoured Division (London: HMSO, October 1942), 3.
215. Doctrine called for armor to exploit gaps in the enemy defenses created
by the infantry break-in. This emphasis on exploitation left armored formations
deficient in striking power. Ibid., 1-2.
216. This was evident in that the War Office designed its Notes from the
Theatres of War and Current Reports from Overseas publications primarily for
Home Forces.

1945).
218. The range of Allied fighters increased from 175 miles in May 1943
(Spitfire) to 600 miles in spring 1944 (P-51 with drop tanks). Williamson Murray,
Luftwaffe (Baltimore: Nautical & Aviation, 1985), 166-168.
219. Four attacks on Hamburg during July-August 1943 shattered the city and
killed 50,000 civilians. Martin Middlebrook, The Battle of Hamburg: Allied Bomber
Forces Against a German City in 1943 (London: Allen Lane, 1980), chap. 15.
220. Loss rates for the 8th USAAF peaked in October 1943 at 26 percent for
planes and 37 percent for crews. Murray, Luftwaffe, 162-170.
221. The officer-enlistee ratio dropped from 1:15 in 1939 to 1:13 in 1945.

223. Dempsey remains the least understood senior British wartime command-
er. An introvert, he shielded himself from public scrutiny throughout his career.
Early in the war he rose from brigadier to corps command. LHCMA, LHP 1/230,
London Times obituary of Dempsey, 7 June 1969; Brian Horrocks, Corps
Commander (London: Sidgewick & Jackson, 1977), 22-24; Hart, Montgomery,

Montgomery rated Agair as unsuited for divisional command, but
O'Connor refused to replace him. Baynes, Forgotten Victor, 180.
229. British military thinking termed the operational level "grand tactics,"
which falsely implied that operational art was merely an extension of tactics on a
larger scale. Operations involve the control and direction of armies and army groups
within a single, discrete combat theater. Trevor Dupuy, Understanding War: History
and Theory of Combat (New York: Paragon, 1987), 70-71.
