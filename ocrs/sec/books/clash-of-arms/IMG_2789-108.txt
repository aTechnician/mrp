Preparation: 1919-1944
2. Illustrative of the lack of quality control in early war enlistment was the
discharge of 453 soldiers before June 1941 as mentally ill, including thirty-six cate-
gorized as psychopaths. C. P. Stacey and Barbara M. Wilson, The Half-Million: The
Canadians in Great Britain, 1939-1945 (Toronto: Toronto University Press, 1986),

4. In the spring of 1939 the Canadian military possessed only sixteen light
tanks, twenty-nine Bren guns, twenty-three antitank rifles, four modern antiaircraft
guns, four antitank guns, five mortars, and 122 automobiles. Stacey, Six Years of
War: The Army in Canada, Britain and the Pacific (Ottawa: Queen's Printer, 1955),
5. Shortages of 40mm Bofors antiaircraft guns, for example, delayed the for-
mation of light antiaircraft regiments until 1943. Stacey, Six Years, 242.
6. Canada was only able to expand production rapidly in 1941 where it had
retained a peacetime capacity. Thus in 1941 Canada produced 17,800 Bren guns,
1,300 artillery pieces, and 189,000 motor vehicles. In 1940 Canada began produc-
ing British 25-pounder guns, 2-inch mortars, 40mm Bofors guns, and Valentine
7. In 1940-1941 the United States provided 250 obsolete M17 light tanks,
20,000 Enfield rifles, twenty-five 37mm antitank guns, and sixteen 155mm how-
itzers. Col. Stanley W. Dziuban, Military Relations Between the U.S. and Canada,
1939-1945 (Washington, D.C.: Office of the Chief of Military History, DOA,
1959), 91-94.
8. In May 1940 Canada sent 75,000 Ross rifles and 60 million small-arms
rounds to Britain. By late
1940 Britain had placed contracts in Canada for 300
tanks, 72,434 vehicles, 3,450 guns, and 100,000 rifles. Stacey, Arms, 35-36.

10. For example, the 2d Armoured Brigade, earmarked to spearhead the D-
Day assault had only 6 percent of its authorized armor in January 1944, and only 2
percent of Canadian-built Valentine tanks saw service with Canadian forces. Public

Canadian gunners, for example, initially trained with obsolete 18-pounders
and 4.5-inch howitzers. Light antiaircraft guns, 4.2-inch mortars, and PIATS all
remained scarce until 1944. The 4th Armoured Division first test-fired with its M10
tank destroyers in May 1944 and had still not received its full complement of
Sherman tanks by D-Day. National Archives of Canada Record Group 24 [NAC RG

15. Tactical doctrine involves the teaching of tactics, the conceptual constructs
that govern the tactics of an army. The term strategic doctrine is less widely used
because the ideas and considerations that govern national strategic decisionmaking
are rarely inculcated in officers and troops, but remain the preserve of senior mili-
English, Canadians, chap. 3.

ing staff officers for high operational command. English, Canadians, 100.
18. Some 67 percent of the 4,963 Canadian ground troops committed at
Dieppe became casualties, and only 2,211 returned. The worst hit battalion, the
Essex Scottish, extricated 10 percent of its committed troops. NAC RG24 c2

23. The government's unwillingness to tackle draft evasion makes it difficult
to assess its scale. In April 1944 the government listed 13.5 percent of those men
called for military service as evaders. But it prosecuted only 19 percent of these,
and punishments consisted of fines or short imprisonments. Thus most evaders were
neither traced nor prosecuted. Stacey, Arms, 414-415.
24. In March 1944 French Canadians made up 19 percent of the army and 14
percent of officers. The proportion of male Ottawans who served in the Canadian
armed forces in World War Il was double that of Quebec. Canada raised from
French Canadians one engineer and four infantry battalions, as well as an artillery
regiment. Officer shortages prevented the formation of an envisaged French-
Canadian brigade, however. Stacey, Arms, 421-424.

CAR personnel remained in Canada organized in 3 divisions, 8 brigades, and 42
infantry battalions. Burns, Manpower, 133-135.
