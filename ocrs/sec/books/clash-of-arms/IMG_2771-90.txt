an antitank and antiaircraft gun troop, and a motorized infantry company. They
were named after Maj. Gen. "Jock" Campbell VC who first used them during CRU-
SADER. Contemporaries often overstated their value: they were too small and wul-
employed piecemeal too often to do more than harass the enemy. On their useful-

The lack of suitable tactical strike aircraft reflected the prevalent prewar
notion that only specialized attack planes could provide effective tactical support.
The American Brewster Bermuda and Vultee Vengeance purchased during
1940-1941 proved failures. In March 1941, tactical aviation averaged a mere four-
teen sorties daily in North Africa. Owen Thetford, Aircraft of the RAF Since 1918
