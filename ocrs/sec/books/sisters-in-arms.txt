Sisters in Arms
During the Second World War some 600,000 women were absorbed into
the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force, the Auxiliary Territorial Service, and the
Women’s Royal Naval Service. These women performed important military
functions for the armed forces, both at home and overseas, and the jobs they
undertook ranged from cooking, typing and telephony to stripping down
torpedoes, overhauling aircraft engines and operating the ﬁre control
instruments in anti-aircraft gun batteries. In this wide-ranging study,
which draws on a multitude of sources and combines organisational history
with the personal experiences of servicewomen, Jeremy Crang traces the
wartime history of the WAAF, ATS and WRNS and the integration of
women into the British armed forces. Servicewomen came to play such an
integral wartime role that the military authorities established permanent
regular post-war women’s services and, in so doing, opened up a military
career for women for the ﬁrst time.

Jeremy A. Crang is Professor of Modern British History at the University of
Edinburgh. He is the author of The British Army and the People’s War,
1939–1945 (2000) and co-editor (with Paul Addison) of The Burning Blue:
a New History of the Battle of Britain (2000); Firestorm: the Bombing of
Dresden, 1945 (2006); Listening to Britain: Home Intelligence Reports on
Britain’s Finest Hour, May to September 1940 (2010); and The Spirit of the
Blitz: Home Intelligence and British Morale, September 1940–June 1941
(2020). He is also co-editor (with Edward Spiers and Matthew Strickland)
of A Military History of Scotland (2012).

In recent years the ﬁeld of modern history has been enriched by the exploration of
two parallel histories. These are the social and cultural history of armed conﬂict, and
the impact of military events on social and cultural history.
Studies in the Social and Cultural History of Modern Warfare presents the fruits of
this growing area of research, reﬂecting both the colonization of military history by
cultural historians and the reciprocal interest of military historians in social and
cultural history, to the beneﬁt of both. The series offers the latest scholarship in
European and non-European events from the 1850s to the present day.

PROLOGUE

When you see a girl in khaki or air-force blue with a bit of ribbon on
her tunic – remember she didn’t get it for knitting more socks than
anyone else in Ipswich.1

At 1.00 am on 31 May 1940 twenty-nine-year-old Corporal Daphne
Pearson, a medical orderly in the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and
former manager of the Ditton Court farm shop near Maidstone in Kent,
was asleep in her bunk in the women’s quarters at RAF Detling.
Suddenly she was woken by the noise of an Avro Anson – of Coastal
Command’s 500 Squadron – returning from operations. Although she
was accustomed to the drone of these aircraft, the tone of the engines
indicated that something was wrong. Instinctively, Pearson pulled
a jersey and pair of trousers over her pyjamas and, clad in tin hat and
wellington boots, rushed outside in time to see the stricken Anson crashland in ﬂames in an adjacent ﬁeld. Ignoring calls for her to keep away,
she scrambled through a ditch of nettles towards the red glow of the
crash site. On arriving at the scene, two of the injured aircrew had
managed to extract themselves from the aircraft, but the pilot, Pilot
Ofﬁcer David Bond, was more seriously hurt. Although the Anson was
ablaze, and there were fuel and bombs on board ready to detonate,
Pearson courageously stood on the burning wreckage, roused the
stunned pilot and assisted in getting him clear. When Bond had been
moved some thirty yards away from the aircraft, a 120 lb bomb went off
and Pearson threw herself on top of the pilot in order to protect him
from the splinters and debris of the explosion. The blast was so strong

that others arriving to assist were said to have been blown over like tents
in a gale force wind. After helping Bond onto a stretcher, and despite the
risk of further detonations, Pearson returned to the Anson to search for
the missing wireless operator, but found him dead. She then helped to
remove fragments of metal from the injured airmen in a makeshift
operating theatre at the base before they were transferred elsewhere.
Having snatched a few hours sleep, she calmly reported back to the sick
bay at 8.00 am to resume her normal duties. In recognition of her role in
helping to save Bond’s life that night, Pearson was awarded the Empire
Gallantry Medal. The following year she was presented with the George
Cross, which had superseded the EGM. She was the ﬁrst woman to
receive the GC: the nation’s highest civilian award for gallantry and
equal in status to the Victoria Cross.2 ‘The bravery of Corporal Joan
Daphne Pearson’, wrote one wartime commentator, ‘ . . . has become
a matter of national pride.’3
During the Second World War approximately 600,000 women
were absorbed into three British women’s auxiliary services: the

Women’s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), the Auxiliary Territorial Service
(ATS) and the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS). At their peak
strengths, the WAAF numbered 182,000, the ATS 213,000 and the
WRNS 74,000 (see Table 1 in appendix).4 Women from all parts of
the United Kingdom, and beyond, served in these forces. In the ATS, for
example, of the approximately 208,000 auxiliaries embodied at the end
of 1943, 162,900 had been born in England, 25,700 in Scotland, 7,300
in Wales, 1,900 in Northern Ireland, 3,000 in Eire and 3,500 in India,
the Dominions or the British colonies. An additional 1,300 personnel
were of British nationality born outside the British empire and a further
2,200 were of foreign nationality (chieﬂy German, Polish, Austrian,
Czech and Russian).5 These servicewomen were generally young in
age. Of the 445,200 female personnel across the three women’s services
in the summer of 1943, over half were aged twenty-two or under.
A quarter were twenty or under.6
The WAAF, ATS and WRNS performed a variety of military
functions in support of the RAF, army and Royal Navy, both at home
and overseas, and in many cases women served alongside men. The jobs
they undertook ranged from cooking, typing and telephony, to stripping
down torpedoes, overhauling aircraft engines and operating the ﬁre
control instruments in anti-aircraft gun batteries. Some 1,500 women
died during their war service.7 Churchill himself contributed a daughter
to each of these forces – Sarah to the WAAF, Mary to the ATS and Diana
to the WRNS8 – but perhaps the most notable recruit was the King’s
elder daughter: eighteen-year-old Princess Elizabeth. She joined the ATS
in early 1945 as No. 230873 Second Subaltern Windsor and was trained
as a driver, and in vehicle maintenance, at No. 1 Mechanical Transport
Training Centre in Camberley. Although the heir to the throne could
never be just ‘one of the girls’, and returned to Windsor each night to
sleep, she reminisced that it was the ﬁrst time in her life that she had been
able to measure herself against her contemporaries in any collective
activity.9 The ATS provided a contingent for the guard of honour at
her wedding in Westminster Abbey in 1947.10
This book is intended as a contribution to the historiography of
the wartime British armed forces. Military historians have, perhaps
understandably, concentrated their attention on the male services.11
The aim here is to investigate their female counterparts. A number of
valuable historical studies have been published of these forces during the
war, but they have tended to focus on individual services,12 or on

particular servicewomen, such as the much-publicised ATS ‘gunners’ (of
whom Mary Churchill was one) who helped to engage German aircraft
and ﬂying bombs over Britain.13 This volume deals with all three services
and investigates a range of aspects of service experience, in the hope of
broadening our understanding of these wartime auxiliary institutions and
the integration of women into the British armed forces. Drawing on
a variety of sources, it begins with a discussion of the re-establishment
of the three women’s services shortly before the outbreak of hostilities. It
then moves onto an examination of the wartime history of these forces.
This is explored in a series of thematic chapters covering various features
of service life during the conﬂict. It ends with the creation of the permanent regular post-war women’s services which, for the ﬁrst time, offered
a career for women with their ‘parent’ armed forces.
At the end of the war, Flight Ofﬁcer Daphne Pearson (as she
then was after receiving a commission in 1940) was demobilised from
the WAAF. After a period as an assistant governor at H. M. Prison,
Aylesbury, she joined the staff of the Herbarium at the Royal Botanic

Gardens, Kew, and established her own plant nursery and shop in the
village. In the late 1950s Pearson, who was not in the best of health,
moved to Australia. There she worked as a horticulturist for the
Department of Civil Aviation and helped create international-standard
gardens around the new Tullamarine (Melbourne) airport. She, however,
returned to Britain regularly for reunions of the Victoria Cross and
George Cross Association and in 1995, during a visit to take part in the
commemorative events to mark the ﬁftieth anniversary of victory in
Europe, enjoyed an emotional meeting with the family of Pilot Ofﬁcer
Bond. After the conﬂict, Bond had founded what would become the
world’s largest civilian helicopter group with its headquarters in
Aberdeen. Although he had died in 1977 without having had the opportunity of seeing Pearson again, his sons, who had seen pictures of her in
the press being presented to the Queen Mother along with the story of her
award, wished to thank her in person for her part in saving their father in
1940. They therefore arranged to ﬂy the eighty-three-year-old wartime
heroine up to Scotland for a special celebratory lunch at the Raemoir
House Hotel in Banchory.14 ‘We owe a great debt to Daphne’, they later
wrote ‘ – our very existence’.15 For her, it was an equally memorable
occasion: ‘I just wanted to cry when they got in touch with me. I have
found a whole new family.’16
In 2000 Daphne Pearson passed away. Her GC is now among the
collections of the Imperial War Museum, as is Dame Laura Knight’s
evocative wartime portrait of her. This picture was painted for the
Ministry of Information’s War Artists’ advisory committee during the
height of the Battle of Britain in late August and early September 1940.17
During the sitting, Pearson, who was ‘full of conﬂictions’ because she was
absent from her RAF station while the battle was raging, stayed at the
British Camp Hotel at Wynd’s Point near Malvern and it seems likely that
the picture was painted in the nearby garden of Sir Barry Jackson, a close
friend of Knight and her husband. A sun-burned Pearson reported in
a letter to her mother that Knight had initially depicted her holding a riﬂe
which, in tandem with the tin helmet perched on the back of Pearson’s
head like a woman’s bonnet, would make ‘a good line’. Pearson was
much in favour of this combative portrayal: ‘If Germans kill women and
children deliberately in their homes and in the streets, machine-gunning –
then the women must be prepared to kill to protect their children’. But
such an image was controversial since airwomen were not permitted to
carry arms and she admitted that ‘the Air Min. will be furious’.18 In the

end, a respirator was inserted in place of the riﬂe. ‘The irony of the gun
was over-ruled by using a gas mask’, recalled Pearson, ‘[but] in truth no
way would one open up a gas mask in such an artistic manner.’19 The
replacement of a riﬂe with a respirator – the apparatus of life over that of
death – tells us something about the gender tensions surrounding the
service of women with the British armed forces during the war and the
challenges they faced in entering the male military bastion.

1 REVIVAL
The First World War and Its Immediate Aftermath
During the First World War, various independent women’s
organisations assisted the armed forces. These included such bodies as
the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), which ran an ambulance
service, and the Women’s Legion, which deployed cookery and motor
transport sections. Faced, however, with a manpower crisis as a result of
the casualties on the western front, the military authorities were forced
to establish their own ofﬁcial uniformed women’s auxiliary services
with the aim of combing out non-combatant servicemen who were ﬁt
for frontline service. The Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was
established in March 1917, the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS)
in November 1917 and the Women’s Royal Air Force (WRAF) in
April 1918 – the latter being created on the same day as the RAF. The
members of these women’s services retained their civilian status and
performed mainly ‘feminine’ roles, such as domestic, clerical and telephonist work, in support of their male ‘parent’ forces. Some 95,000
women served in these organisations at home and overseas.1
In the immediate aftermath of the war there was some discussion in military circles over whether the women’s services should be
retained as part of the permanent strength of the armed forces. But
against a backdrop of contracting defence spending, as well as an antifeminist reaction in some quarters towards women in uniform which
associated them with ‘unnatural’ masculine traits, this was not

considered a priority by the male service establishment. The WRNS, the
WRAF and the WAAC (which had been renamed Queen Mary’s Army
Auxiliary Corps) were thus disbanded during the period 1919–21.2 The
creation of a women’s reserve organisation might have been a cheaper
and less contentious alternative. In 1920 a War Ofﬁce committee under
Major-General Basil Burnett-Hitchcock put forward proposals for the
establishment of a ‘Queen’s Reserve’ of women which would be
afﬁliated to the Territorial Army and would act as the cadre for an
expanded women’s service in time of war. The Army Council concluded, however, that such a body was ‘not desirable at the present
time’ and let the matter drop.3 Although the FANY (which increasingly
became a general transport unit rather than a purely ambulance corps)
and the Women’s Legion (whose motor transport section remained
active) continued to offer a quasi-military role for a few middle- and
upper-class enthusiasts in the post-war years – both bodies turning out
to support the army during the general strike of 1926 – no ofﬁcial
women’s service existed.4 Women were once more excluded from the
servicemen’s sphere.

The (New) Women’s Legion and the Emergency Service
The ﬁrst tentative steps that would eventually lead to a revival
of the women’s auxiliary services were taken in the early 1930s. The
initiative came from the Marchioness of Londonderry, the renowned
political and society hostess, who had founded the Women’s Legion in
1915 and continued to preside over it after the war. Londonderry was
anxious about growing tensions in Europe and the need for women to
prepare for a role in national defence in a future conﬂict. She was also
agitated by the formation of a new rival paramilitary women’s organisation: the Women’s Reserve. The brainchild of ‘Commandant’ Mary
Allen, a former wartime policewoman and jackbooted fascist sympathiser, this shadowy enterprise was intended to combat left-wing subversion and threatened to undermine the Marchioness’s own organisation,
the Women’s Legion, as well as the FANY. As a result of these concerns,
Londonderry, whose Unionist husband was serving in Ramsay
MacDonald’s cabinet as Secretary of State for Air, sought the approval
of the military authorities in late 1933 for a new and expanded
Women’s Legion under her presidency. This would act as an umbrella
organisation for the established independent women’s bodies and

provide a national pool of trained women who could be mobilised to
perform ancillary tasks for the armed forces in an emergency.5
The service ministries could see the advantages of dealing with
one representative organisation and gave a guarded welcome to the (new)
Women’s Legion.6 But it became apparent that the individual services had
different conceptions of the role of this body. The Air Ministry – perhaps
unsurprisingly – was the most enthusiastic department. It envisaged that
the new legion would train women to undertake speciﬁed duties for the
wartime RAF and that a grant would be required from the air force
budget to cover the costs. The War Ofﬁce was more cautious and contemplated that the organisation would merely register women who would
be ready to serve in the army in an emergency with no call made upon
army funds. As for the Admiralty, it had grave doubts as to whether the

scheme could fulﬁl any useful purpose for the Royal Navy and questioned
the political expediency of endorsing an initiative that could be interpreted as an early public preparation for war.7 As a result of the impasse,
the Marchioness’s enterprise began to run into the sand.
Meanwhile, in the summer of 1934 Londonderry approached
Dame Helen Gywnne-Vaughan to work under her as chairman of the
new legion. Gwynne-Vaughan, Professor of Botany at Birkbeck College,
and a former deputy head of the WAAC and head of the WRAF during
the First World War, agreed to take on this role. It was, however, an
uneasy partnership. According to her biographer, Molly Izzard, the new
chairman was not accustomed to running other people’s ‘shows’ and
carried with her the professional woman’s resentment of prominent
society ladies, such as the Marchioness, who received all the plaudits
for their patriotic endeavours but seemed to do little of the hard work.
She also disliked Londonderry’s close friendship with MacDonald,
whose anti-war stance during the previous conﬂict made him
a thoroughly discredited ﬁgure in her eyes. These irritations, and a lack
of worthwhile activity for the new legion, encouraged Gwynne-Vaughan
to consider setting up her own organisation.8
The immediate consequence was her proposal for an ofﬁcers’
training section within the legion. This would provide a much-needed
pool of trained ofﬁcers ready to lead any women’s auxiliary services that
might be required in wartime.9 Early in 1936 she submitted her plans to
the War Ofﬁce and the Air Ministry; the Admiralty was no doubt
regarded by this stage as an unlikely participant.10 In a letter to the
Adjutant-General, Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Knox, she envisaged
the training of ‘daughters of senior ofﬁcers and so forth – who may
have inherited some of their fathers’ qualities’.11 Knox was sympathetic
to the proposed scheme, but could not resist a little gentle teasing of the
redoubtable Dame Helen: ‘You very rightly have a great regard for the
qualities of senior ofﬁcers,’ he replied ‘but I trust that some of their
daughters have not inherited quite all the qualities of some senior ofﬁcers
whom I have known. If they have, it may be a source of trouble to you!’12
In the interim the question of the (new) Women’s Legion had
been referred to a women’s reserve subcommittee of the Committee of
Imperial Defence (CID). Chaired by Sir William Graham Greene,
a former Permanent Secretary of the Admiralty, this reported in the
spring of 1936. Having investigated the armed forces’ requirements for
women in the early stages of an emergency, and contemplated the

11 / The (New) Women’s Legion and the Emergency Service
administrative chaos that was likely to arise by involving an independent, amateur body in the machinery of government, the committee
concluded that the creation of a women’s reserve organisation was ‘not
desirable’; that no public money should be made available to any
independent scheme that might be set up for this purpose; and that in
the event of war the Ministry of Labour was the proper authority to
whom the service departments should turn for womanpower.13 Only
the Air Ministry seems to have regretted this verdict. It faced the prospect of immediate air attack on the outbreak of war and believed that
Londonderry’s enterprise could best provide the categories of trained
women that it would require at a few hours’ notice. This view remained
a minority one.14
The CID committee’s ruling in effect killed the (new) Women’s
Legion: later that year it was wound up, the FANY and the (old)
Women’s Legion continuing as separate entities.15 A lifeline was, however, offered to Gywnne-Vaughan’s ofﬁcers’ training section. It was
recommended by the Greene committee that the service departments
should have discretion to provide limited assistance to organisations
such as hers that might be of value to them in preparing women for
duties of a ‘supervisory capacity’.16 As a result, in the summer of 1936
her section was reconstituted as an independent body and renamed the
Emergency Service: a title designed to avoid any overtly warlike connotations since indications of belligerence were still regarded as politically undesirable as appeasement unfolded. Dame Helen served as
chairman and Viscountess Trenchard, an old friend and wife of the
‘father’ of the RAF, as vice-chairman. The Duchess of Gloucester agreed
to act as patron.17
Membership was by personal invitation and Trenchard’s
daughter, Belinda Boyle, did much of the early recruiting by simply
leaﬁng through her address book for likely candidates. Most of
those who joined had service connections and the members came
to include Lady Olive Newall, whose husband was Chief of the Air
Staff, Lady Dorothy Bowhill, who was married to the Air Member
for Personnel, and Lady Dorothy Jackson, wife of the General
Ofﬁcer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command.18 Among the
less judicious enrolments was that of Unity Mitford, the pro-Nazi
daughter of Lord Redesdale. Her extreme political views threatened
to harm the reputation of the organisation and deter others from
participating. When rumours began to circulate that she intended to

2 8:

12 / Revival
become a German citizen, Gwynne-Vaughan asked her to leave.
Obligingly, Mitford withdrew.19
Training of the recruits was soon underway. Evening classes on
ofﬁcership were conducted by members with previous service experience at Regent’s Park barracks and the headquarters of 601 Squadron in
London, and the War Ofﬁce and Air Ministry provided lectures on
aspects of military administration. An annual camp was also held at
Abbot’s Hill school in Hemel Hempstead at which the ‘cadets’ did
‘physical jerks’, practised drills, took it in turns to give each other
orders, and prepared unappetizing meals using the manual of military
cookery.20 ‘Most of our friends and relations’, recalled Boyle, ‘thought
us not only mad but bad’.21 Altogether some 400 women received
training as potential ofﬁcers.22
While the Emergency Service was establishing itself,
‘Commandant’ Mary Allen reappeared on the scene. In the autumn of
1936, she managed to secure an interview with the Minister for CoOrdination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip, to discuss the role of her
Women’s Reserve in national defence. To assist Inskip, the Home Ofﬁce
compiled a conﬁdential report on Allen’s previous activities. It transpired that after the First World War this maverick ﬁgure had headed
the Women Police Service, an unofﬁcial body intended to train women
for the police forces, and in 1921 she had been ﬁned ten shillings for
wearing a uniform resembling that of the police. Her organisation had
subsequently been renamed the Women’s Auxiliary Service and, in
connection with women’s congresses, she had visited Berlin in 1929
and Rio de Janeiro in 1931, where she had apparently posed as chief of
the British women police. This masquerade had led to complaints about
her behaviour from the National Council of Women of Great Britain. In
1933 she formed the Women’s Reserve and had been roundly condemned in the press by Londonderry for creating an avowedly militarist
organisation that would lead to overlap and confusion with other
bodies.23 Most damningly of all, New Scotland Yard conﬁrmed that
she was a ‘secret adherent’ of Sir Oswald Mosley’s British Union of
Fascists and likely to use her contacts to provide information for this
organisation.24 Predictably, Allen was politely informed that a CID
committee had ruled on the issue of a women’s reserve and her services
were not required.25
At this point, Lady Margaret Loch entered the fray. Loch, the
wife of Major-General Lord Loch, headed the Women’s Legion Flying

Section, a branch of Londonderry’s organisation that had been established in the early 1930s to train female pilots and ground crew.26 In the
summer of 1936, she approached the War Ofﬁce about the possibility of
the Women’s Legion selecting a small number of ‘suitable’ women to be
trained for ‘supervisory work’ with the armed forces in time of war.
Loch, who had no connection with Gwynne-Vaughan’s Emergency
Service, was advised to consult the Ministry of Labour. The ministry
took the view that her proposal was chieﬂy a matter for the service
departments. In the spring of 1937, she contacted the army authorities
again. The War Ofﬁce was by this stage concerned about the possibility
of confusion and overlap between Loch’s venture and the Emergency
Service. As a result, it was suggested to the Ministry of Labour that there
would be administrative advantages if the ministry coordinated the
provision of ofﬁcer personnel in the same way that it had been tasked
by the CID committee to oversee the supply of other ranks. The ministry
responded that it had in fact interpreted its role as applying to all classes
of women required by the services and that it would undertake to
furnish ofﬁcers. In order to effect this, it was proposed that on the
outbreak of war the ministry would commandeer the membership
records of the various women’s organisations. These ﬁles would indicate
which women had the requisite qualiﬁcations and training to make
suitable ofﬁcers.27
On the basis of these discussions General Knox wrote to Loch
and Gwynne-Vaughan in the summer of 1937. He informed them that
in a national emergency the War Ofﬁce would obtain all its female
personnel, including the ‘supervisory class’, from the Ministry of
Labour and in order to facilitate this process the ministry intended to
take over the records of the women’s bodies at an appropriate time.
Although reassurances were given that assistance would continue to be
provided in the form of military lectures, he bluntly told them that ‘we
at the War Ofﬁce shall have no direct dealings with any women’s
organization in future as regards the supply of personnel’.28 Loch
passed the letter to Londonderry. The Marchioness, still smarting
over the recent demise of her (new) Women’s Legion at the hands –
she was convinced – of the Ministry of Labour, sent a stinging response
to the War Ofﬁce. She complained that the involvement of the ministry
would lead to the break-up of trained units such as her Women’s
Legion motor transport section; that the ‘class of person’ recruited
through labour exchanges would be ‘totally unsuitable’ for the army;

and that it was ‘ridiculous and wasteful’ that organisations intended
for military service should not have a direct connection with the War
Ofﬁce.29 Despite her protests, she was told that the matter could not be
reopened.30

The Auxiliary Territorial Service
Over the winter of 1937–8, the War Ofﬁce began to reconsider its
position in regard to a women’s reserve. By this stage, events in Europe
were becoming increasingly ominous and the army needed to put itself on
a war footing. All possible measures had to be taken to make the most
efﬁcient use of its trained manpower.31 To this end, the Secretary of State
for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha suggested that ‘There is no reason why
women should not be engaged forthwith as part of the Army Reserve,
so that on the outbreak of hostilities they can release individuals, and even
the bulk of certain units, for inclusion in active formations’.32 There was
also a change of personnel on the Army Council. Knox was replaced as
Adjutant-General by Lieutenant-General Sir Clive Liddell, who seemed
more receptive to the need for a national pool of trained women.33
Meanwhile, the well-connected members of the women’s bodies relentlessly lobbied service ofﬁcials to persuade them of the military utility of
their organisations. Gwynne-Vaughan and her supporters were tireless in
seeking opportunities to press the case for the Emergency Service.34 Lady
Jackson, for example, buttonholed Hore-Belisha when he visited her
husband’s command.35 Londonderry and the Countess of Athlone, president of the FANY, were also indefatigable in promoting their respective
enterprises. A beleaguered Hore-Belisha reported that the two women
were ‘always at him about their shows’.36
Against this background, the army authorities revisited the
issue. Not only did it seem invidious on reﬂection to rebuff the women’s
organisations by compelling their well-to-do membership to report to
labour exchanges on the outbreak of war, but it also came to be
recognised that there were practical weaknesses in the Ministry of
Labour scheme. The ministry held no general register of available
women and when demands were suddenly received from the service
departments for a certain category of personnel, it would be dependent
either upon those women who happened to be registered as unemployed
at its labour exchanges, or upon volunteers, to meet the demand. Those
registered as unemployed varied according to boom and slump

conditions in industry and might not be available in sufﬁcient numbers.
And while volunteers would no doubt come forward, they might not
offer their services quickly enough or be of the ‘right class’. It was also
evident that a large number of well-qualiﬁed women were reluctant to
go anywhere near a labour exchange and preferred to deal directly with
the War Ofﬁce.37 Clearly the system had a number of shortcomings.
As a result, Hore-Belisha – who, it might be noted, had recently
joined Londonderry’s weekly social circle, the ‘Ark’, under the animal
pseudonym of ‘Leslie the Lion’38 – concluded that the best course of
action was for the War Ofﬁce to rescind the CID’s decision and form its
own ofﬁcial women’s reserve.39 This would build on the achievements
of the existing women’s organisations and ensure that on mobilisation
the army would have at its disposal a group of enrolled women already
allotted to certain posts, who were fully conversant with the duties they
were to undertake. In the spring of 1938, a letter was despatched to the
CID informing it of the army’s decision.40 The Ministry of Labour
representative on the CID’s subcommittee on the control of manpower,
who had in fact sat on the women’s reserve subcommittee two years
previously, recorded his strong disapproval of the War Ofﬁce’s executive action on this matter, enacted without any consultation with the
relevant authorities. ‘This was’, he protested, ‘a most unusual way of
conducting Government business’.41 But there was little that could be
done to halt what was effectively a fait accompli.
During the early summer, the War Ofﬁce drew up plans for
a women’s reserve in consultation with Gwynne-Vaughan of the
Emergency Service, Londonderry of the Women’s Legion and Mary
Baxter Ellis, commandant of the FANY.42 The Air Ministry and the
Admiralty were also approached with a view to their inclusion in the
scheme. The RAF indicated its desire to participate (with Loch’s
Women’s Legion Flying Section quietly sidelined in the process) but
the Royal Navy decided not to become involved.43 The new organisation, as the Burnett-Hitchcock committee had proposed some twenty
years earlier, was to be afﬁliated to the Territorial Army. The volunteers, who would wear a khaki uniform but remain civilians in the eyes
of the law, were to undertake non-combatant duties as cooks, clerks,
orderlies, storewomen and motor drivers. They were to be organised as
companies on a county basis, under the direction of county commandants. Training evenings would be held in local drill halls and an annual
camp organised. The three recognised women’s bodies were to form the

nucleus, with the Emergency Service serving as an ofﬁcer training unit
and the Women’s Legion and FANY supplying drivers. The scheme
would be administered in the War Ofﬁce by the department of the
Director-General of the Territorial Army (DGTA). The nomenclature
of the enterprise engendered a good deal of discussion. It was originally
titled the Women’s Auxiliary Defence Service but as no one wished to be
known as a ‘WAD’ this was deemed unacceptable. The name was thus
changed to the less offensive Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS).44
In the autumn of 1938, the Munich crisis blew up and war
seemed imminent. As public anxiety grew, large numbers of women
converged on local authority ofﬁces clamouring to undertake some form
of national service and the War Ofﬁce was under increasing pressure to
provide an outlet for their endeavours.45 Moreover, as Viscountess
Trenchard pointed out to Hore-Belisha, who at one time had sought
to appoint her husband as an unofﬁcial adviser in his dealings with the
general staff, if the military authorities did not move quickly to establish
the new organisation, then many of the best qualiﬁed women would
take up other forms of war work.46 In these circumstances, and before
the details of the scheme had even percolated down to many Territorial
Army units across the country, the BBC announced the formation of the
ATS on 27 September.47 A new women’s auxiliary service thus hurriedly
came into being as the anti-aircraft guns were set up on Horse Guards
Parade in anticipation of the impending German onslaught.
The early weeks of the ATS were predictably chaotic. The
Territorial Army adjutants, who were busy embodying their own male
recruits, were often at a loss as to how to deal with the women who
descended on the drill halls wishing to join up.48 Many of the new ATS
ofﬁcers were no wiser about the service. The presidents of the Territorial
Army associations were given the task of appointing the county commandants and tended to approach the local ‘great lady’ to ﬁll this role. The
county commandants, in turn, were required to nominate the junior
ofﬁcers and usually plumped for leisured acquaintances who had the
spare time to devote to the service, but were often woefully ignorant
about their responsibilities.49 This was a cause of frustration to
Emergency Service women who believed that they were much better
qualiﬁed to take on these posts.50 Nevertheless, by the outbreak of war,
17,600 women had been enrolled in the ATS and most of the companies
were nearing full strength.51 Some male units quickly accepted the women
and gave them what assistance they could in matters of military

17 / The Auxiliary Territorial Service
instruction. But many were unconvinced by their sisters in arms. As one
ATS ofﬁcer, Leslie Whateley (who was later to be head of the service),
recalled: ‘The regular soldiers, and even the Territorials, were, for the most
part, really sceptical as to how much use a woman’s army could be to them
in wartime. We heard a number of insinuations that our help would be
a hindrance.’52 The War Ofﬁce admitted that in these early days, ‘the
Army did not then understand or appreciate the employment of women on
a duty which, in peace, had been regarded as essentially a man’s job’.53
It was not until the spring of 1939 that the army authorities gave
serious consideration to the appointment of a female chief for the ATS. Up
to this point it was thought that a relatively junior male staff ofﬁcer in the
DGTA’s department could oversee the service. It became clear, however,
that with the announcement of the doubling of the Territorial Army, the
DGTA’s branch would be fully occupied with the new male intake.
Furthermore, some of the feminine matters with which the hapless
DGTA ofﬁcer had to deal, such as the relative merits of a brassiere and
suspender-belt as opposed to a corset in the ATS pattern uniform, did not
fall within the competence of the average male staff college graduate.54
Indeed, Viscountess Trenchard apparently advised Hore-Belisha that the
organisation would only be successfully managed once a woman was put
in charge.55 As a result, the War Ofﬁce began to look into the possibility of
appointing a female director to administer the service under the DGTA.
Gwynne-Vaughan, who coveted such a role, canvassed county
commandants on the question of a ‘head woman’.56 Her position was
that not only were there many ‘purely feminine questions’ arising out of
a women’s service that needed to be handled by a senior female ﬁgure, but
also that such an organisation, however essential, would inevitably be
a ‘background affair’ and that the War Ofﬁce ought not to divert
a valuable male staff ofﬁcer to running a ‘women’s show’ with which
he would have little understanding or empathy. She was also concerned
that he would not be taken seriously by his peers: ‘other men’, she opined,
‘don’t think very much of a man who is doing a woman’s job, whereas
they are prepared to like and respect women who can do it’.57 One
commandant, Miss Justina Collins, JP, responded that she was opposed
to the appointment of a female head because it would lead to greater selfgovernance for the ATS and undermine its relationship with the
Territorial Army. ‘You will perceive’, she concluded, ‘I am not
a feminist’.58 Gywnne-Vaughan countered that she too would be
opposed to any woman who acted independently of higher authority,

but that it would be ‘a waste’ to use a ﬁrst-class combatant ofﬁcer to run
their organisation: ‘So perhaps’, she countered, ‘I am not a feminist after
all in the usually accepted sense!’59 In the summer of 1939, GwynneVaughan, whose cousin the Earl of Munster had recently joined the War
Ofﬁce as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War, was duly
appointed as the director of the ATS (DATS).60

19 / The Women’s Auxiliary Air Force
The appointment of Gwynne-Vaughan brought to the surface
a simmering dispute with the FANY. This body was drawn from what
Roy Terry has described as the ‘mink and manure set’ and considered
itself the elite women’s organisation. It was determined to retain its
distinctive identity within the ATS and tended to hold itself aloof from
the new women’s service. In particular, it continued to exercise its own
informal style of discipline which involved all ranks messing together
off-duty and countenanced FANY other rank drivers socializing with
male ofﬁcers at the end of the working day. The drivers, for their part,
revelled in their status as ‘gentlewoman rankers’ and regarded ATS
ofﬁcers – whose role they contemptuously dismissed as ‘counting Ats’
knickers and making sure they hadn’t got nits in their hair’ – as little
more than trumped-up social workers. The independent behaviour of
the FANY was anathema to Gwynne-Vaughan, who embodied the
hierarchical disciplinary conventions of the regular army, and on
becoming DATS she was determined to bring it into line with other
parts of her service. This led to a virtual ‘war’ with Baxter Ellis, who
commanded the FANY motor companies and had been opposed to
Gywnne-Vaughan’s appointment, and to a great deal of friction
between her FANYs and ‘interfering’ ATS ofﬁcers. Although it was
inevitable that the big battalions of the ATS would eventually assimilate
the FANY – with the special concession that they could wear a FANY
ﬂash on the shoulder of their ATS uniforms – it was not until the
replacement of Gwynne-Vaughan as DATS in 1941 that relations
between the parties began to improve.61

The Women’s Auxiliary Air Force
As part of the Air Ministry’s participation in the ATS, it was
agreed that separate RAF companies would be formed with their own
distinctive badge. The members of these companies, however, soon
began to clamour for a much closer association with the RAF than
they were able to achieve through their Territorial Army afﬁliation. At
the same time, it became apparent that a shortage of suitable accommodation meant that it was unlikely that the RAF would be able to
absorb large numbers of women in the early months of a war. As
a result, in late 1938 the Air Ministry decided, in consultation with the
War Ofﬁce, that the RAF companies would be linked to local Auxiliary
Air Force units and that they would become ofﬁcer and NCO (Non-

2 8:

commissioned ofﬁcer) producing companies. These companies – which
the RAF authorities would assume responsibility for – would provide
the cadres around which future expansion could take place.62
Despite these modiﬁcations, the ATS scheme remained unsatisfactory from the Air Ministry’s point of view. The RAF companies continued
to be subject to army administrative procedures that differed from those of
their own service. Moreover, the training requirements of the RAF companies, which were now composed of potential ofﬁcers and NCOs, were at
odds with those of the other ATS companies that were to serve with the
army and which catered mainly for other ranks. In these circumstances the
Air Ministry concluded in the spring of 1939 that it had no choice but to
withdraw its RAF companies from the ATS and set up its own independent
women’s auxiliary service. The War Ofﬁce was reconciled to this and on
28 June the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) came into being.63
The WAAF was to be organised on a county basis. The trainee
ofﬁcers and NCOs in its companies were to wear an air force blue uniform and, like the ATS, would retain their legal status as civilians. They
were to undertake mainly administrative training to prepare them to
supervise women in similar trades to those of their former service:
cooks, clerks, orderlies, equipment assistants and motor drivers (fabric
workers being added for companies attached to balloon squadrons). The
Air Member for Personnel was to oversee the service in the Air Ministry
and a female director of the WAAF (DWAAF) was appointed to advise
him. She was Jane Trefusis Forbes, who had served with the Women’s
Volunteer Reserve (a similar body to the FANY and Women’s Legion)
during the First World War; built up a successful dog-breeding business
during the inter-war years, and then acted as one of Gywnne-Vaughan’s
stalwarts in the Emergency Service.64 There were, however, elements
within the RAF who plainly had little time for the new airwomen. Air
Chief Marshal Sir Philip Joubert, a former Inspector General of the RAF,
admitted that ‘a very high percentage of the regular RAF ofﬁcers regarded
them as an unmitigated nuisance and gave them no help’.65
The ﬁrst public appearance of the WAAF came at a parade of all
the national service organisations in Hyde Park, a few days after its
inauguration. One of its NCOs, Felicity Peake, smartly attired in the
new blue uniform, was thrilled at the prospect of representing her
service at this event: ‘My high spirits were soon crushed, however, as
I edged my way to a seat on the bus and one of the passengers asked me
for a ticket!’66

The WAAF had little time to bed in before the outbreak of war,
as most of its companies were closed down for leave during the months
of July and August. This meant that rather than preparing for their
impending mobilisation, the 1,700 women enrolled in the ﬂedgling force
were instead enjoying their summer holidays.67

The Women’s Royal Naval Service
The Admiralty’s view was that the Ministry of Labour would
provide it with womanpower in the event of war and no useful purpose
would be served by establishing a peacetime women’s reserve. However,
it came under increasing pressure to revise its position. During the

autumn of 1937, and again in the spring of 1938, Dame Katharine
Furse, the head of the WRNS during the First World War, wrote
a number of letters to the naval authorities (with similar missives
being sent to the Prime Minister’s private secretary) enquiring about
their policy on the matter. She informed the Admiralty that in view of
the deteriorating international situation, former members of the WRNS
were eager to serve with the Royal Navy and wished to know what steps
were being taken to facilitate this. A series of stalling replies was sent to
Furse, explaining that the question was under review and no plans could
be drawn up at present, but clearly the naval authorities were now in the
ﬁring line on this issue.68
In the spring of 1938, the Admiralty decided not to join the
War Ofﬁce and the Air Ministry in the ATS scheme. It was thought
desirable, however, to ascertain the likely requirements of the Royal
Navy for womanpower in wartime and to prepare the skeleton outline of a women’s organisation. It was also deemed prudent to invite
Dame Katharine to offer her advice on such an enterprise. During
the summer, the naval commanders-in-chief of the home commands
were asked to estimate their requirements for women and, in consultation with Furse, discussions began on the structure of a naval
service. In the wake of the Munich crisis in the autumn, which added
a new sense of urgency, a draft scheme was agreed which established
the framework of such a service and acknowledged that some
women would have to be recruited and trained in peacetime if they
were to be efﬁcient enough to replace naval personnel on the outbreak of war.69
In the meantime, the CID had recommended that a Ministry of
Labour handbook should be issued to the public in which the various
forms of national service would be outlined. Government departments
were invited to contribute relevant sections. The Admiralty drew up
a statement for inclusion in which it was indicated that a limited number
of women would be employed for duties in naval establishments in place
of male ratings and that further particulars would be available from the
Secretary of the Admiralty. The handbook was published early in 1939
and created an avalanche of correspondence in the secretary’s ofﬁce
from women eager to join a naval service. Within a few weeks, some
15,000 applications for further particulars had been received and many
women who applied believed that they had actually enrolled in the
organisation.70

Given these circumstances, the naval authorities decided to take
the plunge and introduce a peacetime women’s auxiliary service. Vera
Laughton Mathews, who had served in the WRNS during the First
World War and played a prominent role in the Sea Ranger movement
in the inter-war years, was appointed as its director. ‘I cannot help
feeling’, Laughton Mathews dryly observed, ‘that knowledge of the
15,000 unanswered letters was a spur in urging very busy men to
action’. ‘What they were looking for’, she believed, ‘was someone on
whom they could dump the whole thing and leave her to get on with
it’.71 The new director obligingly got down to dealing with the vast
backlog of applications and ﬁnalising the details of the organisation. On

14 April the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) – the only women’s
service to revive its First World War title – was announced to the
public.72
The WRNS was to be based around the major home naval
ports. The volunteers (known, as they had been during the previous
war, as Wrens) were to sport a navy blue uniform and, like their sister
services, retain their legal status as civilians. They were to undertake
work as cooks, writers, stewards, motor drivers and communication
workers. Regular drills were to be held at local port depots. The head of
the Civil Establishment branch in the Admiralty was to assume responsibility for the new service and the director of the WRNS (DWRNS) was
to administer it under him.73 Laughton Mathews’s early interactions
with naval colleagues were, however, not always easy. While seeking to
lay down some rudimentary regulations for her new service, she recalled
that ‘More than once I was told that I ﬂouted the opinion of an Admiral
of thirty-ﬁve years’ experience. I hung on, miserable but dogged.’74
The WRNS did not get off to the most auspicious of public
starts. At the national service parade in Hyde Park, the Admiralty,
seemingly oblivious to the existence of its new women’s service, forgot
to include DWRNS among the naval dignitaries to be presented to the
King. While Gwynne-Vaughan and Trefusis Forbes were introduced to
the monarch as the directors of their respective auxiliary forces,
Laughton Mathews was relegated to taking part in the march-past
with her Wrens.75 Nevertheless, despite this oversight, by the outbreak
of war, some 1,000 women had been accepted into the organisation and
some preliminary training had been carried out at the ports.76 The three
women’s services were up and running.

2 ORGANISATION AND RECRUITMENT
The Organisational Framework
On the outbreak of war the peacetime women’s services were
merged into the organisational structures of their male ‘parent’ services
and adapted to meet wartime requirements. In the WAAF, women
served on a ‘mixed sex’ (or ‘component’) basis at RAF stations within
one of the RAF’s functional commands, such as Fighter Command,
Bomber Command, Flying Training Command or Maintenance
Command. The senior ofﬁcer of the service was DWAAF. She was
a member of the Air Ministry staff, under the Air Member for
Personnel, and headed a WAAF directorate within his department.
She had limited executive functions and acted mainly as an advisor on
WAAF matters. At the RAF stations, RAF commanding ofﬁcers had
overall command of the airwomen (or Waafs) but WAAF ofﬁcers were
responsible for their ‘well-being’.1
The WRNS was organised differently. Women were incorporated in ‘self-contained’ female units in one of the Royal Navy’s regional
home commands, such as Portsmouth Command, Plymouth Command,
the Nore Command or Rosyth Command. These WRNS units were
employed in naval establishments located within the commands. The
senior ofﬁcer was DWRNS. She headed a WRNS directorate in the
Admiralty, operating initially under the Head of the Civil
Establishment branch but then in the department of the Director of
Personal Services. She enjoyed extensive executive functions in relation

1::79

to her service. At the naval establishments, the WRNS units came under
the overall authority of naval commanding ofﬁcers but the ‘well-being’
of the ratings (or Wrens) was again maintained by WRNS ofﬁcers.2
The conﬁguration of the ATS also differed. The peacetime
county commandant structure was swept away, with the local ‘great
ladies’ being redeployed to other roles in the service and women mainly
embodied in ‘self-contained’ female units in one of the army’s regional
home commands, such as Southern Command, Eastern Command,
Northern Command and Scottish Command. These ATS units were
attached to army establishments within the commands. Women also
served in ‘mixed sex’ units in the army’s functional Anti-Aircraft (AA)
Command. The senior ofﬁcer of the service was DATS. She worked
originally under the DGTA but was subsequently transferred to the
Adjutant General’s department in the War Ofﬁce where she headed
the ATS directorate. She too enjoyed a good deal of leeway in relation
to the running of her service. Army formation commanders exercised
overall control of the ATS personnel in ‘self-contained’ and ‘mixed sex’
units, but ATS ofﬁcers once again looked after the ‘well-being’ of the
auxiliaries.3
The organisational structures of the women’s services thus varied – the WAAF being more closely assimilated with its ‘parent’ service
than the ATS or the WRNS.4 The RAF hierarchy justiﬁed this close
WAAF-RAF relationship on the grounds of avoiding duplication of staff
work, increased overheads and the uneconomical use of man and
womanpower.5 It also seemed to chime with the RAF’s functionality
as one large single ‘regiment’ and its image as a more modern and less
hidebound ﬁghting force than the other two services.6 But such a fusion
could be a source of friction. Air Chief Marshal Sir Philip Joubert
observed that there were two conﬂicting schools of thought on this
matter that ‘caused a great deal of trouble in the WAAF throughout
the war’. On the one hand, he remarked, there were senior airwomen
who were ‘all in favour of integration with the men from top to bottom’;
but on the other there were those ‘who considered the administration of
the service should be carried out by a hierarchy of females, in the same
manner that the senior men ran the men’s service’.7 In illustration of this
conundrum, the DWAAF, Jane Trefusis Forbes, was eager that the
WAAF should consider itself ‘part and parcel’ of the RAF,8 but also
complained of being sidelined by her male colleagues, saying that she
was ‘dead sick of having my views explained by someone else.’9

Nonetheless, despite these underlying tensions, what underpinned the
administration of all three women’s forces was a conviction on the part
of the armed forces that while ultimate executive control should rest
ﬁrmly with the male service establishment, the special feminine nature
of these enterprises – what the Air Ministry termed the ‘difference of
sex’10 – necessitated that the ‘well-being’ of servicewomen should
remain in the hands of women ofﬁcers. Indeed, all the women’s services
incorporated ‘administrative’ ofﬁcer branches whose chief military
function was to oversee this aspect of their female personnel’s lives.11
These ofﬁcers, who along with their administrative support staff came
to make up some 3 to 4 per cent of the total strength of the women’s
forces, had no counterpart in the male services and were thus regarded
as one of the additional overheads in the deployment of women with the
armed forces.12 Some servicemen dubbed them the women’s
‘nannies’.13

Voluntary Recruitment
In the early period of the war, conscription was not applied to
women. The ATS, WRNS and WAAF were forced to rely on voluntary
recruitment to meet the growing demands on their forces. (The WAAF
had been a pre-war ofﬁcer and NCO producing organisation prior to
the war but began to recruit other ranks on the outbreak of hostilities.)
Under wartime recruiting regulations, single or married women were
eligible to volunteer. The age limits set by the individual services varied
but were generally between the ages of seventeen-and-a-half and fortythree (with parents having to give consent for those under eighteen).
Volunteers reported to a recruiting centre afﬁliated to the service they
wished to join. They completed an application form, were interviewed
by a recruiting ofﬁcer, and given a medical examination. If they met the
entry requirements and were not prohibited from volunteering under
the terms of the schedule of reserved occupations, they were enrolled for
the duration of the war. Those who joined up were liable to serve
anywhere in the United Kingdom, and subsequently overseas if
required, but the WRNS maintained an ‘immobile’ branch which
allowed Wrens to live in their own homes and work in the local naval
establishment.14 In the ATS, enemy aliens (those of enemy nationality
living in Britain) accepted for service were at ﬁrst restricted to domestic
duties in special ‘Allied Volunteer Platoons’, which were akin to the

army’s Pioneer Corps, but were later permitted to serve in almost all
trades.15
Women volunteered for a variety of reasons. These included
a chance to escape an unhappy home life, a desire for companionship,
a yearning for a more stimulating job, a wish to emulate relatives and
friends who had joined the forces, an attempt to enter a favoured service
in advance of conscription, or simply the opportunity to ‘swank around
in a uniform’.16 But patriotism was an important motivating factor.
There was a widespread desire to serve the country in its hour of need, to
do one’s bit for the war effort, and contribute to hitting back at the
enemy.17 For some this became a personal quest for vengeance.
Margaret Hunt decided to join the ATS as she lay among the ruins of
her home after it had received a direct hit during the blitz: ‘They’re not
getting away with that!’, she vowed to herself.18 In 1941 an investigation into public attitudes towards the ATS by the Wartime Social Survey
on behalf of the Ministry of Information, which included interviews
with some 600 ATS volunteers, revealed that half of the reasons put
forward by the auxiliaries for joining up were ‘patriotic in nature’ or

‘allied to patriotism’. By far the most popular ‘patriotic’ explanation
was stated to be ‘Because I thought the country needed my services’.19
There was a service ‘pecking order’ among volunteers. The
WAAF was the preferred choice for many women. Its association with
the heroic exploits of the RAF in the skies over Britain gave it
a particularly glamorous allure.20 The WRNS was also a popular

preference. It was the smallest service and had a reputation for being
highly selective. This endowed it with a distinct social cachet.21 Both
these forces further beneﬁted from what was considered to be
a ﬂattering blue uniform.22 Peggy Erskine-Tulloch admitted to being
swayed by navy blue: ‘I have to admit that my choice of Service was
partly inﬂuenced by the fact that khaki would have done very little for
mousy hair and a sallow complexion.’23 On similar grounds, Iris
Lambert plumped for air force blue: ‘Being a woman, vanity came into
it, so I chose the WAAF because brown didn’t suit me and I suffered
terribly from sea sickness.’24 The ATS was the least favoured option. As
the largest organisation, it was reputed to take the ‘odds and ends’ left
over by the other forces and was generally regarded as the ‘Cinderella’
service.25 The Wartime Social Survey found that of those women willing
to volunteer for the services, half preferred to join the WAAF, one-third
the WRNS and one-ﬁfth the ATS.26
For the parents of young volunteers it was not always easy to see
them leave the nest. Some refused to give their consent and fought
a battle of wills against frustrated teenagers determined to join up.27
In this regard, pre-war concepts of the ‘dutiful daughter’ clashed with
wartime notions of the independent young woman serving the state.28
Others insisted that they sit in during interviews at recruiting ofﬁces to
ensure that the chosen service – like some sort of ﬁnishing school – was
‘suitable’ for their offspring.29All that most could do was hope that their
daughters settled down in the forces and avoided ‘trouble’. Hazel
Williams vividly recalled the day she left home to report for duty with
the WAAF: ‘I shall always remember my Mother, tears streaming down
her face, at the door. Then she called me back and said “Don’t sit on
strange lavatory seats”, and pointing to her bosom, “and don’t let any
man touch you there!”’30
Between September 1939 and December 1945, approximately
487,000 volunteers joined the women’s services (of whom 79,000
served in the WRNS, 186,000 in the WAAF and 222,000 in the
ATS).31 Voluntary recruitment thus accounted for over three-quarters
of the women who entered the wartime forces. This contrasted with the
male services in which volunteers made up a third of the total intake.32
Perhaps the most venerable wartime volunteer was Private Evelyn
Wybergh. A woodcarver and former Welsh international hockey player,
she lied about her age in order to enter the ATS and was later discovered
to be ‘not far off 80’. She was often to be seen delivering messages on her

bicycle to ATS billets around Chester and was reported to have been ‘as
wiry as a whippet and right on top of her job’.33

The Coming of Conscription
Despite the signiﬁcant numbers of women who volunteered,
compulsion was soon on the government’s agenda. By 1941 the competing demands of war industry and the armed forces for limited manpower resources meant that the women’s services needed to expand
rapidly in order to release male personnel for more active duties. Due
to the size of the army the ATS required the greatest intake. It was
estimated by the War Ofﬁce that an additional 100,000 members
needed to be recruited for the service by the end of the year in order to
counteract the restrictions placed on the allocation of men to the army
under the new manpower ceiling set by the government.34 The ATS
volunteering ﬁgures fell far short of expectations.
This was due in part to the unwillingness of women to consider
joining any of the three services. Family commitments prevented many
from coming forward to volunteer, whilst others were loath to give up
a comfortable civilian job for the communalism and regimentation of
service life. Possessive boyfriends, moreover, did not approve of their
girlfriends taking the king’s shilling. If they were civilians they did not
relish strolling out with the equivalent of an able seaman or a leading
aircraftsman on their arm, and if they were in the armed forces they did
not want their sweethearts ‘running the gauntlet’ of hundreds of other
servicemen in camps across the country.35 Something more deep-seated
might have been at play here too. It was speculated that men had been
brought up to believe that war was ‘a purely masculine undertaking’ and
it ‘hurt their pride’ to think of their womenfolk joining in.36 Whatever
the reasoning, one recruit, Marjorie Hazell, admitted that ‘many girls
were threatened with broken romances if they dared to join up’.37 To
compound matters, Jenny Nicholson, a WAAF public relations ofﬁcer,
contended that public perceptions of the women’s forces had been
undermined by ‘spinster politics’:
The newspapers were inclined to make the WRNS, ATS, and
WAAF sound like the worst kind of domestic service administered by uniformed amazons of gross proportions. The Osbert
Lancaster cartoons of this phase of the war were typical. Funny

but vicious was the one showing a large table-legged, monocled
woman in uniform, ticking off a fellow-woman-horror for
mentioning a man’s name in the Mess.38
There was, however, a particular ‘image’ problem with the ATS. Under
the ageing Gwynne-Vaughan, the service was not an enticing prospect
for a young woman. The drab uniform was a handicap. The khaki
colour did not suit the colouring of many women and the cut was
shapeless and unfashionable.39 The spartan living conditions were
a further discouragement. The bureaucratic strains imposed by the
rapid expansion of the service and the shortage of suitable accommodation meant that life in outlying areas could be harsh.40 This was exacerbated by Gwynne-Vaughan’s insistence that women should endure
the same privations as the men. ‘It is the only way,’ she claimed, ‘that
I can prove that women can do anything they are asked to!’41 Above all,
the reputation of the ATS was undermined by allegations of immorality
(as had that of the WAAC during the First World War). Evidently
fuelled by the malicious gossip of soldiers, which was said to have its
roots in ‘male possessiveness’, ‘professional jealousy’ and ‘ancient gossip against the WAACs of the last war’, lurid rumours began to circulate
about the promiscuity of its members.42 As a result, the Wartime Social
Survey reported that ‘the nicer type of girl will not look at the ATS’.43
Parents too began to turn their noses up at the service. Florence
Teasdale’s mother threw her ATS application form on the ﬁre: ‘You’re
not ending up as some ofﬁcer’s groundsheet’, she declared.44
Occasionally this antipathy spilled over into public contempt. Vera
Roberts, who undertook her ATS training in Harrogate, recalled that
‘A lot of people had a real down on women like us in uniform . . . and the
Harrogate ladies gave you a dirty look and just spat in front of you.
They thought we were the lowest of the low.’45
The War Ofﬁce did try to improve the ‘proﬁle’ of the ATS. In the
summer of 1941, the increasingly overbearing Gwynne-Vaughan was
replaced as director by a much younger and more glamorous ofﬁcer:
Jean Knox. The new DATS, who was promoted over the heads of more
senior colleagues, sought to give the service more feminine appeal. The
uniform was redesigned to make it smarter. This involved restyling the
tunic so that it had a tighter waist and padded shoulders. Efforts were
also made to improve the living conditions. These included securing
a more generous scale of accommodation furnishings such as curtains,

bedside mats and divans.46 This emphasis on appearance and comfort
was not welcomed by all ATS ofﬁcers. When Julia Cowper saw a copy of
the Illustrated magazine featuring a striking photograph of the new
director on the front cover, and an article inside on ‘the feminine atmosphere of “ATS Headquarters”’, she believed that this put the female
ofﬁcer’s role ‘on the level of an industrial welfare ofﬁcer’ and took away
‘any suggestion of a responsibility to command’.47 Nevertheless, as
Leslie Whateley, who had been made Knox’s deputy, recalled: ‘When

Jean became Director nothing but the best was good enough for the
ATS.’48 Alongside these initiatives a publicity campaign was launched
to stimulate recruiting. This attempted to combat the ‘whispering campaign’ against the service by providing reassurances about the careful
supervision of ATS personnel and the ‘high standard of conduct’
expected of auxiliaries.49
The Ministry of Labour and National Service also put pressure
on women to join the ATS. In the spring of 1941, a Registration for
Employment Order (REO) was introduced under the Emergency
Powers (Defence) Act. This obliged women in selected age groups to
register at labour exchanges and provide details of their current employment and family responsibilities. If it was deemed that they were available for work of national importance, they could be ‘directed’ into war
industry. Although the ministry did not have the power to ‘direct’
registrants into the women’s services, it sought to ‘persuade’ suitable
candidates to enrol in the ATS. This involved gently indicating to them
that they could be compelled to undertake less congenial work in
a munitions factory if they declined to join up.50
These measures did not boost ATS volunteering to the
required level. By the end of 1941 only 58,000 additional auxiliaries
had been recruited. This shortfall had adverse consequences for the
army’s operational capability. In particular, it seemed likely that
mobile units of the ﬁeld force at home, which formed a vital part of
the defences against a German invasion, might have to be sacriﬁced in
order to ﬁll static roles in Anti-Aircraft Command that could be
undertaken by women.51 Against this backdrop, the conscription of
women into the services came under serious consideration by the
government.
The Minister of Labour and National Service, Ernest Bevin, had
been anxious to avoid such a step because, in the words of the author of
one of the internal government histories of the women’s forces, it ‘cut
across certain widespread conventional attitudes and would undoubtedly cause a public stir’.52 But the disappointing ATS volunteering
ﬁgures (and the possibility that, at a later stage, the WAAF might also
not be able to meet its requirements by volunteers alone) forced his
hand.53 Towards the end of 1941, he proposed to the War Cabinet that
young women should be compelled to undertake military service. Some
of his ministerial colleagues had serious reservations about such
a course of action. It was claimed that not all women were suited to

1::79

35 / The Coming of Conscription
a military lifestyle and that male members of the armed forces would
‘object strongly’ to their womenfolk being forced into uniform.54
Indeed, Churchill stated that ‘he was not at present disposed to favour
any form of conscription for the Women’s Services’.55 Bevin, however,
was not to be defeated. It was explained that all other practical alternatives to compulsion had been investigated and no other method
would sufﬁce. Furthermore, he pointed out that there was ‘a widespread
feeling in the country that the Government should order the younger
women to give their services where they were most needed; and many
women were holding back on the basis that when they were wanted,
they would be fetched’.56 After several weeks of fraught negotiation, the
War Cabinet eventually agreed in principle to conscription and legislation was drawn up for the approval of parliament.57
During the debate in the House of Commons in early December,
a number of MPs expressed their anxieties. Agnes Hardie, Labour MP
for Glasgow Springburn, contended that the waging of war was a ‘man’s
job’ and that ‘women have the bearing and rearing of children and
should be exempt from war’. ‘In spite’, she protested, ‘of the feminist
attitude – and I am as good a feminist as anyone – I say they have no
right to conscript women’.58 George Buchanan, Labour MP for
Glasgow Gorbals, was of a similar mind. ‘I do not accept the view that
women and men are alike’, he asserted. ‘What is good for a man is not
necessarily good for a woman.’ He maintained that ‘women are not ﬁt
subjects to be conscripted into the Armed Forces’ and lamented that, as
a trade unionist, he never ‘thought he would have lived to see the day
when a Labour Minister [Bevin] would have been connected with
a measure in this House for the conscription of women’.59 The majority
of members, however, were prepared to support the government.
Eleanor Rathbone, Independent MP for the Combined English
Universities, who had helped to found the Women’s Volunteer
Reserve during the First World War,60 regarded the measure as
a gratifying opportunity for her female compatriots to serve their
nation: ‘I believe’, she opined, ‘that these proposals will be warmly
welcomed by the women of the country.’61 Mavis Tate, Conservative
MP for Frome, reasoned that there was no alternative: ‘I believe that we
are up against such appalling odds that it is idle to maintain that women
can keep out of the war.’62 Henry Brooke, Conservative MP for West
Lewisham, agreed: ‘We all somewhat dislike the idea of conscription for
women into the uniformed services, but it is proved essential.’63 On

11 December 1941, the legislation was approved and for the ﬁrst time in
British history, women became subject to compulsory military service.64
One wartime commentator, Margaret Goldsmith, wondered ‘whether
in times of peace women will now be willing to accept anything but
absolute equality with men’.65
Under the National Service (No. 2) Act, women in Great Britain
between the ages of twenty and thirty were made liable for the military
call-up. They were to enjoy the same statutory protection as their male
counterparts in relation to postponement on the grounds of exceptional
hardship or conscientious objection and as regards their reinstatement
in civilian employment on discharge from the forces. But several ‘safeguards’ were incorporated in the act’s statutes and administrative regulations that differentiated the conscription of women from that of the
men. First, married women not living apart from their husbands, or
those who had living with them a child of their own under the age of
fourteen, were to be exempt from any obligation to serve. Second, those
who were eligible to be called-up would have the right to opt for a job in
war industry or civil defence if they did not wish to join one of the
women’s services. And third, no woman would be asked to participate
in duties involving the use of lethal weapons (such as helping to operate
anti-aircraft guns) unless she signiﬁed in writing her willingness to do so.
The application of conscription was thus limited in the case of women.66
The national service machinery required women of the proclaimed age classes to register at labour exchanges, if they had not
already done so under the REO. They then completed form ‘NS 196’,
indicating what type of war work they wished to undertake. Those who
opted for the women’s services were allowed to express a preference for
a particular force, but in order to ensure that the ATS (and in time the
WAAF) got the necessary recruits, it was made clear that women would
be allocated according to ‘the needs of the services’.67 To help facilitate
this process, special entry requirements were laid down for the WRNS
(which had a long waiting list for voluntary applicants). These were
designed to ensure that a large proportion of optants would be ineligible
for the Wrens and included proﬁciency in German, practical experience
of working with boats, or a family connection with the Royal or
Merchant Navy.68 Intakes destined for the women’s forces were summoned to a medical examination and interviewed by a service recruiting
ofﬁcer. If they met the basic admission standards, and were not already
employed on essential war work or judged to be of ‘doubtful character’,

such as convicted prostitutes, they were posted by the Ministry of
Labour and National Service to an individual service in accordance
with the womanpower priorities at the time. Those called-up were liable
to serve anywhere at home, and later abroad if necessary. In the spring
of 1942, the ﬁrst conscripts reported for duty.69
As it turned out, the military conscription of women was to be
a relatively short-lived phenomenon. The call-up of new age classes was
suspended from early in 1944, as it was thought that volunteers could
provide the required intakes in the ﬁnal stages of the war.70
Nevertheless, during the conﬂict, some 125,000 national service personnel were conscripted into the women’s forces (17,600 serving in the
WRNS, 33,800 in the WAAF and 73,600 in the ATS).71 Conscripts – or
‘army-class’ recruits as the Ministry of Labour and National Service
preferred to term them, because the choice given to women to undertake
civilian war work, rather than military service, was thought to make
those who opted for the latter ‘tantamount to volunteers’72 – thus made
up less than a quarter of the women who joined the wartime services.
The share of conscripts in the total male service intake was two-thirds.73
Although proportionally few in number, women conscripted into the
forces were regarded by some of the early members as a threat to the
esprit de corps of their organisations. Jane Macbeth grumbled about the
‘bolshie tendencies’ of the girls called up for the ATS: ‘Now recruits
were inclined to demand their rights and did not give all to their country
as their duty.’ For her, conscription ‘gave a blow to the old spirit of
volunteering’.74 Agnes Anderson commented on similar attitudes in the
WAAF: ‘There was not the same spirit amongst them as we all had, and
they used to say to me that they couldn’t think how I had stayed in the
service all this time.’75 As Ilana Bet-El has shown, male conscripts
during the Great War were regarded in a similarly negative light.76
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Information sponsored a ﬁlm to
help improve the image of the ATS and boost recruitment. The Gentle
Sex, which ﬁrst appeared in cinemas in the spring of 1943, was written
by a young female screenwriter, Moie Charles and directed by Leslie
Howard. Filmed at Stoughton barracks in Guildford and featuring real
auxiliaries as walk-ons alongside the actresses, it told the story of seven
ATS recruits from diverse backgrounds, such as ‘Gwen’ the cockney
waitress, ‘Anne’ the army ofﬁcer’s daughter, ‘Erna’ the Czech refugee,
and ‘Betty’ the closeted only child, as they proceeded through basic
training and onto service in the ATS.77 It was intended, in the words

1::79

of Howard, to demonstrate ‘the signiﬁcance of their work’ and ‘the
magniﬁcent way in which they are doing their duty’.78 Although the
ATS hierarchy was concerned that some of the scenes of auxiliaries
under ﬁre during a bombing raid ‘were not likely to encourage parents
to let their daughters join up’,79 the ﬁlm did well at the box ofﬁce and
was praised by reviewers. One male critic declared that ‘Whenever I pass
any member of the ATS in the future I shall feel inclined to raise my hat
respectfully . . . They perform a hundred tasks which would have astonished their grandmothers.’80 Jenny Nicholson was also impressed.
Although she claimed that none of the actresses suffered the indignities
of actual recruits in that they were driven each day from their hotel to
the barracks, she nonetheless described it as ‘the ﬁrst truthful and
affectionate account of any women’s service’: ‘There was a sturdy tenderness – a health without heartiness – about it which was delightful.’81
Yet, as Lucy Noakes reminds us, while the ﬁlm portrayed the new
wartime opportunities for women in the ATS, the omniscient closing
speech narrated by Howard reasserted ‘masculine superiority and
power over the female characters’:82
‘Well, there they are, the women. Our sweethearts, sisters,
mothers, daughters. Let’s give in at last and admit that we’re
really proud of you. You strange, wonderful, incalculable creatures. The world you’re helping to shape is going to be a better
world because you’re helping to shape it. Pray silence gentlemen. I give you a toast. The gentle sex!’83

The Markham Report
In order to ease the passage of conscription through parliament,
Bevin promised anxious MPs, several of whom had voiced concerns
about poor living conditions in the ATS, that a review would be undertaken of the standard of amenities in the women’s services.84 At the end
of 1941, he proposed to the military authorities that an interdepartmental committee should investigate the issue. In addition, he
suggested that a permanent advisory committee of women should be
constituted to guide the service departments over welfare matters. This
body would reassure the parents of those called-up and act as an
‘invaluable buffer’ between the ministries and parliament.85 Whilst the
opportunity for interdepartmental consultation was welcomed by the

1::79

39 / The Markham Report
service chiefs, there was some hostility to the creation of a women’s
advisory committee.86 Sir Archibald Sinclair, the Secretary of State for
Air, responded that he did not wish to share responsibility for the
welfare of the WAAF with such a forum and that his own women
ofﬁcers were capable of giving him better advice than ‘a peripatetic
committee of ladies who cannot possess the same knowledge of the
conditions in the Services’.87 In the light of these objections, Bevin
dropped the idea of a women’s body but, early in 1942, an interdepartmental committee was set up to look into the question of amenities. This was to be composed of the three male parliamentary secretaries of the service ministries, together with their counterpart from the
Ministry of Labour and National Service and chaired by the Admiralty
representative: Sir Victor Warrender.88
Concurrently, women’s groups began to lobby the government
on the matter. The National Council of Women of Great Britain and the
Woman Power Committee (the latter being an unofﬁcial group of
female MPs and TUC representatives concerned with women’s war
work) called for an external investigation into the welfare of
servicewomen.89 Irene Ward, Conservative MP for Wallsend-on-Tyne
and chairman of the WPC, informed the Lord President of the Council,
Sir John Anderson, that ‘an internal inquiry by the Departments will be
regarded on all sides as prejudiced’. She contended that an ‘independent
inquiry by women whose names carry weight with the public is the only
way of allaying public anxiety’.90 Despite these representations, the
Deputy Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, who was standing in for
Churchill at the despatch box, went ahead and announced the formation of the Warrender committee to the House of Commons. His statement did not go down well with the MPs present. Not only did this
departmental body reek of a ‘whitewash’ but its all-male composition
offended feminist sensibilities. ‘Does my right hon. Friend think it
would be a good thing’, enquired Thelma Cazalet-Keir, National
Conservative MP for East Islington and a member of the WPC, ‘to set
up an all-women committee to inquire into conditions in the male
Services?’91 Outside the house, there was a similarly censorious reaction
from interested parties. Attlee received a wave of disapproving letters
from such organisations as the National Women Citizens’ Association,
the London and National Society for Women’s Service, St Joan’s Social
and Political Alliance, and Hampstead Garden Suburb Women’s Liberal
Association.92

By this stage, Churchill had begun to see the vulnerability of
the government’s position – ‘It seemed to me rather odd that the
[Warrender] Cte should consist entirely of men’, he scrawled on
a brieﬁng document93 – and asked Attlee to meet, on his behalf,
a deputation of MPs led by Cazalet-Keir.94 Having listened to their
concerns, and consulted the service ministers, the Deputy Prime
Minister recommended that the departmental committee should be
superseded by an entirely different body. This would be an independent committee headed by a woman chairman and incorporating
a majority of female members.95 Although Sinclair was said ‘to remain
unconvinced of the advantage of setting up a [new] Committee’,96 the
Prime Minister agreed to its formation.97 It started work in the spring
of 1942.
The committee was chaired by Violet Markham,
a prominent public servant who had taken part in a similar inquiry
into the WAAC during the previous war, and included CazaletKeir; Dr Edith Summerskill, the Labour MP for West Fulham;
Mary Stocks, principal of Westﬁeld College, University of
London; and Katharine Elliot, chairman of the National
Association of Mixed Clubs and Girls’ Clubs.98 Its remit was to
report on ‘amenities and welfare conditions’ in the three women’s
services. The committee met on thirty-four occasions to consider
evidence submitted by the ministries concerned, as well as outside
bodies, and visited 123 military camps and stations across the
country. Hundreds of letters were also received from concerned
parents about the ordeals of their daughters in uniform. These
ranged from complaints about the lack of gumboots at muddy
camps to accusations that tight-ﬁtting military tunics made
women’s breasts ‘deformed and pendulous’.99
In the late summer of 1942, the Markham committee published
its report. Much of the ﬁndings were concerned with matters affecting
the living conditions for servicewomen. It was admitted that during the
early period of the war there had been justiﬁable grounds for complaint
and examples were cited of such problems as inadequate
accommodation.100 But the report noted that great efforts had been
made to improve the quality of life for female personnel and accommodation now reached ‘a reasonable, and sometimes a high, standard’.101
The committee was keen to stress that gender differences were important in this respect: ‘the auxiliaries of to-day are the wives and mothers

of the future . . . [and] no one desires to apply a wholesale hardening
process to the young women who are serving their country’.102
The section of the report that grabbed most of the attention,
however, was that which addressed the salacious issue of ‘service life
and morals’.103 During the course of its inquiry, the committee took the
opportunity to investigate the rumours of immorality that had plagued
the ATS – which had also begun to sully the reputation of the other
women’s forces.104 Summerskill was sceptical about how reliable their
ﬁndings would be in this regard: ‘I never quite understood how, by
paying a visit to an ofﬁcers’ mess at lunch-time and making a cursory
tour of a camp one bright summer day, one could discover anything

adverse about the sex life of the girls.’105 Nevertheless, while the report
recognised that ‘standards of sexual behaviour’ had changed greatly
during the previous generation and that some recruits would bring
‘loose habits’ acquired in civilian life into the military fold, it was
asserted that ‘promiscuous conduct in the Women’s Services is conﬁned
to a small proportion of the whole’ – a pattern of behaviour seemingly
conﬁrmed by the calculation that the pregnancy rate among unmarried
servicewomen was lower than the illegitimate birth rate among the
comparable female civilian population. As a consequence, it was contended that ‘a vast superstructure of slander has been raised on a small
foundation in fact’. This was put down in part to the aphorism that
‘virtue has no gossip value’, but also to a deep-rooted suspicion of the
military profession among the British public, which meant that ‘a
woman in uniform may rouse a special sense of hostility, conscious
and sub-conscious, among certain people who would never give two
thoughts to her conduct as a private citizen’.106 The committee concluded that the reports of scandalous behaviour were thus largely the
stuff of fantasy:
We can ﬁnd no justiﬁcation for the vague but sweeping charges
of immorality which have disturbed public opinion . . . these
allegations reﬂect most unfairly as a generalisation on a body of
women, the vast majority of whom are serving their country in
a high and self-respecting spirit.107
The military authorities were understandably pleased with the report.
A statement drawn up for the press declared that the women’s services
had been ‘vindicated’ and had ‘every reason to feel satisﬁed’.108 Leslie
Whateley recorded that the ‘whispering campaign’ against the ATS was
largely killed as a result of the inquiry and members of her service could
‘now hold their heads high as they went about their work’.109 The
decision of Princess Elizabeth to join the ATS – quite a coup given the
royal family’s naval connections – seemed to indicate that conﬁdence in
the service had been restored.110

3 TRAINING AND SELECTION
Training
New recruits to the women’s services were posted in the ﬁrst
instance to female basic training centres or depots. The period they
spent at these establishments varied over the war years but eventually
came to be three weeks for those in the WRNS, four weeks for those in
the WAAF and ﬁve weeks for those in the ATS.1 In the WRNS, volunteers were regarded as ‘probationers’ for the ﬁrst two weeks of their
military careers. This meant they could pack up and leave their training
depot at any time during the ﬁrst fortnight if they decided that life in the
Wrens was not for them.2
WAAF ofﬁcer Constance Woodhead described the colourful
scenes at her service’s training centres when batches of new recruits
reported for duty:
It was interesting to watch the daily arrivals at the recruits’
centres; to see the raw material coming in. Women in neat
country suits and sensible shoes; girls in shabby frocks, growing
too small for them; others in their best ﬁnery, dripping with fox
furs and pearls and teetering on high-heeled slippers; fancy hats

already quivering with dislike at the herding together; all terribly anxious to do the right thing in this strange new world . . .
Sometimes mother or auntie came too, just to make sure that
everything was all right; once two small infants were brought
along by a would-be recruit in the touching faith that a grateful
country would take care of them whilst mother cooked for the
RAF. Once or twice an indignant husband turned up in an
attempt to claim a wife who had slipped off without his knowledge to join the WAAF.3
One of the ﬁrst experiences for recruits of this ‘strange new world’ was
an assignment to sleeping quarters. The starkness of a barrack could
come as quite a surprise to those who were accustomed to more comfortable surroundings. Roxane Houston of the WRNS compared her
quarters to those of a nineteenth-century workhouse: ‘Narrow little iron
beds with only a narrow strip of dingy carpeting and a narrow locker
dividing each from its neighbour. Everything narrow, meagre, impersonal, small worlds of isolation.’4 The issuing of clothing, personal equipment and ‘necessaries’ was another rite of passage. In the ATS, for
example, this included such items as steel helmet, ground sheet, respirator, eating irons, enamel mug, identity discs, mending kit, hair brush,
greatcoat, peaked cap, skirt and jacket, shirt and tie, brassiere, corset,
rayon knickers, lisle stockings, lace-up shoes, and – as a special concession to women – winceyette pyjamas.5 Some of these garments were
looked upon with disbelief by those of a fashion-conscious disposition.
Winifred Lane recounted that ‘the famous khaki knickers, of silkyfeeling rayon with elastic at the legs as well as the waist, were greeted
with incredulous laughter’.6 Others were less amused by their new
apparel. ‘I’ll never forget the loathing of seeing my legs clad in khaki
lisle stockings’, groaned Iris Bryce. ‘I felt like my Gran.’7 A medical
inspection was a further initiation. This often involved women stripping
off, forming up like a chorus line and being poked and prodded by
a medical ofﬁcer looking for hidden ailments and conditions (‘bugs,
scabies and babies’ quipped one WAAF examinee8). For the more
bashful recruits, this proved to be something of an ordeal. ‘We were
very modest in those days’, recalled Shirley Aston of the ATS. ‘Having to
parade naked appalled us.’9 An introductory pep talk was an additional
formality. Eileen Smith and her fellow WAAF recruits were assembled
in a hangar and addressed by their female commanding ofﬁcer: ‘She told

us what was expected of us, how to behave, how to dress and then
proceeded to tell us that there were American soldiers in the village
nearby, saying “Now gals, I want no necking down the lane.”’10
During their initial training, female personnel underwent
a programme of rudimentary military instruction designed to assimilate
them into the forces. The syllabi came to resemble that of their male
counterparts, with an emphasis on ‘spit and polish’, drill, route
marches, PT (physical training) and lectures on service procedures.
Women were not, however, expected to undertake weapons’
training.11 Much of the instruction was carried out by the female staff,
but male NCOs took part in the conduct of drill.12 Eileen McMurdo of
the ATS indicated that these servicemen found the task of drilling
women exasperating at times:
Our initiation into the complexities of squad drill were [sic]
conducted by the Regimental Sergeant Major who was ‘on loan’
from one of the regiments of Guards. He was not the gentlest of

creatures on the parade ground but then he had a tougher job
than most sergeant majors. It must have required nerves of steel
and the patience of a saint to teach us ‘rookies’ the basic difference between a right and a left turn to say nothing of coping
with the odd female who, after a half an hour or so of trying to
master the fundamentals of moving to the right in threes, would
dissolve into tears declaring that she’d never been shouted at
like that in her whole life and who did the RSM think he was
anyway?!13
Yet they also derived a certain satisfaction when ‘their’ recruits reached
the required standard. Pat Sparks of the WAAF reminisced that her
regular ﬂight sergeant could not conceal his delight when his trainees
mastered their drill movements: ‘E Squadron,’ he proudly exclaimed,
‘you’re marvellous!’14
For many women, their basic training proved to be a considerable
culture shock. A number were bewildered by the military timetable. Hilda
Mason confessed to being so confused during her ﬁrst few days in the ATS
that she never knew where she should be or what she should be doing at
any given time. She thus ‘paraded with whichever section was nearest’.15
Some were disconcerted by the depersonalisation of the training regime.
‘Like prisoners hearing the gate shut and the key turned,’ reﬂected Muriel
Gane Pushman on her induction into the WAAF, ‘we were locked into
a system where we were numbers and did as we were told; our human
likes, dislikes, fads, or even temperaments were not a matter for
consideration.’16 Others were ﬂummoxed by service terminology.
Houston found the naval lexicon of the WRNS – in which a ﬂoor was
a ‘deck’, a wall was a ‘bulkhead’, a dining room was a ‘mess’ and a trip out
of camp in a ten-ton lorry was ‘going ashore’ on a ‘liberty boat’ – to be
mystifying: ‘I began to feel I was living in a sort of looking-glass world, and
wondered if I’d ever ﬁt in.’17 A few were picked on if they were perceived
to display airs and graces. Mary Lee Settle, an American WAAF volunteer,
was thrown into a puddle of mud by spiteful airwomen in her hut: ‘That’ll
teach the fuckin’ toffy nose’, the ringleader proclaimed.18 A handful soon
fell foul of military regulations. Bryce, still reeling from the frumpiness of
her ATS wardrobe, was placed on a charge of misappropriating the King’s
uniform after her ﬁrst kit inspection:
We’d been shown how to lay out the kit, everything folded in
a certain way and placed strategically on top of your bed, and

we standing to attention by the side of the bed. Sgt. [Sergeant]
Watson slowly walked from bed to bed, followed by Cpl.
[Corporal] Lacey. A brief nod if all was well, or a shake of the
head and the offending garment wrenched up and thrust against
the trembling khaki clad individual who had dared to place
a shirt too near the pyjamas. My turn next. She stopped, looked
at the bed, her eyebrows disappeared beneath her cap peak, she
swivelled round on me, then eyes widened as she looked at the
bed once more. The Cpl. was trembling now, but I just stood,
puzzled. What was wrong? I’d watched my neighbours and oh
so carefully folded and placed everything in the right order.
‘Where’s the rest of it?’ Sgt’s voice thundered the length of the
hut. Heads turned to look at me, then quickly straightened front
as Cpl. glared up and down. I looked at my kit and realised what
she meant. I smiled and sighed in relief ‘Oh, you mean the bras
and corsets, I couldn’t wear those, especially the corsets, all
those bones. No, I’ve got my own roll-ons. I’ve sent the others
to my Gran for her jumble sale.’
Sgt’s face turned pink, then sweat glistened around her nose
and her eyes bulged, she seemed to choke, but managed to blurt
out to the Cpl. ‘Put her on a charge NOW.’ She resumed the rest
of the inspection and I was marched out of the hut to sit and
wait my fate [conﬁned to barracks for forty-eight hours].19
Inevitably, there was a good deal of heartache among new recruits.
Gabrielle Reilly discovered that soon after arriving at her WAAF training camp ‘all the glamour of joining up and doing one’s bit had well and
truly vanished. One was just left with a painful feeling in the pit of one’s
stomach and a sense of loneliness.’20 Vee Robinson found her early
weeks in the ATS equally trying: ‘There were mufﬂed sobs sometimes
after Lights Out and I have to admit that some were mine.’21 The
conscripts were said to have found it particularly difﬁcult to adjust.
Joan Cowey recorded that ‘the girls [in the ATS] who were drafted had
a hard time accepting it. I remember girls getting really hysterical in the
barrack rooms – they couldn’t cope.’22 Some unfortunate women
became so traumatised that they broke down completely and were
quietly removed from the new intakes. Bryce wrote of one such case:
Poor little Marian touched all our hearts. An only child from ‘a
nice part of Neasden’ she’d worked as a ﬁling clerk in a local

printers ‘only at the end of the High Street, Mum was pleased as
I could still go home for dinner’. After a life of gentle coddling she
now found herself being shouted out, wearing uncomfortable ill
ﬁtting clothes, getting soaking wet doing PE on the barrack
square and no Mum . . . By the end of the third week as we all
groped our way out of the Gas Hut [after being exposed to gas as
part of anti-gas training] she just broke down and cried and cried
and cried. No one could stop her. Cpl. slapped her face, then we
laid her on her bed, and ﬁnally she saw the MO [medical ofﬁcer]
and went into Sick Quarters. A week later her kit was collected
and we never saw her again. I sat on my bed that night and felt an
ache deep inside me – oh lucky, lucky Marian. How I wished
I could be back in civvy street again.23
In order to ease their transition into the WAAF, Jane Trefusis Forbes
concluded that female intakes to her service needed to be managed with
greater sensitivity than their male counterparts if they were to be prepared for the rigours of service life:
Although in broad principle there is no reason to treat women
substantially differently to men, it appears that owing to the

greater difference between normal civilian life and Service life in
the case of a woman compared with man, there occurs a slightly
greater shock and change to a woman coming into the Service.
For these reasons it is important that recruits should be
handled with every possible care and consideration.24
Yet despite any initial anguish, most ‘rookies’ gradually adjusted to
their new surroundings. Pushman observed that she and her fellow
recruits found themselves ‘accepting orders and rules, at ﬁrst in a spirit
of resignation, then with growing enthusiasm, and ﬁnally with
a determination to match ourselves individually and collectively to the
challenge’.25 In similar terms, Bryce recognised that by the time
the ‘“square bashing” was almost over I realised that I had accepted
the, to me, artiﬁcial, unnatural programme of my new life’.26 At the end
of her training, McMurdo ‘felt that I could have accepted any challenge
to ﬁght the entire Nazi horde unaided, and, if necessary, to the death’.27
Augmenting these tendencies was a growing afﬁnity with their
male ‘parent’ services. For Angela Mack of the WRNS, such a bond was
sealed by a lecture given to the trainee Wrens by a ‘ﬁerce’ naval ofﬁcer:
He made it very clear that it was our duty to defend our country
to the nth degree, if necessary to our last breath. We were
exhorted to give one hundred and twenty per cent of our best
every moment of every day to live up to the great tradition of the
Royal Navy. Much was made of the fact that we would be part
of the Navy and not an auxiliary service as were the ATS and
WAAF. Whatever happened we must not let the Navy down
which had so generously – perhaps this particular ofﬁcer
secretly considered unwisely – allowed women to share their
duties and responsibilities. Although I appreciated his unspoken
reservation, it did not detract from the patriotic fervour all these
talks had brought out in us. It was the ‘England Expects . . . ’
message and, I imagine, as one woman, we all gave our hearts to
the Royal Navy from that moment.28
Joan Wyndham’s heart was captured more fancifully. She reported that
the ‘grand ﬁnale’ of her WAAF basic training was a talk on ‘esprit de
corps’: ‘We rather liked this one. The main theme seemed to be keeping
the pilots happy and off the booze, giving them a home atmosphere and
so on. We all felt we could do this rather well.’29

In any event, Rebecca Barnett discovered that before long, in
true RAF style, she and the other WAAF recruits ‘shouted “wakeywakey!” in the mornings, talked of a “pukka lot” or of things being
a “wizard prang” and everybody was simply a “bod”’.30 Likewise,
Mary Lee Settle related that on a ﬁrst excursion from their initial
training unit into nearby Hereford, the trainee Waafs ‘called out the
Forces’ insult they had just learned, to civilians, out of the bus windows,
“Ah, you dirty civvie, get some in!” – the “some” being time in the
service, of which they had had about three weeks’.31
Once women had completed their basic training, those who
required further instruction for the roles they were to perform in their

1::79

service were transferred to more specialist training units. The length of
the courses varied from two weeks for less skilled jobs, such as an ATS
mess orderly, to six months for the more complex duties women came to
undertake, such as a WAAF ﬂight mechanic.32 A good deal of this
training came to be conducted at the male ‘parent’ service’s technical
training schools and the pattern of instruction generally conformed to
that of the servicemen. A number of the courses, however, had to be
lengthened because of a perceived lack of scientiﬁc knowledge on the
part of female recruits.33 It was found, for example, that it took at least
a month longer to train a WAAF electrician than her RAF equivalent.
‘Few women, unless they had taken a course on electricity in the home,’
it was observed, ‘had a clear idea of a volt or an amp.’34 The advent of
mixed-sex trade training did arouse some hostility in male service
circles. There was, for instance, some resistance in the RAF towards
airwomen being taught alongside airmen. But, according to the Air
Ministry, ‘this opposition gradually died down as the success of cooperative training was proved’.35 Meanwhile, when Dorothy Calvert of
the ATS discovered that most of the instructors at her radar training
course were male, she was delighted: ‘That was a plus for a start, for if
I had got to learn anything, I would rather it was a man doing the
teaching, as I always found women bitchy, or they were with me.’36
For those earmarked as potential ofﬁcers, female ofﬁcer cadet
training units were established. The time they spent at these institutions
ﬂuctuated during the conﬂict, with the duration of the basic syllabi
ﬁnally settling at four weeks for those in the WRNS and eight weeks
for those in the WAAF and ATS.37 The curricula mirrored those of their
male equivalents, with instruction in such matters as service administration, military law, the conduct of ceremonial parades and ‘womanmanagement’, but the trainees did not study battle tactics.38 Jenny
Nicholson provided a ﬂavour of her WAAF ofﬁcer cadet lectures:
Shufﬂe into separate huts . . . Just like school. 60 desks.

Implicit in their training was an expectation that ﬂedgling ofﬁcers
should learn to conduct themselves as ‘gentlewomen’. During her
WRNS ofﬁcer cadet course, Ann Tomlinson believed that she and her
fellow trainees were closely monitored at mealtimes for signs of uncouth
behaviour:
I remember sitting at one of those long tables, being very much
aware of the high table which was raised on steps at the far end
of the room under this magniﬁcent arch, where the senior
members of staff of the [Royal Naval] College sat, and we all
knew – how we knew, I do not know, but we did know, all of

us – that we were being watched throughout every meal, and
that our manners were being taken note of. The way we conversed with people and the way we behaved ourselves, our
whole demeanour was being watched and noted. And we
would say to each other, ‘Now that is not becoming to an ofﬁcer
and a gentlewoman’.40
At Barbara Littlejohn’s ATS ofﬁcer training unit, the cadets were
required to attend a ‘sort of social hour’ with their instructors and
engage with them in ‘cocktail chit-chat’. As one of the youngest trainees,
and unaccustomed to small talk, she found this ‘one of the most difﬁcult
things that we had to do at OCTU’.41
Some women regarded their ofﬁcer training as akin to life in
a rather claustrophobic girls’ boarding school. ‘The whole thing was so
strained’, complained Josephine Peyman of the ATS. ‘A mass of females
all living under the shadow of dismissal, all trying to outshine each
other, all trying to talk louder and so draw attention to themselves.’42

Yet most managed to survive the ordeal and assume their new ofﬁcer
status within units. A few felt uncomfortable initially in the more
rareﬁed surroundings. Daphne Coyne recalled that
At dinner on my ﬁrst evening at the Wren ofﬁcers’ quarters [in
Newcastle] I’d had a very perfunctory welcome from the other
ofﬁcers and it had gone on from there. I had been depressed to
see that I was the only young one at the table. To my twenty-one
years, almost all the others were in their thirties and forties and
unmarried. Here was a hot bed of bitchiness, jealousy and
knitting patterns. I had landed among some very embittered
women and they made it clear that I was not welcome.43
Others relished their enhanced military status. Joan Wyndham found
her new life as a WAAF ofﬁcer to be ‘absolutely the cat’s whiskers’:
I nearly died of shock when I ﬁrst walked into the Mess [at RAF
Bentley Priory, the headquarters of Fighter Command] – all
chintz sofas and blazing log ﬁres – and a suave blonde walked
up to me and said, ‘Hello, Wyndham, how about a gin and
lime?’ The food is wonderful and booze ﬂows in abundance.
Our private sitting-room is called the ante-room, large and
sunny with a piano and a radiogram.
All my fellow ofﬁcers are fairly glamorous and a gay, wild lot,
always talking about the Savoy or the Berkeley, and the nightclubs they’ve been to. They are mad about swing and play hot
jazz all day.
The Wrens, who share our Mess, are sniffy and stuffy, reading good books in one corner of the ante-room while the
WAAFs go trucking madly around the gramophone singing
‘Bounce Me Brother with a Solid Four’.
. . . I feel I am living in some wonderful dream.44
Training courses were also organised for commissioned ofﬁcers.45
These were generally designed to update and improve their administrative knowledge. At the ATS junior ofﬁcers’ school, which ran a fourweek programme along these lines, the women were appraised on their
performance and, in conformity with standard army practice, were
shown any adverse comments in their course reports. The school assessment procedure had to be reviewed, however, after it was found that it
upset the students. In contrast to male ofﬁcers, many of whom regarded

a disparaging report – ‘a stinker’ – as almost a badge of honour, female
ofﬁcers who were criticised apparently returned to their units ‘in a very
depressed state’ and, as a result of spreading ‘alarming reports’ about
the school, created a wave of ‘hysteria’ among other ofﬁcers ordered to
attend the course, which in turn inhibited their ability to beneﬁt from
it.46 According to Leslie Whateley, this episode demonstrated to the
ATS authorities that they had to take careful account of the ‘peculiar
psychology of women’.47

Selection
During the early period of the war, a woman was usually earmarked for a particular employment within her service on the basis of
a brief interview with an ofﬁcer at a recruiting centre or basic training
centre, who sought to ascertain a recruit’s qualiﬁcations and
preferences.48 This rather arbitrary method, however, began to prove
problematic as the range of trades open to women expanded – many of
which did not have a civilian equivalent – and conscription brought
recruits from a wider variety of educational, occupational and social
backgrounds into the forces.49 Chief Commander Edith Mercer,
a psychologist who acted as the technical advisor on personnel selection
matters in the ATS, summed up the challenge:
Clearly, if efﬁcient use was to be made of the human material
available, a selection problem of considerable magnitude
existed and one which involved not only accurate information
of the existing attainments and experience of these recruits but
also an assessment of their potentialities for training on new
lines.50
To remedy this, in 1942, the ATS instituted a more ‘scientiﬁc’ selection
system that utilised psychological tests to help allocate auxiliaries to
speciﬁc jobs.51 The WAAF and WRNS also adopted such tests to varying degrees in order to assist in the selection of its personnel.52
The new selection system developed in the ATS ran on parallel
lines to that in operation in the army.53 At recruiting centres, women
were required to complete the Progressive Matrices test of general
intelligence. This was designed to screen out those whose low scores
indicated that they were unlikely to perform any useful military function. Some 6 per cent of candidates fell into this category and were not

1::79

admitted to the service.54 Those who proceeded to basic training then
completed a further battery of aptitude tests. This included a clerical
instructions test, a spelling test, an arithmetic test, a spatial awareness
test and a mechanical comprehension test.55 These tests were broadly
the same as those taken by male soldiers, but some modiﬁcations were
made for auxiliaries.56 The arithmetic test, for example, was thought to
be too difﬁcult for women – ‘the average female adult’, contended
wartime service psychologist Philip Vernon, ‘cannot even manage decimals’ – and a simpler version was substituted.57 The mechanical comprehension test was also adapted so that the questions were, in the
words of Vernon, based on ‘cooking, clothes, motor cars and other
things of which women might be expected to have had experience’.58
After completing the tests, recruits were interviewed by
a specially trained female personnel selection ofﬁcer (PSO) who assessed
a woman’s educational attainment, civilian experience, physical characteristics and personal interests. The PSO then recommended a recruit
for suitable employment within the service. In making this judgement,
she took into account the test scores and other selection criteria laid
down for each trade in the detailed job analyses drawn up by ATS
psychologists, as well as the ﬂuctuating demands for different categories
of employment. Auxiliaries were subsequently posted for specialist
training on the basis of this recommendation.59
Some recruits were sceptical of the newfangled ATS selection
methods: ‘These [aptitude] tests, we heard on good authority, had been
devised for the sole purpose of ﬁtting the maximum number of square
pegs into round holes’, quipped Eileen McMurdo.60 But there was
evidence to suggest that the revised procedures helped to ensure
women were allocated to the most suitable employment within the
service. A follow-up study was conducted to test the validity of the
PSOs’ recommendations and this revealed that of the 39,000 auxiliaries
who proceeded to specialised training between October 1942 and
October 1943, 94 per cent of trainees were successful in reaching the
standard required to warrant posting to their respective employments.
An opportunity was also taken to compare the performance of those
who had undergone the full selection process with those who had been
sent to specialist training without having been evaluated by a PSO. It
was found, for example, that while the training failure rates for clerks
and drivers selected under the modiﬁed system was 4% and 14%
respectively, it was 11% and 30% for the others.61 ‘Where the evidence

was available’, noted Senior Commander Mary Wickham, one of the
ATS psychologists who conducted this research, ‘wastage was at least
halved by the use of selection methods.’62
As for ofﬁcers, after the outbreak of war, they were mainly
drawn from the ranks and selected for ofﬁcer training after a short
interview with boards of senior ofﬁcers who sought to assess their
leadership potential.63 Margaret Egerton recounted her nervous
appearance before one such ATS panel. The ﬁfth daughter of the
Earl of Ellesmere, she had spent the early months of the conﬂict
undertaking clerical duties at various headquarters in Scottish
Command but, by her own admission, could only type with two
ﬁngers and was hopelessly confused by the numerous War Ofﬁce
acronyms:64
We were told we were to become ofﬁcers and we were sent up in
front of Dame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan, who was about a mile
high, with straight grey hair and gaiters – really, she was a man
and very terrifying. Another on the panel was Lady Maud
Baillie, very smart in kilt and uniform jacket.
. . . I marched in. ‘Sit Down, Egerton. Do you play hockey?’
‘No, ma’am.’ Did you go to school?’ ‘No, ma’am.’ Are you
a Girl Guide?’ ‘No, ma’am.’ They were absurd questions but
I found myself answering ‘No’ to all of them and thinking:
Please let me say ‘Yes’ to something.
‘Well, what are you? Are you a clerk?’ ‘Before the war, no,
ma’am. I ﬁnd clerk work very difﬁcult. I spend the whole
morning typing and the whole afternoon rubbing it out.’ They
roared with laughter.65
Egerton passed the board, but this largely subjective selection
method became increasingly anachronistic as the demand for ofﬁcers grew and candidates came to be drawn from outside the
traditional ofﬁcer class.66 Unsurprisingly, the members of these
panels also gained a reputation for allowing social class prejudices
to colour their judgements: ‘They look out for dirty nails, holes in
stockings and try to ﬁnd out if your mother was a char’,
reckoned Joan Wyndham.67 Although the WAAF and the WRNS
persevered with these interview boards, the ATS opted to modernise its ofﬁcer selection procedure and in 1943 extended the use of

1::79

psychological testing to those recommended for commissioned
rank.68
Under the new ATS ofﬁcer selection system, which closely
resembled that developed in the army, those who were considered to
be ofﬁcer material were sent to a female War Ofﬁce Selection Board
(WOSB) for forty-eight hours. At these establishments the candidates,
who were known only by numbers, undertook various intelligence,
personality and group tests in order to evaluate their leadership potential. These included the ‘leaderless’ group test, during which batches of
candidates were observed as they completed practical tasks. Attendees
might also be interviewed by a psychiatrist in order to detect any
unrecognised qualities or underlying instability. It was found that
most of the testing procedures employed at the male WOSBs could be
adapted for women. But those designed merely to measure powers of
endurance and physical courage were deemed to be ‘unsuitable’ for
female personnel, who would not be expected to lead their women
into action, and were thus omitted from the programme.69 Other reﬁnements were also advocated for the ATS selection boards. It was suggested that since the average age of auxiliaries was ‘markedly lower’
than soldiers, and that many of the former had come directly into the
forces from home, female candidates needed to be capable of exerting
a ‘mother’ style of leadership (‘a woman who is essentially interested in
each of her auxiliaries as an individual and whose outstanding quality is
kindly understanding’). Likewise, given the fact that those ATS ofﬁcers
without operational duties tended to undertake more administrative
work than the average army ofﬁcer, so bureaucratic competence was
considered to be of enhanced signiﬁcance. Moreover, it was contended
that female ofﬁcers needed to be able to get on better with the other sex
than their male colleagues:
The majority of ATS ofﬁcers have to work directly or indirectly
in co-operation with male ofﬁcers, while in the Army, a comparatively small proportion of the ofﬁcers will need to co-operate with
women ofﬁcers. It is, therefore, important to select women as
ofﬁcers who will be able to work happily with men, and who
will not err either on the side of being too shy and distant, too
emotional or too dictatorial. Suspicion that a candidate would
have difﬁculty in maintaining such a friendly relation with men
should make the ATS Board hesitate about passing her.70

59 / Selection
During 1943, some 4,800 auxiliaries went through this new selection
process, of whom a third were sent on to ofﬁcer training.71 The selection
process was an uncomfortable experience for many. Olivia Scovell
acknowledged that ‘The WOSB was an ordeal. For forty-eight hours
we had to do things pretty well non-stop, and everything we did was
watched and noted.’72 In her case, this included a practical group
exercise, which involved constructing an overnight shelter from items
of farmyard rubbish, during which she was ‘fully aware that my insular
activity was not really showing the right Girl Guide spirit’, and the
completion of ‘an appalling paper which asked us to give a description
of ourselves as seen, ﬁrst, through the eyes of our best friend, and then,
through the eyes of our worst enemy. It was like baring one’s soul.’73
Scovell (who failed to make the grade and returned to the ranks) was
also surprised to ﬁnd a curious emphasis on the candidates’ future role
as homemakers. She recalled that at the end of her selection period they
were all called together for a farewell speech from the female president
of the board:
It was a talk which she must have learnt by heart, and the same
message was obviously given on dozens of these partings. All
those who attended WOSBs could almost quote it. It blended
condolences with congratulations, and ﬁnished off on the lines,
‘For those of you who have passed, I know that you will make
splendid ofﬁcers. For those who have not passed, I know that
you will continue to do your duty. For all of you, however,
I know that some day you will get your heart’s wish and become
wonderful wives and mothers!’
As we left shortly afterwards I heard several mutterings of
‘What on earth a WOSB has to do with wives and mothers
I can’t imagine!’74

4 WORK
The Expansion of Roles
On the eve of war, the range of jobs undertaken by the women’s
services was very limited in scope. As we have seen, in the WAAF,
women were employed in six categories of work: as cooks, clerks,
orderlies, equipment assistants, motor drivers and balloon fabric
workers.1 In the ATS, they were utilised in ﬁve categories: as cooks,
clerks, orderlies, storewomen and motor drivers.2 And in the WRNS,
they were also deployed in ﬁve categories: as cooks, writers, stewards,
motor drivers and communication workers.3 All of these duties were
non-combatant roles that, in the words of one naval commander, could
be categorised as ‘conventionally applicable to women’.4
Once hostilities commenced, new job opportunities soon
opened up. Manpower shortages compelled the military authorities to
broaden the span of employments in order to release servicemen for
combatant duties.5 Moreover, as women proved themselves proﬁcient
in their new military roles, so the male service establishment became
more sanguine about extending their functions further.6 The three
service departments tended to decide these matters on a case-by-case
basis.7 In the Air Ministry, for example, a standing committee was
established in the autumn of 1940 to assess the practicability of substituting Waafs for airmen in RAF employments not previously open to
the WAAF. This substitution committee, which was composed of senior
RAF ofﬁcers from relevant directorates, together with DWAAF, met on

61 / The Expansion of Roles
seventy-one occasions during the war. It was guided by the principle
that ‘no work should be done by a man which could be done efﬁciently
by a woman’.8 This involved an analysis of such factors as the degree of
physical strength required, the location and working conditions of
certain RAF stations, the operational risks involved in high training
failure rates and whether employing women on the maintenance of
aircraft would have ‘the psychological effect on aircrew of giving them
unnecessary worries’.9 On occasions, such evaluations resulted in
a stark reassessment of traditional gender assumptions. In the spring
of 1941, the committee considered the possibility of employing Waafs in
the more technical RAF trades. The initial view was that this was not
feasible because ‘women had not an inherent mechanical instinct and
consequently could not be trained to reach the degree of skill
required’.10 However, after experiments in certain trades proved ‘highly
successful’, the committee revised its opinion and by the summer of
1943 Waafs were employed across all RAF trade groups.11 Constance
Woodhead summarised this change of perception:
the mental picture conjured up by the sceptics of a girl gazing in
bewilderment at a large aircraft engine and weeping because of
the grease on her hands and face, gradually faded. It changed to
an actual picture of a brisk, capable young woman in overalls,
hair tucked under a beret, scrambling over an aircraft, almost to
the manner born.12
When all army establishments were formally speciﬁed as comprising
‘military “and/or ATS” personnel’, Leslie Whateley saw it as a sign that
the army had come to regard the ATS as ‘in substitution for’ soldiers,
rather than merely as an ‘encumbrance or addition’.13
Over the course of the war there was a dramatic expansion in
the variety of jobs open to servicewomen – many of which were customarily ‘masculine’ in nature. In the WAAF, women came to be engaged
in approximately eighty categories of work. These included such duties
as an acetyelne welder, ﬂight mechanic, air frame ﬁtter, electrician,
instrument repairer and barrage balloon operator. In the WRNS,
women were placed in some ninety categories. These comprised such
tasks as a ship mechanic, torpedowoman, despatch rider, bomb range
marker, boats’ crew and boom defence Wren. In the ATS, women were
assimilated into roughly 130 categories. These encompassed such occupations as a sheet metal worker, carpenter, vehicle mechanic, armourer,

searchlight operator and instrument number in an anti-aircraft
battery.14 One contemporary commentator on the participation of
women in the war effort, Vera Douie, remarked that these were functions ‘quite undreamt of in earlier times.’15
Some of these roles came close to being combatant in character.
WRNS boom defence Wrens – ‘boom defence’ having little to do with
the true nature of their activities – despatched free-ﬂying latex balloons

the prevailing winds, with the intention of igniting forest ﬁres and
damaging overhead power lines in Germany.16 WAAF barrage balloon
operators ﬁtted explosive charges to the cables of the balloons to help
bring down enemy aircraft that ﬂew too close to their blimps.17 ATS
operational numbers in anti-aircraft batteries worked the ﬁre-control
apparatus that located targets and directed the gunﬁre.18 The AdjutantGeneral, General Sir Ronald Adam, acknowledged that the noncombatant status of these female ‘gunners’ was decidedly ambiguous:
‘it must be admitted that in the case of AA batteries the distinction was
rather “thin”’.19
Occupational hierarchies soon began to develop within the
women’s services. In the ATS, auxiliaries undertaking jobs that were
deemed ‘manly’ and close to the ‘frontline’, such as those working
on anti-aircraft gun sites, tended to enjoy the highest prestige.20 In
the WAAF, it might have been expected that those employed on
barrage balloon sites would have been held in similar esteem. Yet
they were looked down on by others in their service. Instead, it was
the aircraft plotters in the operations rooms at the RAF bomber and

ﬁghter stations who were regarded – and were prone to regard
themselves – as the superior beings. Tessa Stone has suggested that
this was partly due to class distinctions – the ‘rougher’ types of
women were said to man the barrage balloons, whilst the more
genteel gravitated towards the plotting tables – but it was mainly
a result of their closer proximity to combat ﬂying operations and
thus their more tangible contribution to the RAF war effort.21 Hazel
Williams admitted that her fellow plotters ‘were very snooty and
considered that they were to the other WAAF trades what RAF Air
Crew were to ground trades’.22 Rebecca Barnett conﬁrmed that, as
a WAAF teleprinter operator, the plotters she came into contact
with ‘often had noticeable upper-crust accents and the sort of manner that went with it . . . On the other hand, we, the signals lot, put
ourselves above some trades too.’23 It is arguably the genteel image
of WAAF plotters tracking the movement of aircraft around plotting
tables like croupiers at a roulette table that has become one of the
dominant motifs in representations of women’s wartime military
service.24

Such was the allure of ‘ops’ that a few plucky airwomen managed to smuggle themselves onto RAF missions. Rosemary Britten,
a WAAF intelligence ofﬁcer at RAF Earls Colne, clandestinely joined
the crew of a Halifax bomber in 296 Squadron as it towed a Horsa glider
full of troops across to Germany during Operation Varsity: the airborne
crossing of the Rhine in the spring of 1945. She refrained from applying
her usual powder and lipstick ‘because I wanted to look like a German
girl in case of bailing out’ and the crew carried her parachute and ‘Mae
West’ (life jacket) to the aircraft ‘so that I merely looked like a love-sick
Waff ofﬁcer bidding a fond farewell to the brave unto the very last
moment’. Badly damaged by anti-aircraft ﬁre over the landing zone,
the Halifax was forced down on an airﬁeld in France. On returning to
the UK, Britten, who was thought to have been killed when other crews
mistakenly reported that the aircraft had been destroyed, was carpeted
by a female superior over her illicit ﬂight: ‘I had an hour’s lecture and
was threatened with the AOC [Air Ofﬁcer Commanding] and dire
consequences if anyone let it out. Awful tales of questions asked in the
House. As a matter of a fact I think she was jealous.’25

Despite the great expansion of roles during the war years, there
were limits to this process. The majority of servicewomen continued to
be utilised in ‘feminine’ jobs. By the ﬁnal stages of the conﬂict, roughly
two thirds of those across the three women’s services were engaged in
catering, domestic, clerical or communications work.26 In the ATS, for
example, 11% of its total strength at the start of 1945 were employed in
catering, 15% in communications, 16% in domestic, and 28% in clerical posts.27 What was more, even those undertaking more ‘masculine’
duties could ﬁnd themselves performing ‘housekeeping’ chores for their
male colleagues. Norma Lodge and her fellow ATS radio location
mechanics dubbed themselves the ‘Charminster Chars’ when they
were required to clean and polish the workshops on top of their

technical work.28 Likewise, WAAF aircraft electrician, Joan Bulpitt,
was not given any ‘proper’ electrical work to do at RAF Keevil and
was simply ordered to ‘keep the stove stoked up, and fetch tea and cakes
from the Naaﬁ! I became very good at crosswords.’29
In addition, servicewomen were never fully interchangeable
with men across a number of jobs. The long hours and physical strength
required for certain functions meant that male counterparts were not
always replaced on a one-for-one basis. In the ATS, 44 per cent of its
personnel in early 1945 were deployed on duties with a more generous
ﬁve-for-four or three-for-two replacement ratio.30 Moreover, within the
nominally one-for-one posts, women were sometimes restricted as to
what tasks they could perform. In the WAAF, air frame ﬁtters were not
8:

allowed to work outdoors at night; motor mechanics were forbidden to
hand start heavy engines from cold; armament assistants were not
permitted to ﬁre guns; and tailoresses were proscribed from ﬁtting airmen’s clothes.31 Indeed, in the autumn of 1942, an Air Council letter
speciﬁed that while RAF personnel were required to work a minimum of
sixty hours per week, Waafs were limited to forty-eight hours, except in
cases where they were working side by side with the men and which
made different hours impractical.32
Furthermore, there were a range of jobs from which servicewomen were excluded. Whilst Wrens, for instance, were employed as
submarine attack teachers, which involved operating a simulator that
trained submarine captains in the latest tactics for attacking enemy
ships,33 there was resistance to Waafs serving as ﬂight simulator instructors. Airmen, it was believed, ‘might not take kindly to having their
faults corrected by women’.34 In similar terms, although civilian women
pilots in the Air Transport Auxiliary were utilised to ferry RAF aircraft
between factories, storage depots and operational air bases, Waafs did
not undertake comparable ﬂying duties.35 Air Chief Marshal Sir
Trafford Leigh-Mallory, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied
Expeditionary Air Force, found it ‘astounding’ that the WAAF should
not share in the RAF’s essential function of ﬂying, especially since
members of the ATS helped to man AA batteries, and that this ‘pedestrian, Safety First policy’ put the service at a grave disadvantage in
recruiting ‘the best and most adventurous type of woman’.36 Most
notably, however, servicewomen remained ﬁrmly barred from undertaking direct combatant roles in the forces. These included acting as
aircrew in RAF squadrons, as seamen on Royal Navy warships and as
soldiers in frontline ﬁghting units of the army.37 As one early ATS
recruiting poster starkly put it: ‘The men will do the ﬁghting, you
must do the rest.’38
This denial of combatant status extended to the use of ﬁrearms.
As Corinna Peniston-Bird has demonstrated, there were ‘fuzzy’ gender
boundaries in operation here since those serving as armourers repaired
riﬂes, pistols and machine guns, whilst others visited weapons ranges to
learn to shoot. ATS ofﬁcer Lavinia Orde nonchalantly recalled volunteering for instruction in ﬁring a Tommy gun, a Bren gun and a PIAT
anti-tank weapon whilst attached to General Montgomery’s headquarters in South Eastern Command.39 Nevertheless, servicewomen were
technically prohibited from personally using lethal weapons as part of

69 / The Expansion of Roles
their duties.40 This led to a good deal of uncertainty as to what ‘defensive role’ they should play if they found themselves in the presence of the
enemy at close quarters. In the different orders of battles for local
defence schemes, members of the ATS, for example, were variously
required ‘to take shelter with the civilian population’; ‘render First
Aid, assist with communications, or carry out other non-ﬁghting duties’;
and ‘use Arms in defence of their HQ, or in self-defence in the last
resort’.41 Precisely which instructions were given was said to be dependent on the ‘imaginative ability’ of male commanders and ‘their opinion
on the usefulness of women as a whole’.42
This institutional aversion to female combat and the bearing of
arms seems to have been largely driven by deep-seated gender conventions. Edith Summerskill, who mounted a vigorous but unsuccessful
campaign to convince the War Ofﬁce to permit women to serve as
combatant members of the Home Guard, suggested that the underlying
cause was a ‘nineteenth-century conception of womanhood’ which
determined that ‘women are still weak, gentle creatures who must be
protected’.43 Penny Summerﬁeld speculates that there might have been
deeper psychological concerns lurking in the male service mind, that
associated the gun with the phallus and gave rise to fears of ‘collective
emasculation’.44 Yet a distaste for female combat was not an exclusively
male phenomenon. Vera Laughton Mathews opined that while she
would not forbid female personnel using lethal weapons – and ‘boom
defence’ Wrens apparently received some weapons training to defend
their launch site – women were simply not designed for killing:
As one who believes that the similarities between men and
women are much more marked than their differences, I would
say that one of those differences lies in the taking of human life.
The women’s part in producing life is so inﬁnitely greater than
the man’s, that one feels she must do violence to her nature in
deliberately destroying life.45
Jean Knox seems to have held similar views:
Women have won a merited place in the active army, but they
cannot be trained to kill. I don’t believe women can take life as
men can. I know nothing of Russia [where women were fulﬁlling combat roles in the wartime armed forces], but I know

8:

70 / Work
women. Women give life. They are not designed to take life,
even in total war.46
Jane Trefusis Forbes offered a different perspective. She regarded her
force as an integral part of the RAF’s ‘ﬁghting chain’ and thus the
question of killing was more one of semantics than conceptions about
‘the womanliness of women’.47 Nonetheless, from a post-war perspective, the DATS, Mary Tyrwhitt, believed that the ‘defensive role’ of
auxiliaries in the face of the enemy had been left unresolved: ‘I feel
that during the 1939/45 war we managed to skim over this fact by
reason of the essential “temporariness” of the ATS and of the crying
need of the Army for additional pairs of hands’.48

ATS in Anti-Aircraft Command
The servicewomen who perhaps came closest to challenging the
combat taboo were the ATS ‘gunners’ in Anti-Aircraft Command.
Before the outbreak of war, Major-General Sir Frederick Pile, the
unblimpish AA chief, had begun to consider the possibility of employing
women in an operational role. In 1938 he invited a leading female
engineer, Caroline Haslett, to advise him on their capacity to operate
the ﬁre-control instruments in anti-aircraft batteries. After a series of
weekend visits to gun sites in the Surrey hills, suitably armed with
mackintosh and umbrella, she assured him that they could perform
this function if called upon to do so.49
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Pile wrote to the War Ofﬁce
ﬂoating the idea of utilising the ATS operationally in his command.50
The response was predictably frosty: ‘there can be no question of the
employment of members of the ATS on operational duties of
a combatant nature’, pronounced the Director of Military Operations
and Plans, ‘ . . . unless and until the man-power position becomes
acute’.51 By the end of 1940, with the Blitz in full swing, this scenario
had arisen. AA Command was nearly 18,000 under strength and Pile,
who was already deploying many members of the ATS nonoperationally as cooks, clerks, drivers and orderlies, approached the
army authorities again over the matter. He proposed that the ATS be
allowed to replace some male ﬁre-control operators in anti-aircraft
batteries in order to help alleviate the manpower shortfall.52

71 / ATS in Anti-Aircraft Command
The prospect of women going into action alongside Royal
Artillery gunners on gun sites was anathema to some within the military
establishment – what the author of AA Command’s internal wartime
history described as ‘ﬂuttering the dovecotes with a vengeance’.53 But
Pile received timely backing from a War Ofﬁce committee, under Air
Marshal Sir Philip Joubert (at this time an assistant chief of the Air
Staff), which had been set up to inquire into the organisation of his
command in light of the manpower shortages. It supported Pile’s proposal as a means of economising on personnel and concluded that ‘any
objections would nowadays appear to be sentimental rather than
practical.’54 The endorsement of the Joubert committee swung the
matter. Although Sir James Grigg, the Permanent Under-Secretary of
State for War, dubbed Pile’s proposal ‘breath-taking and revolutionary’,
in the spring of 1941 the Army Council gave its consent.55 The War
Cabinet added its own blessing shortly thereafter.56 Pile wrote of ‘outraged cries of horror from the diehards. But it was pure mathematics
that forced everybody’s hand’.57
In the early summer, the mixed-sex anti-aircraft batteries began
to take shape.58 The ATS would operate the ﬁre-control instruments
that located the targets and directed the gunﬁre, but Royal Artillery
personnel would ﬁre the guns. This ostensibly protected the women’s
non-combatant status, yet entailed a degree of sophistry. It was a matter
of debate, for example, whether there was a signiﬁcant difference
between manning a predictor machine, which fed information to the
gun crews about the predicted course of hostile aircraft, and pulling the
ﬁring lever of a 3.7 inch gun: both were essential to bringing down the
German bombers.59 ‘There was a good deal of muddled thinking’,
commented Pile, ‘which was prepared to allow women to do anything
to kill the enemy except actually press the trigger’.60 It was also the case
that ATS ‘gunners’ continued to rely on their male colleagues for armed
protection against enemy parachutists or saboteurs attacking gun sites.
The ban on servicewomen using ﬁrearms led to the bizarre situation of
women undertaking guard duties equipped only with a stick and
a whistle.61
These new mixed batteries were ﬁrst deployed towards the end
of the summer.62 Inevitably there were teething troubles. On some of the
early gun sites, the soldiers and auxiliaries were naturally wary of one
another and had difﬁculties in gelling as a unit. Kina Manton, the senior
ATS ofﬁcer of one of the ﬁrst mixed AA regiments based near

Figure 4.7 ATS personnel serving at a 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun site, Wormwood

Edinburgh, recalled that ‘for the ﬁrst week or 10 days it was difﬁcult to
get the sexes even to speak to each other except when driven to it by
virtue of their work’.63 In tandem with this, there were concerns about
a male loss of face and a suspicion that the auxiliaries would get more
favourable treatment. One male ‘gunner’ ofﬁcer in AA Command
admitted that ‘the AT “invasion” is felt as a humiliation’ and that
there were fears ‘the men will have to do all the dirty work . . . while
the women do all the soft jobs’.64 Beyond the conﬁnes of the AA camps,
these strange new military phenomena were greeted by the public with
a mixture of inquisitiveness and suspicion. ATS ‘gunner’, Mari
Hopkins, remarked that when a mixed battery arrived on an AA site
‘its perimeter was haunted for the ﬁrst few days by local people staring
at the female curiosities and hoping, perhaps, to catch a glimpse of a pair
of khaki bloomers dangling from the barrel of an ack-ack gun’.65 Some
looked upon these units with deep moral concern. Manton, for example,
was accused by locals of being in effect the ‘madam’ of an army brothel.66
Gradually, however, a camaraderie developed in the batteries and public
attention waned as the novelty wore off.67 The commanding ofﬁcer of

73 / ATS in Anti-Aircraft Command
one of the ﬁrst mixed batteries confessed that he had ‘loathed’ the idea of
such a role, but there was ‘practically no difference at all between the
running of a mixed or any other battery’. He recorded that there had
developed ‘a really ﬁne spirit of mutual help between the sexes’ and that
in their ﬁrst action ‘everybody stood up to the ordeal extremely well’.68
By 1943, approximately 30,000 auxiliaries were manning the ﬁre-control
apparatuses on AA sites and Pile pronounced the mixed units ‘a triumphant success’.69 ‘The experiment’, he declared, ‘had exceeded even my
more sanguine hopes.’70
There were occasional cases of female ‘gunners’ breaking down
under the noise of the gunﬁre and being removed,71 but most seem to
have relished their ‘frontline’ duties. ATS staff ofﬁcer Mary Thomson
recalled that when a mixed battery near Weymouth shot down
a German plane and the pilot parachuted into the sea, the women
were so ﬁred up by the thrill of battle that after spotting the airman
attempting to get to the shore they shouted out to the rescue team:
‘Don’t save him, don’t save him!’72 They also displayed a good deal of
courage. When Private Nora Caveney, an eighteen-year-old predictor
operator from Walsden in Lancashire serving with 148 (M) Heavy AntiAircraft Regiment, was mortally wounded by a bomb splinter as she
tracked an enemy aircraft over the south coast in April 1942 – the ﬁrst
member of the ATS to be killed in action – her place was immediately
taken by a female colleague, Private Gladys Keel, who ensured that the
guns were able to keep ﬁring without interruption.73 Another predictor
operator who showed great calmness in action was Private Violette
Szabo (later to be posthumously awarded the George Cross for her
heroism as a secret agent with the Special Operations Executive in
occupied France).74 It was said that ‘Her jesting at moments of stress,
without a sign of ﬂuster or concern, happily proved infectious and
helped to allay the misgivings of the battery commander as to the
girls’ ability to face up to real danger.’75 For many auxiliaries it became
a matter of pride to perform as well as their male comrades when the
alarm sounded. ‘We were determined’, reminisced Betty Holbrook, ‘to
shine gloriously in any raid that might take place’.76 Elizabeth Hunter
conﬁded that she was prouder of having served with an AA battery than
any other role she performed in the service: ‘We thought we were
terriﬁc, we were the only girls actually ﬁghting.’77
Meanwhile, despite their ‘manly’ employment, the auxiliaries
did not abandon their femininity on the gun sites. Manton reported that

8:

74 / Work

Many, both male and female, had expressed a fear that the life
would make the women of a mixed unit ‘unfeminine’. They
would have felt re-assured if they could have heard the comments of the male ofﬁcers when knitting and embroidery made
an appearance in the command post. Instinctively it was forbidden, but the hours when nothing happened were long and
gradually the men were persuaded to see that neither activity
interfered with immediate readiness or efﬁciency and much
fancy work was done in unpromising surroundings.78
Dorothy Calvert, a radar operator in a mixed battery, corroborated
these feminine tendencies. Although she dressed like a male gunner and
learnt to swear, sing bawdy songs, drink beer and smoke – ‘no longer the
little village girl, but a bit of a rufﬁan’79 – she confessed to a periodic
female ‘weep in’:
A real feminine act, sitting on our beds, the Sgt. too, all howling
at once, very funny I suppose, but women were women, in
uniform or civvies, and no one could fathom the way the female
mind works or acts. We, after a good weep, would tidy up,
giggle, feel a lot better and get on with the work in hand.80
She also recalled that on Christmas Day in her battery the male gunner
ofﬁcers dressed up as the ATS, ‘make-up and all’, and served dinner to
the auxiliaries.81
The employment of women in the mixed batteries raised the
issue of whether the ATS should be more closely integrated into the
army. Pile was in favour of greater assimilation and pressed for his
auxiliaries to be enlisted in the Royal Artillery: ‘I could not see why, if
a woman was to play exactly the same part in a battery as a man, she
should be controlled by a women’s organization such as the ATS.’82 But
the female hierarchy ﬁrmly opposed this and saw in it the seeds of the
break-up of their institution. ‘The ATS were very jealous of their position’, continued Pile. ‘They were a woman’s service – run by women. No
male ofﬁcer should have any authority over them – nor was his advice
heeded. They were there to help the Army, but only as they thought
ﬁt.’83

This attitude was illustrated by an outburst from Jean Knox
whilst chairing a meeting of senior women ofﬁcers at the War Ofﬁce
shortly after the establishment of the mixed batteries. Manton attended
the meeting and was subjected to a vituperative attack from the head of
her service when she suggested that her auxiliaries’ allegiances tended to
lie with their batteries rather than with the ATS:
After a harangue from the chair on the importance of being
loyal to our own Service, separateness, building a ﬁne body of
women and the undesirability of the Army having anything to

do with us, we were asked our opinions individually as to
whether the ATS rank and ﬁle should be loyal ﬁrst to their
regiments or to the ATS . . . When my turn came, with my
usual tact I said winning the war mattered most of all and that
the ATS were in fact loyal to their units ﬁrst last and all the time
and that this was a ‘good thing’. The ATS was too vast for them
to visualise as a living entity anyway and women would serve
what was personal and near at hand. The result startled me –
Jean Knox called me a lot of things, sacked me out of hand,
burst into tears and rushed from the room!84
In fact, Manton – who, it should be noted, was quickly reinstated by
Knox’s deputy, Leslie Whateley – went as far as to claim that ‘our own
ATS higher command did not believe in us, did not understand what we
were aiming at and even perhaps hoped we would not succeed’.85
The ATS authorities won this particular battle and, with the
support of Adam, who maintained that the women’s conditions of
service would be better safeguarded under the existing arrangements,
the female ‘gunners’ were not subsumed into the Royal Artillery.86 Pile
concluded that ‘in this laudable ambition of getting the girls equal
status . . . I was more of a feminist than the members of the ATS
Directorate’.87 Nevertheless, as Shelford Bidwell points out, ‘some sensible concessions were made to regimental feeling, without impugning
the loyalty owed to the Service’.88 Women serving with the batteries
were permitted to wear the RA grenade badge on their blouses, the AA
Command formation sign on their sleeves and the white gunner lanyard
on their shoulders. On the gun sites, female ‘corporals’ were addressed
as ‘bombardier’ and female ‘privates’ as ‘gunner’.89 In the meantime,
Knox, whose relations with the army authorities became increasingly
strained, resigned ‘for reasons of health’ in the autumn of 1943 and was
replaced by Whateley.90
In addition to their service in the mixed gun batteries, members
of the ATS were also employed on searchlight duties in AA Command.
These entailed illuminating enemy aircraft in the powerful beams, in
order to aid the anti-aircraft gun crews. Despite some concerns within
the War Ofﬁce about whether women would be ‘temperamentally or
physically capable of enduring the hardship, the night watches and the
tedium of searchlight manning’,91 in 1942, ATS detachments were
deployed to Royal Artillery searchlight units and, uniquely, an ‘all-

female’ ATS searchlight regiment – the 93rd – was formed.92 In the
initial stages, the regiment did receive some surreptitious male assistance
with the heavy mechanical tasks on its small, isolated searchlight sites.
Pile conﬁded that
We had to keep very dark about the fact that on most of these
sites, in the early days of the experiment, there lived in a tent
a solitary and carefully chosen gunner. It can be imagined what
play could have been made by the more prurient sections of the

8:

78 / Work
Press with the fact that among these unchaperoned young
women lurked a solitary male soldier. His duty was to swing
the heavy Diesel generator, in the days before this equipment
was ﬁtted with a self-starter. We never had any trouble from
these solitary gunners, and as the matter never reached the ears
of the politicians all was well.93
The regiment was also handicapped by its inability to defend itself
against enemy aircraft. One of the tactics the German pilots adopted
was to ﬂy down the beams of these units in order to shoot out the
searchlights and a particular complaint of the 93rd was that its auxiliaries were not permitted, like their male counterparts, to protect their
sites with machine guns. Manton, who came to know the regiment well
when it was serving in her AA brigade near London, observed that ‘all
they wanted was the chance to hit back, instead of having to behave like
sitting ducks’.94 Nonetheless, Pile stated that
all in all, the experiment was every bit as great a success as it had
been in the case of the Heavy AA regiments . . . Every time
I visited such a site, and it was much easier to go there than to
get away, I wondered why we were ever such fools as to doubt
that the thing would work.
And work it did. The girls lived like men, fought their lights
like men, and, alas, some of them died like men. Unarmed, they
often showed great personal bravery.95
One former member of the 93rd, Elizabeth Oldham, found the experience of serving with the regiment exhilarating: ‘We spent long hours
awake, waiting – but when we got something in our sights it was
fantastic.’ She also enjoyed the esteem of belonging to such
a distinctive operational unit: ‘We were unique, and when I ﬁrst went
home my father walked me all round Stockport, he was so proud.’96

Workmates
Inevitably, there was a good deal of suspicion on the part of
servicemen across the armed forces to the prospect of working alongside
women. WAAF ﬂight mechanic, Dorothy Hobson, recalled, for example, that ‘the airmen in our hangar didn’t seem very happy to see us and
the Flt/Sgt didn’t seem to know what to do with us’.97 WRNS boats’

crew, Pamela Burningham, recollected that the reaction of her chief
petty ofﬁcer was ‘girls in the Navy, whatever next? Flighty young things,
can’t expect them to do a man’s job properly.’98 Indeed, a number of
senior ofﬁcers tried to avoid employing women at all. Constance
Woodhead admitted that ‘it was years before some commanding ofﬁcers
could be induced to accept a WAAF section on their stations’.99 In
similar vein, Vera Laughton Mathews observed that ‘there were naval
ofﬁcers who declared that they would ﬁght against having WRNS to the
last ditch’.100
The female personnel could be given a tough time at work by
their male colleagues. There were schoolboy jokes at the women’s
expense. Working in a naval store, Wren Jean Rawson was asked for
such items as ‘tartan paint’ and ‘left-handed hammers’.101 There was
a reluctance to help women struggling with their jobs. When WAAF
driver, Peggy Wells, approached an airman to help crank up her tractor
delivering bombs to aircraft he refused: ‘You joined up to replace
a man so get on with it.’102 Sometimes women were deliberately
snubbed. ATS ofﬁcer K. T. Mannock recalled that when she was
posted to a staff role at the War Ofﬁce, her male superior ofﬁcer
‘totally ignored my presence and made no effort to give me any work
to do. He was, I suppose, one of the old school who thought the little
woman’s place was in the home’.103 In turn, some servicemen could be
teased by their male colleagues if they worked closely with female
personnel. Burningham recounted that her male coxswain, Nobby
Clarke, who had survived a torpedoing whilst on a Russia-bound
convoy and been given an ‘easy’ job while he recovered, was referred
to as ‘Wren Clarke’ by the sailors.104
There were also instances of sexual harassment. This could take
various forms. WAAF photographic assistant, Pamela Brisley-Wilson,
recalled one RAF NCO, ‘an ageing, ugly, bumptious, dirty, old man’,
who would gather together groups of young airwomen and tell them
‘quite disgusting jokes. Half of them I was quite sure didn’t understand
them.’105 WAAF waitress, Morfydd Brooks, recollected that in the
sergeants’ mess at RAF Scampton the air would be blue with sexual
innuendos:
The doors would burst open and the Aircrews would swarm in
shouting boisterously. As we served their food we young Waafs
had to endure a barrage of good natured banter. ‘How about

8:

a date Darling?’, ‘How is your Sex life?’, ‘I dreamt about you
last night’, ‘Would you like to sleep with me?’, ‘Please serve us in
the nude’. Then someone would shout, what is the collective
noun for Waafs? They would answer, the collective noun for
Waafs is ‘A Mattress of Waafs’. They would all then erupt into
hilarity.106
Sometimes such ‘banter’ would spill over into attempted sexual assault.
ATS clerk, Lois Goossens, was forced to make a dash past a table of
‘rough and ready’ Black Watch soldiers during mealtimes in her mess
hall in order to avoid being molested: ‘if their Sgt. Major caught them
making a grab for us, he walloped them with his baton’.107 Likewise,
middle-aged male ofﬁcers could use their privileged position in the
military hierarchy to harass young servicewomen. WRNS typist Penny
Martin had to manoeuvre herself out of the unwelcome clutches of her
naval ofﬁcer boss: ‘He had tried to get more than somewhat familiar late
one night when we were alone in his ofﬁce (on business) and I was
shocked out of my socks . . . I made it quite clear that the whole idea was
repulsive.’108 At their naval base, WRNS signaller, Edith Dixon, and her
female colleagues were required to work in pairs at night on the switchboard to safeguard them from the male ratings.109
Some brave servicewomen decided they were simply not going
to put up with this treatment and complained to the military authorities.
One such woman was Mary Thomson (then Mary Dixon). She had
a particularly harrowing experience whilst serving at the headquarters
of an anti-aircraft division in Newcastle. The ‘revolting’ male majorgeneral, she remembered, began to take an unhealthy interest in her. He
would encourage her to sit next to him at meal times; he asked his
batman to visit her billet with a view, she believed, to reconnoitring
the entrances; he would caress her bare arms when in shirt-sleeve order;
and he attempted to grope her under a rug on the back seat of his ofﬁcial
car during a visit to a RAF base. The denouement came when he asked
her into his ofﬁce one morning, locked the door, and literally chased her
around his desk and settee before she somehow managed to escape from
the room. The shock of the incident was such that she was unable to
recall how she evaded his grasp, but ‘I can remember the horror of it and
thinking how is this going to end’. Thomson, however, was now convinced that this man was a serious menace and as the daughter of an
archdeacon and god-daughter of a ﬁeld marshal she was certainly not

intimidated by the trappings of rank. She thus made an ofﬁcial complaint to her military superiors, was interviewed by the relevant AntiAircraft Corps commander in Edinburgh, and told him that she was
quite prepared if necessary to repeat the allegations in front of the Army
Council. The offending general – who, it was rumoured, had already
been posted away from a previous appointment because of ‘trouble’
with an ATS driver – was removed. Nevertheless, despite this victory,
she could not escape a pang of guilt: ‘I really felt awful because he was
a sick man.’110
The proprieties to be observed between senior male ofﬁcers and
their female subordinates could lead on occasion to friction with the
women’s services. When Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, the Commander-inChief of the Home Fleet, discovered that his WRNS chauffeur, Wren
Cockerham, had never been on board a warship, he invited her and two
other Wrens to be shown around HMS Duke of York in Scapa Flow and
take tea on his ﬂagship. This, however, contravened WRNS regulations

which laid down that Wrens were only allowed on board ships in
organised groups and on speciﬁed days. A bitter row blew up between
Fraser and the WRNS hierarchy in Orkney.111 WRNS Chief Ofﬁcer
Macpherson at Lyness contended that such a ﬂagrant breach of the rules
would undermine discipline, lead to jealousy and resentment on the part
of Wrens who did not receive such an invitation, and imperil the ‘moral
reputation’ of her service.112 For his part, Fraser was indignant at the
attitude of the local WRNS ofﬁcers and, as commander-in-chief,
believed that if he wanted to show his appreciation to those who worked
for him, his wishes should be complied with.113 Such was the strength of
feeling on the part of the WRNS ofﬁcers over this issue that Macpherson
and two of her female colleagues requested to be discharged from the
service.114 In the end, the dispute was defused after Vera Laughton
Mathews visited Fraser in Orkney and bluntly told him that the rules
had been made because ‘they had been found necessary’, that unofﬁcial
visits were ‘liable to misunderstanding’, and that he should ‘show the
way to the Fleet’. The Admiral promised to toe the line but, given
Macpherson’s ‘uncompromising attitude’ and ‘present frame of mind’,
her discharge from the WRNS was arranged.115
Such conventions could sometimes inhibit the appointment of
servicewomen to personal assistant posts within the military hierarchy.
In what has been described as a ‘hitherto unheard-of step’, LieutenantGeneral Sir Andrew Thorne, the Commander-in-Chief of Scottish
Command, invited Mary MacDonald, a subaltern in the ATS, to join
his staff as a second aide-de-camp, partly in response, she suspected, to
Russian criticism that the western allies were not making full use of
women. Yet he was subsequently forced to cancel the appointment of
this highly-efﬁcient ofﬁcer (later to become a lecturer in politics and
fellow of Somerville College, Oxford) when, according to MacDonald,
‘higher authority’ hinted that it was not ‘proper’ for the army commander to travel round his command with an unmarried woman: ‘The driver
was insufﬁcient chaperone.’116
Despite these tensions, as time went on, male-female working
relations seem to have settled down. Dorothy Hobson recorded that
after the frosty reception she received from airmen, the competence she
displayed at her job eventually secured her their approval. One night she
took her usual place at the WAAF table in the cookhouse but was called
over by one of her male colleagues. ‘“Come and sit with us,” he said to
her, “if you’re good enough to work with – you’re good enough to eat

with.” I picked up my plate and mug of tea and went to sit with them. At
long last, I felt that they had accepted me as a fellow mechanic.’117
Likewise, Pamela Burningham remembered one day overhearing
a private conversation between her hard-bitten chief petty ofﬁcer and
another chief in the bosun’s stores. ‘“Don’t you criticise them girls”, she
heard the former say. “Better than your lads in many ways. Do their jobs
well, they do.” So we knew he was an old softie really.’118
Some formerly sceptical senior ofﬁcers became effusive in their
praise of female personnel. ‘When I was told that I should have to take
a large number of ATS’, admitted the army commandant of a Royal
Army Ordnance Corps depot, ‘I was horriﬁed at the thought. I did not
like it at all. Within six months I had completely changed my views.
They were magniﬁcent.’119 The Royal Navy commander of a submarine
depot wrote in similar terms of his Wrens: ‘I say quite frankly that
I didn’t like their presence . . .. However it wasn’t long before I became
completely converted. The Wrens behaved splendidly.’120 These sentiments were shared by a RAF group captain: ‘When the ﬁrst little trickle
of Waafs drifted into my station I was inwardly rather resentful . . . .
How wrong I was . . . thank Goodness that this country could produce
such a race of women as the Waafs on my station.’121 ‘In the end,
curiously enough,’ remarked Constance Woodhead, ‘some of the most
persistent antagonists of women in the service became among the most
ardent in their admiration and support of the WAAF.’122
For their part, many women came to identify strongly with units
of their ‘parent’ service. Not only did this apply, as we have seen, to the
auxiliaries in the mixed AA batteries, but was also a particular hallmark
of the Waafs who worked at the operational air bases. They tended to
develop a close afﬁnity with the RAF aircrew ﬂying combat missions.
Radio-telephone operator Pip Beck recorded ‘the relief if all the aircraft
returned safely; or the sad, empty feeling if someone was missing’.123
Special Duties Clerk Patricia Thom remembered that ‘we were always
watching and waiting for them to come back, hoping they’d all make
it’.124 After many of Morfydd Brooks’s ﬂyers failed to return from the
Dambusters’ raid in 1943, she and her fellow waitresses ‘burst into
tears’ at the sight of the empty tables in the mess the following day.
Over the next few weeks they were posted away to work with different
squadrons: ‘the Higher Ups thought that we Waafs had become too
involved with the Aircrews to function efﬁciently and therefore we must
be separated. I think they were right.’125

Airwomen also took on unofﬁcial ‘maternal’ roles for ﬂyers.
While some darned socks and sewed wings on RAF uniforms for their
male colleagues,126 others became part of a psychological support network. Edna Skeen, the WAAF ‘map queen’ at RAF Scampton, became
a lucky charm for superstitious airmen: ‘After each brieﬁng, each would
touch me on the shoulder and say, “See you tonight.” This became
a ritual and they considered it bad luck if they went out without touching my shoulder.’127 Grace Archer, a WAAF intelligence ofﬁcer at RAF
Mildenhall, was asked by her station medical ofﬁcer to keep a look out
for ﬂyers suffering from nervous exhaustion: ‘I felt it to be a tribute to
his faith in me that he asked me to let him know if I thought any aircrew
member needed his help, as I saw more of them than he did.’128 Another
WAAF intelligence ofﬁcer, Edith Kup, recollected that she and other
airwomen at RAF Pocklington often found themselves comforting
anxious and distressed aircrew. She remembered consoling a navigator
trembling with nerves:
He was in a dreadful state, he’d had some pretty rough trips
and was shaking like a leaf. It all came out and he had a good
cry on my shoulder. I talked to him rather like one of my
horses frightened by rough handling . . .. Eventually he felt
better and off he went to bed. I am pleased to say he survived
the war. He wasn’t the only one and I’m sure the other girls
had similar experiences, though no one ever mentioned it.
These things were sacrosanct, and the boys knew they could
trust us.129
Jenny Nicholson conﬁrmed that the bonds with the aircrews were
especially strong among the Waafs directly involved in ‘ops’:
What most impressed me was how completely the women who
were closely connected with the planning and carrying out of
operations had adopted the characteristic behaviour of the men
who were compelled to live and die in an atmosphere of superlatives and habitual tragedies. I was in an Ops room immediately before a bombing operation. The crew came in to the
Cypher ofﬁcer to empty their pockets. A morbid enough performance at any time. A sergeant pilot placed the items of his
pocket-collection on the desk one by one. String, letters, money,
a lump of sugar pinched from the Mess, a diary and two toffees.

The WAAF Code and Cypher Ofﬁcer checked the assortment,
tied it up into a neat little bundle and locked it in a safe. ‘Tell
Mum I died happy,’ joked the Sergeant Pilot. ‘Only the good die
young,’ she reminded him. ‘Good show – then I’ll live to tell the
tale.’ Actually he didn’t.130
Airwomen in these operational roles were sometimes ﬁrst-hand witnesses to the agonies of ﬂyers in combat. Aileen Clayton, an intelligence
ofﬁcer at RAF West Kingsdown during the Battle of Britain, recounted
that the female staff intercepting Luftwaffe radio trafﬁc were able to
listen into German formation leaders ordering their aircraft to dive onto
unwitting RAF ﬁghter pilots below but, to their frustration, had no
means of warning them in time: ‘I would often hear one of the WAAF
operators murmuring: “Oh God, . . . oh God, . . . please, . . . please look
up . . . ”, and I knew how helpless she felt.’131 They also facilitated ‘kills’.
On one occasion at RAF Hawkinge, Clayton and her team were
instructed to call in No. 11 Fighter Group when they detected
a familiar German reconnaissance pilot, who usually chatted away in
English over the airwaves on the assumption that he was being

monitored, operating on his regular beat. She heard him shot down in
ﬂames by a ﬂight of Spitﬁres and regarded herself in part as ‘his
executioner’:
He was unable to get out and we listened to him as he screamed
and screamed for his mother and cursed the Fuehrer. I found
myself praying: ‘Get out, bale out – oh, please dear God, get him
out.’ But it was no use, he could not make it. We heard him the
whole way down until he fell below reception range. I went
outside and was sick.132
Meanwhile, workplace relations between servicewomen and their
female ofﬁcers in the women’s forces could be variable.133 Wendy
Ferguson of the WRNS recounted that ‘some women made marvellous
ofﬁcers, but others thought they were the Queen!’134 In similar fashion,
Amy O’Connor of the ATS recorded that ‘some of the women ofﬁcers
were good and some weren’t. I think they were always frightened of
losing their dignity . . . it always seemed to me as if they daren’t let go’.135
In the WAAF, the ‘administrative’ (or ‘G’) ofﬁcers oversaw the ‘wellbeing’ of airwomen on RAF stations and they were described as ‘the
backbone of the service’:
Their days were ﬁlled with endless pettifogging details, lists and
charts and records, visits to working sites, to quarters, trips
down to Equipment, to see about so-and-so for the women . . .
Evenings and weekends would be just as busy, with classes for
one thing or another, sessions of ‘non-specialist training’, discussion groups, entertainments, games and matches.136
Yet there was social class antagonism towards them on the part of some
airwomen. ‘Such ofﬁcers were chosen not for speciﬁc skills,’ opined
Mary Lee Settle, ‘but for a mystic hangover from a distant peacetime –
a quality called Ofﬁcer-material, which usually meant that one’s voice
was careful, one’s bearing “genteel”, that one was, at least in form,
a “lady”.’137 Others in the WAAF remarked on the high-handedness
that could accompany the granting of commissioned rank. Madeau
Stewart maintained that ‘On the whole women ofﬁcers were tolerable.
But it has to be said that some women who acquire power over other
women become tyrannical and, in the end, absurd.’138
There were, moreover, ﬁssures within the female ofﬁcer corps.
Constance Woodhead reported that there was a rift between the WAAF

8:

87 / Performance
‘administrative’ ofﬁcers and the WAAF ‘substitution’ ofﬁcers (who
directly replaced RAF ofﬁcers in specialist technical roles and were
thus less inclined to concern themselves with the administration of airwomen) since the latter regarded themselves as ‘making a bigger contribution to the war effort than any administrative ofﬁcer could possibly
be doing’.139 There were also, according to WAAF ofﬁcer Muriel Gane
Pushman, generational divides:
Most of the women in the higher echelons of command were
older. Many were spinsters who had found in the war something
which at last gave purpose to their lives. To me it seemed their
own position, and the general pecking order was so important to
them that a plethora of petty jealousies frequently distorted their
judgement. There seemed to be resentment against young ofﬁcers
coming up, particularly if they happened to be pretty. It was as
though they regarded the privileges of rank almost as compensation for having missed out in other directions. On this basis, they
could, I suppose, have seen it as somehow unfair that girls who
already had the advantages of youth and good looks should also
receive ofﬁcer status. Yet it was true that the only sort of girl this
type of ofﬁcer seemed to be able to tolerate was either the
bespectacled little mouse or the strident anti-man feminist.140
David Morgan and Mary Evans have suggested that the military caste
system prohibited gender solidarity across the ranks in the women’s
forces: ‘What female ofﬁcers did not encourage was any sense of solidarity amongst women.’141

Performance
During the course of the war, there were many acts of bravery
performed by female personnel. Among them, WAAF telephone operator, Elspeth Henderson, was awarded the Military Medal for her ‘courage and example of a high order’ after the operations’ room in which she
was working at RAF Biggin Hill received a direct hit during an air raid in
1940. Despite being knocked over in the blast, she continued to maintain contact with Fighter Command headquarters until the building
caught ﬁre and she was ordered to leave through a broken window.142
WRNS despatch rider, Pamela McGeorge, received the British Empire
Medal (BEM) for her ‘great gallantry and complete disregard of danger’

8:

whilst delivering urgent despatches to the naval commander-in-chief in
Plymouth in the midst of an air raid in 1941. An explosion blew her off
her motorcycle and damaged the machine beyond repair, but she ran
half-a-mile through the falling bombs to deliver the documents to
Admiralty House before volunteering to go out again into the
maelstrom.143 ATS ‘gunner’, Grace Golland, earned the BEM for her
‘courageous behaviour in danger and complete and unsparing devotion
to duty’ on a gun site during a raid in 1944. Engulfed in smoke and
ﬂames from ﬁfty incendiary bombs that landed nearby, she ensured her
predictor team remained in action and through her coolness enabled the
guns to carry on ﬁring at enemy aircraft for nearly an hour.144
There were also examples of exceptional skill and intuition. In
illustration of this, WAAF photographic interpreter, Constance
Babington Smith, is credited with making the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of
a German V-1 ﬂying bomb at Peenemünde in late 1943. As head of the
section at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit at RAF Medmenham,
which was responsible for the interpretation of aerial reconnaissance
photographs of enemy aircraft and aircraft factories, she and her team
were briefed to look out for ‘anything queer’ at this German experimental
facility on the Baltic coast and, whilst pouring over a poor-quality image
taken by the pilot of a RAF Mosquito, spotted a ramp holding a small
cruciform shape at the lower end of inclined rails. This eagle-eyed discovery, combined with the examination of other photographs of possible
launch sites and storage facilities in France, indicated that a ﬂying bomb
attack from across the Channel was imminent. As a result, the allied air
forces demolished these sites under Operation Crossbow.145 She was
later described as ‘the outstanding Allied authority on the interpretation
of photographs of aircraft’.146
Servicewomen came to play an important role in the secret war.
As the Battle of the Atlantic intensiﬁed, a team of WRNS ofﬁcers and
ratings, for instance, helped to design and play out anti-submarine war
games with the naval ofﬁcers of escort groups at the Royal Navy’s
Western Approaches Tactical Unit in Liverpool.147 One of the Navy’s
leading U-boat hunters recalled that ‘These girls became so experienced
in the tactics of convoy battle that they were able to save many a saltcrusted sea-dog from making the errors which would inevitably lead to
disaster to their convoys of model ships.’148 Female personnel were also
well represented at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, the wartime
home of the Government Code and Cypher School, which penetrated

the signal communications of the Axis powers. Some 2,600 members of
the WRNS, 1,100 of the WAAF and 400 of the ATS came to be based at
Bletchley and various outstations,149 and they were employed in a variety
of duties related to the cracking of the enemy codes. These included
operating the ‘bombes’, electro-mechanical machines used by cryptologists to help decipher messages sent from the German enigma machines,
which incorporated a series of rotating drums and plug boards to replicate the workings of enigma. The job involved painstakingly adjusting
the bombes’ settings in line with carefully worked out ‘menus’, provided
by the code breakers, in order to turn encrypted messages into ‘plain’
text. One such Wren bombe operator, Diana Payne, recounted that this
‘soul-destroying’ work entailed long and varying shift patterns, noisy
conditions, great meticulousness and considerable psychological strain:
All the Wrens took the job very seriously, and we felt the weight
of responsibility that any mistake or time wasted could mean
lives lost. An example of this tension was when I took a Wren
out to visit some relatives. In the middle of tea she turned white
and left the room, taking me with her. She thought she had
made an error whilst on duty. We worked it out on paper and
decided all was well. Panic followed while we wondered how to
dispose of the secret piece of paper, which we burnt in a tiny
bowl in the kitchen. My cousins, alarmed by the smell, thought
we had gone quite mad.150
‘To keep our morale up,’ Payne continued, ‘we were told that Winston
Churchill was constantly on the line to his “most secret source”, and that
our work was absolutely vital.’151 But over time the strain began to tell:
Many of us developed digestive troubles with the constant
change of hours. My friend collapsed unconscious, suffering
from overstrain, and was invalided out of the Service. Another
had nightmares, and woke up one night clutching a phantom
drum. There were cases of girls going berserk on duty.152
These pressures were compounded by the fact that they were unable to
disclose to anyone – not even to close family – the nature of the duties
they were undertaking:
We had no category badges, and were supposed to say, if asked,
that we were just ‘Writers’ [clerks]. Sometimes it was very difﬁcult

having so little to say about one’s life, and this explanation did not
always satisfy relatives and friends, so my wartime activities were
considered unimportant and something of a failure.153
It was not until the 1970s, following the publication of Frederick
Winterbotham’s The Ultra Secret,154 that the key wartime role of
Bletchley Park, and those who worked there, began to emerge.
Although the more senior positions in the establishment were dominated by men,155 it has been said that servicewomen, along with their
civilian female colleagues, made up ‘the back-bone of Bletchley’s codebreaking organisation’.156 Such secretive work, together with the many
other highly-conﬁdential wartime duties that women in the forces came
to perform, was credited with helping to explode certain long-standing
gender myths. Vera Laughton Mathews commented that one of these
was that “‘Women can’t keep a secret!” Well, the war has shown
beyond any doubt that they can keep secrets.’157
But what of the ordinary rank and ﬁle? Early in 1945, the three
service departments were asked by the Royal Commission on Equal Pay
to assess the quality of women’s work in the forces compared to that of
the men. The Admiralty reported that on the basis of a like-for-like
comparison in terms of educational background and general intelligence,
the ‘WRNS personnel are at least the equal of, and are frequently superior
to, RN personnel in jobs which require manual dexterity, neatness or
accuracy’. It was, however, recorded that ‘outside this ﬁeld, with a few
exceptions, their efﬁciency is estimated to be less than that of men by up
to as much as 25%’. According to the naval authorities:
The general inferiority attributed to women is ascribed to
a variety of causes such as lack of physical strength and inability
to stand up to so much prolonged strain, notably on
watchkeeping . . . ; inferior mechanical aptitude, except in simple processes; lower capacity for the application of knowledge
to practical use; inclination to get ﬂustered in emergency and
more easily discouraged when up against difﬁculties; lack of
capacity for improvisation; unwillingness to accept responsibility and inability to exercise authority.158
The War Ofﬁce evaluation was similar in tone. Its assessment was that
‘the work of women is equal to, or better than, that of men’ in functions
‘where routine manipulative skill is required’ and ‘where routine detail

90::

91 / Performance
and repetitive work is involved’. But it was stated that ‘the percentage of
men who are capable of reaching a high standard is considerably greater
than the percentage of women, due particularly to lack of ambition, lack
of willingness to accept responsibility, lack of background and lack of
experience on the part of the women.’ As for the auxiliaries who helped
to man the guns in the mixed AA batteries:
Women employed as instrument numbers, operators, ﬁre control,
and plotters compare very favourably in these duties with men.
But in camp duties and fatigues they are generally unsuitable,
particularly where physical strength is required. Generally speaking, women are found easier to train, absorb knowledge more
quickly and tend to show more initial enthusiasm than men; but
men on similar duties maintain a higher rate of efﬁciency over
a long period and are less likely to lose enthusiasm.159
The Air Ministry response echoed that of the other services. Its view was
that ‘in work of a routine or sedentary nature women produce better work
than men; it is more accurate and interest in it is sustained for longer periods
than in the case of men’. Yet it was noted that ‘for work requiring the
exercise of initiative, responsibility and drive, men produce the better
work’, and that ‘men are generally superior to women in the ranks of
sergeant and above’.160 Among the individual categories of work assessed,
WAAF telephonists, general duties clerks and waitresses were said to be
‘superior to men’; radar operators, wireless operators and high-speed telegraphists ‘equal to men’; and balloon operators, armament assistants and
motor transport mechanics ‘not equal to men’. Air frame ﬁtters, instrument
repairers and electricians were considered to be ‘equal to men on routine
repetition work [but] inferior to men in fault ﬁnding improvisation, handling strange equipment, initiative in over-coming difﬁculties, and in heavy
work in aircraft’. In similar terms, ﬂight mechanics were ‘equal to men on
repetition work but not equal in work requiring detailed mechanical
knowledge or improvisation’.161
Such gender-laden judgements did not, however, go unchallenged. The DWAAF, Lady Mary Welsh, the wife of the recent head of
the RAF delegation in Washington, who had taken over from Trefusis
Forbes in the autumn of 1943,162 was asked to comment on a draft of the
Air Ministry’s submission and thought it was ‘a little discouraging’ and
‘likely to give a misleading impression’. She believed that it did not take
sufﬁcient account of such factors as the rapid expansion of the WAAF,

the relative youth of its personnel compared to that of the RAF (in 1945,
70 per cent of airwomen were twenty-ﬁve or under, but only 45 per cent
of airmen) and their limited training experiences in civilian life. In relation
to the assertion that the work of airwomen could only compare to airmen
in the lower ranks, she contended that the senior NCOs among the RAF
ground staff were still mainly regulars and ‘there is a natural prejudice on
the part of these men against admitting women and helping to train them
to take these higher posts’.163 There were also some unease in male circles
about the generalisations made in the submission. The Permanent UnderSecretary of State for Air, Sir Arthur Street, remarked that
I cannot help feeling that here we stray inevitably from solid
facts to the realm of conjecture and opinion. In matters such as
these on which there is controversy between feminists and antifeminists, it is only too easy to be prejudiced or to give the
appearance of being prejudiced.164
Despite these concerns, the RAF authorities lodged their appraisal with
the royal commission and DWAAF’s views were not incorporated in the
ﬁnal document. On ﬁnding out, she registered a ‘strong protest’.165

5 STATUS AND DISCIPLINE
Change in Status for the ATS and WAAF
At the start of the war, members of the ATS, WAAF and WRNS
were still technically civilians. They were enrolled under a form of
contract to their respective auxiliary services, rather than being enlisted
or commissioned into the armed forces and were not subject to the full
panoply of military law, as incorporated in the Army Act, Air Force Act
or the Naval Discipline Act. The penalties that could be meted out by
women ofﬁcers to their subordinates were limited to such minor punishments as extra duties, stoppages of leave, restrictions of privileges and
‘admonition’.1 When it was suggested in the War Ofﬁce that on the
outbreak of hostilities ATS personnel might be designated as members
of the armed forces and brought more extensively under the Army Act,
such a step was ﬁrmly opposed by the army authorities: ‘there are no
grounds on which we should be justiﬁed in taking the revolutionary step
of giving women the status of ofﬁcers and soldiers’.2 They remained in
effect ‘camp followers’.3
By the spring of 1940, it had become apparent that modiﬁcations needed to be made to the disciplinary code of the women’s services.
First and foremost, there was no legal sanction to prevent women
leaving the forces if they wished to do so. As a result, some of them
simply walked out from their posts as the mood took them. This caused
considerable disruption to the work of their units and represented
a lamentable waste of training resources. There were also concerns

94 / Status and Discipline
about the threat to the country’s security since a number had access to
secret military information. General Pile’s personal ATS clerk, for
example, up sticks and left one day, taking with her a shorthand notebook full of the AA chief’s conﬁdential correspondence. Between
January and May 1940, some 2,500 members of the ATS were discharged, which equated to a loss of about 10 per cent of the total
strength of the service over these months and a signiﬁcant proportion
of these cases were in effect ‘walkings out’.4
In addition to this, female ofﬁcers had difﬁculties in controlling
the more delinquent women who remained. Not only did these ofﬁcers
occupy their positions on a courtesy basis, and thus could not strictly
issue lawful commands, but also the scale of punishments was regarded
as inadequate to deal with more serious offences and dismissal was
obviously not a sanction that could be widely used in wartime.5 One
WAAF ofﬁcer, Barbara Whittingham-Jones, commented that ‘the triviality of allowable punishment of WAAF personnel tends to expose the
whole fabric of WAAF discipline to ridicule in the eyes of the male
personnel’.6 Furthermore, if discipline cases were referred to male commanding ofﬁcers, they sometimes found it difﬁcult to follow the same
procedures for servicewomen that applied to the men. ‘I had to point
out’, recalled Felicity Peake, now ofﬁcer in command of the WAAF
section at Biggin Hill, ‘that it did not help discipline, or please the airmen
if an airwoman, who was marched in before the CO on a charge, was
invited by him to be seated and offered a cigarette!’7
In the summer of 1940, the three service departments jointly
approached the War Cabinet’s Home Policy committee with a view to
resolving some of these disciplinary issues. In view of the recent
Emergency Powers (Defence) Act of 1940, which permitted the issuing
of defence regulations requiring persons to place their services at the
disposal of the King, and of Defence Regulation 29B, which compelled
police constables and ﬁremen to remain in their posts, it was proposed
that a similar regulation should be issued obliging members of the
women’s forces to continue to serve unless released by the relevant
authorities. Contraventions would be punishable by the civil courts
with ﬁnes of up to £100, or three months imprisonment. It was further
suggested that women ofﬁcers be given the power to dock pay for
‘absence without leave’; ‘refusal or neglect to perform duties’; and
‘loss or destruction of, or damage to, ofﬁcial property’. These deductions would not exceed £1 for each offence.8

95 / Change in Status for the ATS and WAAF
The Home Policy committee was doubtful about the proposals.
There was a general feeling that it would be difﬁcult to persuade parliament to support a regulation that made female ‘deserters’ liable to trial
by a civil court – with all the stigma attached to an ordinary criminal
charge and the likelihood of widely divergent verdicts depending on the
outlook of different civilian justices – when their male counterparts
were tried by a military court martial. It was thus recommended that
the service departments explore whether the women’s forces could be
brought more fully under military law in order ‘to avoid differentiation
of treatment in this respect as between men and women serving in the
Forces’.9
After several months of contemplation, the War Ofﬁce came to
the conclusion that its ATS personnel should become members of the
armed forces and appropriate sections of the Army Act extended to
them accordingly. This was thought necessary in order to strengthen the
hand of women ofﬁcers in matters of discipline and help reduce the
‘desertion’ rate. It was also hoped that such a recategorisation would
increase the prestige of the ATS and encourage greater levels of recruitment. What brought matters to a head, however, was the recommendation of the Joubert committee that women should be employed
operationally in AA Command. If members of the ATS were to man
the ﬁre control instruments on gun sites then it was imperative that they
should not be permitted to leave the service at will. What was more, the
position of the women’s forces in relation to the Hague Rules on the
laws and customs of war was not entirely clear. If the country was
overrun by an invading force, and ATS women were found to be undertaking ‘practically combatant duties’ with the gun batteries, it was
contended that as civilians ‘they become liable to be shot if taken
prisoner’.10
In the spring of 1941, the army authorities approached the War
Cabinet with a view to giving the ATS fuller military status. It consented
to this and gave the other service departments the opportunity to opt in.
The Air Ministry agreed to do so, but the Admiralty declined.11 On
25 April, the Defence (Women’s Forces) Regulations were promulgated.
Under these, all women enrolled in the ATS and WAAF, whether their
enrolment dated from before or after the making of these regulations,
were declared to be ‘members of the armed forces of the Crown’ and the
Army Act and Air Force Act applied to them by the Army Council and
Air Council ‘to such extent and subject to such adaptations and

96 / Status and Discipline
modiﬁcations as may be speciﬁed’.12 The DATS at the time, Helen
Gwynne-Vaughan, regarded these reforms as entirely appropriate for
the new generation of women who were ‘accustomed to be on level
terms with men’ and likened them to entering her ‘promised land’.13
In the wake of the ‘militarisation’ of the ATS and WAAF,
their female ofﬁcers were granted the king’s commission. Although
they maintained different rank titles – an ATS ‘second subaltern’, for
example, was the equivalent of an army ‘second lieutenant’, and
a WAAF ‘squadron ofﬁcer’ that of a RAF ‘squadron leader’ – the
badges of rank were the same as those worn by male ofﬁcers of
equal status.14 Furthermore, in certain circumstances, these women
ofﬁcers were authorised to issue orders to soldiers and airmen. In the
ATS regulations, it was stated that ‘when they are normally
employed on those duties for which they have been detailed to
serve with troops, ofﬁcers of the ATS have power of command
over such military ofﬁcers and soldiers as may be specially placed
under their orders from time to time by any superior military
authority’.15 Likewise, an Air Ministry Order conﬁrmed that
‘Ofﬁcers and airmen of the Royal Air Force may be placed under
the orders of ofﬁcers or non-commissioned ofﬁcers of the Women’s
Auxiliary Air Force if of higher relative rank’.16 Jenny Nicholson
recorded, however, that there was some institutional reticence to
acknowledge this subversion of gender roles:
There was an inclination to shy at admitting that men were ever
put in the position of having to take orders from women. But
they often were. In the RAF, towards the end of 1943, I ran
across a WAAF ofﬁcer with RAF ofﬁcers serving under her in
undeniable command of a small RAF formation.17
Decisions were also made as to which disciplinary sections of the relevant service acts should be applied to the women’s forces. The ATS
became subject to sections 15 and 40 of the Army Act. These dealt with
such offences as ‘absence from duty without leave’ and ‘conduct to the
prejudice of good order and discipline’. The WAAF was covered by
sections 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 24, 28, 39A and 40 of the Air Force Act. These
included the same offences that applied to the ATS, but also incorporated such transgressions as ‘injury to equipment’ and ‘damage to aircraft’. As for the scale of penalties for female other ranks, designated
ATS and WAAF ofﬁcers, as well as RAF commanding ofﬁcers or army

area or district commanders, could impose summary punishments such
as admonition, extra duties, conﬁnement to camp for up to fourteen
days, or forfeiture of pay for the same period. Other ranks could be tried
by court-martial, but it was only possible to remand them for trial if they
so elected and the only additional sanction available to such a tribunal
was the forfeiture of twenty-eight, rather than fourteen, days pay.
Sterner punishments such as detention could not be imposed.18
Some doubts, however, emerged as to the position of servicewomen overseas. It was apparent that the Defence (Women’s Forces)
Regulations did not legally extend to all places outside the United
Kingdom and that in some parts of the world members of the women’s
forces could only be dealt with under military law as ‘camp followers’.
In order to clarify matters, an amendment was made to the Army and
Air Force Acts in 1943 which ensured that those disciplinary sections of
the acts already applied at home by the Army and Air Councils could be
given effect abroad.19

The Exclusion of the WRNS
The Admiralty had put its name to the interdepartmental submission to the Home Policy committee in 1940. Although it regarded
the disciplinary problem as largely an issue for the ATS and the WAAF –
‘the WRNS’, commented the Head of the Civil Establishment Branch,
‘seem to get along all right by a combination of good ofﬁcers, esprit de
corps, and bluff’20 – there was a willingness to go along with the War
Ofﬁce and the Air Ministry on this occasion for the sake of uniformity.21
But the question of making Wrens members of the armed forces and
extending the Naval Discipline Act to women was a much more contentious issue for the naval authorities.
Vera Laughton Mathews was ﬁrmly in favour of the WRNS
coming into line with the other women’s services on this question. She
contended that it was undesirable for highly trained Wrens, or those
engaged in secret work, to be able to ‘resign at will’ from their posts; that
a number of the duties they carried out could be regarded as coming
within the ‘combatant sphere’; and that as female personnel worked side
by side with naval ratings so they should be subject to the same punishment for similar offences. Indeed, she believed that the prestige attached
to such a change of status would give a welcome boost to her service: ‘To
be recognised as part of the Navy will certainly be good for morale and

8:

90::

98 / Status and Discipline
esprit de corps and will therefore ensure a higher standard of
efﬁciency.’22
The Admiralty consulted the naval commanders-in-chief at
home over what it termed this ‘revolutionary’ change and they were
hostile to any such reform. ‘This is not the proper place to enter into
biological or psychological reﬂections on the varying capacities and
capabilities of the two sexes’, contended the Commander-in-Chief,
Portsmouth, Admiral Sir William James. ‘[But] we should never forget
that women are women and that Acts of Parliament designed many
years ago for the purpose of controlling men combatants cannot be
suitably applied to women engaged in modern warfare.’23 In the light
of the opposition, the naval authorities decided this was not a path they
wished to pursue. It was pointed out that the ‘desertion’ rate in the
WRNS was very low, amounting to thirty-seven cases out of a force of
some 11,000 between December 1940 and March 1941 and therefore
its disciplinary record did not necessitate such a step. It was further
noted that the legal advice obtained by the Admiralty indicated that if
Wrens undertook combatant roles they were fully protected under
international law by the Hague Rules and the Geneva Convention. It
was calculated, moreover, that there would be particular problems in
applying naval law to the WRNS since nearly half of its personnel were
living in their own homes as ‘immobiles’ and thus outside the control of
the service unless they were on duty.24 Underpinning this was
a reluctance on the part of the Royal Navy hierarchy to see young
women paraded in front of a naval court. According to Laughton
Mathews:
The shadow of the court-martial loomed large in the minds of
the tender-hearted naval ofﬁcers who shrank from the painful
thought of a little Wren in the dock, though women pass
through the civil courts every day despised and degraded, with
never a sigh nor a thought from the gold-braided.25
Although an Admiralty Fleet Order in 1942 recognised that, in certain
situations, naval ratings could be required to work under the direction
of WRNS ofﬁcers or higher ratings – Laughton Mathews related examples of male ratings training as parachute packers under leading Wrens,
while other ratings in the accountant branch worked in pay ofﬁces
under WRNS ofﬁcers – members of the WRNS remained technically
civilians and were not subject to the Naval Discipline Act.26

99 / Ongoing Disciplinary Issues for the ATS and WAAF

Ongoing Disciplinary Issues for the ATS and WAAF
Despite the change of status for the WAAF and ATS, there
continued to be concerns over their disciplinary codes. The Air
Ministry, for example, soon received representations from RAF home
commands and groups about the shortcomings of the new WAAF
regulations. Not only did the stipulation that prevented other ranks
from being tried by court martial without their consent mean that
recourse to such a tribunal was virtually impossible, but also the penalties available were deemed ineffective in dealing with recalcitrant airwomen. Those awarded extra duties sometimes refused to perform
them; conﬁnement to camp was difﬁcult to enforce on those who were
determined to break out or those living in billets outside a base; and
forfeiture of pay made little difference to those who were not dependent
on this source of income. These problems were compounded by the
arrival of a number of female ‘conscripts’ who found it difﬁcult to adapt
to service discipline, as well as the reluctance of the civil courts to deal
with military offences. A recommendation for discharge was often the
only option.27 ‘The scale of punishments at present authorised’, complained the Air Ofﬁcer Commanding No. 24 Group, ‘is entirely inadequate either for punitive or for deterrent purposes.’28
The disciplinary challenges that confronted some WAAF ofﬁcers were vividly illustrated in a report submitted to the commanding
ofﬁcer of RAF Tangmere on 27 May 1942 by Flight Ofﬁcer Whittome,
the ofﬁcer in charge of the WAAF section. In her report she described the
antics of one of her airwomen:
ACW [Aircraftwoman] Silvie arrived at Westerton Camp
Orderley Room at approximately 22.25 hours on the 26th
instant. She came in shouting, waving her arms about and
walking round and round calling out ‘The bloody Richmond
Arms is closed’. The duty Corporal and Sgt. Cooper (Admin)
endeavoured to persuade her to go to her room and to bed. This
she refused to do. She burst into the Cooks’ Room, where many
of them were sleeping, shouting at the top of her voice. She ﬂung
out of their room and into the Boiler Room, pulling down all the
soiled sheets which were stacked ready for the laundry, and
threw them all on the ﬂoor; as fast as NCOs picked them up
she pulled them down again. She endeavoured to throw an

100 / Status and Discipline
airwoman’s overcoat, which was hanging up to dry, into the
Boiler, but was prevented by Sgt. Cooper. She then emptied
a coke bucket all over the ﬂoor, threw paper and any odd article
she could ﬁnd across the room, then made for the Salvage bin
which Sgt. Cooper was standing in front of. She remarked ‘I
don’t want to ﬁght you because you’ve got three bloody stripes,
but I’m going to empty that bin.’ And empty it she did. After this
she went into the Nissen hut, where a number of girls were
sleeping, shouting and screaming. She emptied a vase of ﬂowers
on to the ﬂoor, then rushed back to the Ofﬁcer’s ofﬁce, where
she stripped the Notice Board of some dozen or more notices,
emptied the ofﬁcer’s desk, drawers and cupboards, emptied ﬁles
full of DROs and PORs and other documents on to the ﬂoor.
Next she went into the Telephonists’ bedroom and by now had
wakened and disturbed nearly ﬁfty airwomen.
The redoubtable Silvie was eventually put to bed with the assistance of
two male RAF police corporals, but the frustrations of Whittome were
plain:
We have . . . had nearly six months of these periodical outbursts
and outrageous scenes, and I feel the NCOs think that I am
letting them down in allowing an airwoman so obviously unsuitable for the Service to remain in the unit, and in asking them to
cope again and again with these hysterical and nerve-wracking
episodes.
Silvie has a shocking inﬂuence in many ways in the unit. The
timid girls and some of the NCOs are terriﬁed of her and think
that she can do anything she likes without being punished,
simply because were she charged for offences as other girls
are, she would never be off a charge – the difﬁcult girls rejoice
in her exhibitionist acts and praise her for her courage in standing up against authority . . ..
I would like to stress the harm this girl is doing and has done
to the WAAF both inside and outside the Service.29
Air Chief Marshal Sir Philip Joubert shared the disciplinary concerns.
He opined that at the outset of the war ‘the WAAF were mostly of a type
that had a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for their work’ but
when conscription was applied ‘the picture changed in a radical

manner’. Whilst visiting RAF stations as Inspector General in 1943, he
deplored the presence of what he termed ‘Borstal girls, trollops and
thieves amongst a mass of decent women’ and lamented that ‘the
women ofﬁcers did their best, but not many of them had the training
and none the authority that would have helped them to control their
unruly ﬂock’. What complicated matters, he added, was that the Judge
Advocate General, Sir Henry MacGeagh, had ‘thrown a very large
spanner in the works’ by maintaining the narrow legal opinion that
the Air Force Act could not be held to apply, from a disciplinary point of
view, to airwomen.30 MacGeagh’s view was that women, through their
gender, were technically disqualiﬁed from becoming members of the air
force through the Air Force (Constitution) Act of 1917 and the Sex
Disqualiﬁcation Act of 1919.31 ‘This’, observed Joubert, ‘threw the

102 / Status and Discipline
whole system of punishment for bad behaviour into complete
confusion.’32
The ATS faced many of the same disciplinary dilemmas as the
WAAF. Julia Cowper, author of the War Ofﬁce’s internal history of
the ATS, highlighted in particular the trouble it had in controlling its
more incorrigible miscreants when no custodial punishments were
available:
ATS unit commanders used many devices to hold their defaulters, but they escaped from camps and barracks clothed in shirts
and knickers and without their shoes; they squeezed through
lavatory windows which appeared small enough to preclude the
passage of anything bigger than a cat; they scaled walls and
dodged guards. Those who preferred to remain with their units
where they were housed, fed and paid, were sometimes greater
problems than those who escaped. They destroyed beds and
black-outs and any other Government property on which they
could lay their hands, refused to obey orders and were subversive to the discipline of the whole unit. Three recruits made
history when, amongst other exploits, and clad only in pyjamas,
they mobbed a male RSM [Regimental Sergeant Major] on
parade, after which they were, contrary to all orders, placed
under lock and key. Authority was obtained for their discharge
that afternoon but not before they had torn down the walls
separating the three cells, partitions which had proved strong
enough to restrain generations of male offenders.33
To try and mitigate the position in the WAAF, various RAF commanders pressed the Air Ministry to introduce some form of military detention for habitual offenders.34 It was, however, reluctant to do this on the
grounds that this would entail the setting up of an extensive network of
WAAF detention barracks staffed by female guards and informed the
lobbyists that, in its view, the existing scale of penalties was adequate:
The [Air] Council consider that the discipline of the WAAF
should, in general, be based upon inculcating in the individual
the desire to do the right thing in the right way, rather than upon
the threat and fear of punishment. They consider that tactful
and sympathetic handling of recalcitrant airwomen should do

much to avoid difﬁculty and to foster in them the growth of
a correct attitude of mind.35
Meanwhile, over the summer of 1942, the Markham committee was
looking into this matter as part of its inquiry into amenities and welfare
conditions in the three women’s services and on the basis of complaints
it received from female ofﬁcers recommended that ‘further disciplinary
powers are required’.36 In the light of this, the Air Ministry revisited the
issue and, with the support of Jane Trefusis Forbes, devised a series of
proposed amendments to the WAAF code of discipline. These included
the stipulations that other ranks should be remanded for trial by court
martial without their consent and that this tribunal be permitted to
award a sentence of conﬁnement to camp for up to twenty-eight days,
with or without forfeiture of pay for the same period. Furthermore, it
was suggested that a court martial should have the power to award
sentences of up to six months imprisonment in a civil prison for offences
such as stealing from other airwomen or repeated absences without
leave.37
In order for the Air Ministry to proceed with these modiﬁcations, the War Ofﬁce needed to adjust ATS regulations along corresponding lines if, as the Markham committee wished, the women’s
services were to remain in step. In the summer of 1943, the executive
committee of the Army Council approved in principle similar changes to
the ATS code of discipline.38 But the Secretary of State for War, now Sir
James Grigg, vetoed these modiﬁcations. He remained unconvinced that
there was any compelling need to introduce a more draconian scale of
punishments and was particularly opposed to the prospect of locking up
servicewomen in civil prisons, with all the stigma that this entailed,
while their male counterparts served their sentences in military detention barracks. This, Grigg believed, would give rise to ‘political
controversy’.39 ‘I am quite ready to face a row if there is real need for
it,’ he stated, ‘but in the present case I am not convinced that there is.’40
The proposed amendments to the ATS disciplinary regulations were
thus dropped.
Grigg’s intransigence put the Air Ministry in a quandry.41 Its
ﬁrst inclination was to forge ahead with its suggested revisions to the
WAAF code of discipline. This was justiﬁed on the grounds that both
RAF and WAAF opinion was strongly in favour of stiffer penalties; that
ﬂagrant disciplinary lapses by airwomen which went inadequately

punished were said to have an especially demoralising effect on RAF
personnel – a state of affairs which did not apply to the same extent in
the army and Royal Navy as the ATS and WRNS were not so closely
assimilated with their ‘parent’ services; and that civilian women
employed in factories under the Essential Works Order of 1941 could
be imprisoned for certain misdemeanours, such as habitual absenteeism,
for up to three months.42 However, the concerns of the new DWAAF,
Mary Welsh, and a number of RAF commanders, about the stigmatisation of airwomen sent to civil prisons, as well as their uneasiness over the
principle of handing offenders over to the civil power for service
offences, persuaded the Air Ministry to look again at the idea of introducing some form of military detention.43 At the end of 1943, the advice
of Violet Markham was sought on the matter and it was recommended
that WAAF ‘detention huts’ should be set up at selected RAF stations
where offenders could be sent summarily by their commanding ofﬁcers
for between fourteen and twenty-eight days, or by a court martial for
periods up to forty-two days. These detention facilities, it was

envisaged, would provide ‘corrective training’ that would ‘aim at capturing the airwoman as an individual and awakening her to a proper
sense of self respect and pride in the WAAF’.44
In the spring of 1944, the Air Council withdrew the right of
WAAF other ranks to refuse to be tried by court martial and empowered
this tribunal to award a sentence of conﬁnement to camp for up to
twenty-eight days, in addition to forfeiture of pay for the same period.
It also agreed in principle to the introduction of detention.45 A factﬁnding visit was subsequently paid by Air Ministry ofﬁcials to Fort
Darland military detention barracks at Chatham and a set of draft
regulations for WAAF detention rooms drawn up in consultation with
Molly Mellanby, a women’s prison commissioner and former governor
of Aylesbury Borstal.46 In devising these rules, it was recognised that
powers had to be available to control those in detention who were not
amenable to normal codes of behaviour; otherwise the Air Ministry
might be placed in the invidious position of having to release detainees
prematurely because it had no authority to subdue them – a predicament
that would ‘bring ridicule on the scheme’. As a result, the regulations
included the right to restrain a violent airwoman by placing her temporarily in solitary conﬁnement and removing all of her personal
possessions.47
Welsh, however, objected to these procedures. Although she had
been party to the decision to recommend detention, she anticipated ‘the
most lenient form’ and the rules ‘went a good deal further than she had
envisaged or was now prepared to approve’. She had thus come to the
view that the introduction of detention at this late point in the war would
evoke public criticism and give the erroneous impression that the WAAF
was an undisciplined force which required stronger disciplinary measures
than the other women’s services.48 ‘The fact that DWAAF now feels that
she cannot support a scheme for detention for airwomen’, minuted one
Air Ministry ofﬁcial, ‘has rather thrown us back on our heels.’49
In the summer of 1944, the matter was reconsidered by the Air
Council.50 There was some frustration over the change of heart. ‘At the
earlier stage’, observed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir
Charles Portal, ‘the criticism had been that there was too little deterrent
effect. Now we are running away from detention because there might be
criticism that it was too harsh.’51 He was in favour of pressing ahead on
the grounds that the absence of this punishment was by all accounts ‘a
real handicap to successful WAAF administration’ and the Air Ministry

was ‘only seeking to apply to the WAAF the same rules as were applied
to airmen’. Yet the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair,
took a more cautious line. He noted that the service had managed to get
by without detention since the beginning of the war and was of the
opinion that to institute it now ‘would give rise to a great deal of
parliamentary and public criticism’ and ‘react adversely on the prestige
of the WAAF’, especially since there was little prospect of Sir James
Grigg agreeing to extend it to the ATS. He thus recommended it should
not be pursued at this time; a decision supported by the WAAF
hierarchy.52 Although there was some discussion of alternatives over
the following months, such as the possibility of longer sentences of
conﬁnement to camp being served at specially selected RAF stations
where the exits were carefully controlled, no further wartime changes
were made to the WAAF code of discipline.53 During the ﬁnal period of
the conﬂict, it was estimated by Fighter Command that the lack of
a serious deterrent for persistent absentees resulted in nearly double
the number of airwomen to airmen being absent without leave from its
bases.54 Constance Woodhead concluded that the WAAF disciplinary
code was so inadequate that ‘ofﬁcers sometimes felt that they were
running the service mainly by bluff’:
Serious and responsible members of the WAAF always felt that
for the service not be completely subject to the Air Force Act in
the same manner (or as nearly as possible in the same manner)
as the RAF was both illogical and undesirable.55
In the meantime, WAAF ofﬁcers continued to deal with the day-to-day
transgressions of their airwomen as best they could. Felicity Ashbee
recounted the case of Leading Aircraftwoman Watkins who worked in
the cookhouse at RAF Stenigot but had apparently refused to scrub the
ﬂoor properly and then ‘cut up rough’. Charged with insubordination,
she was brought before the RAF commanding ofﬁcer. Propelled into the
room by two WAAF guards, a hatless but turbaned Watkins – she wore
curlers encased in a turban under her WAAF cap – stood deﬁantly in
front of the station commander and Ashbee while the lengthy charge
was read out:
‘Now Watkins,’ said the CO, looking up from the charge sheet.
‘Have you anything to say?’
‘Yessir, I have, Sir!’

‘Well, what is it, Watkins?’
‘It’s my veins, Sir!’
‘Your what?’ said the CO, genuinely startled.
‘Veins, Sir, my veins!’
And with an unexpectedly acrobatic movement, the solid
Watkins heaved one leg up onto the CO’s desk with a crash.
The crash was the greater because cookhouse personnel still
wore old-fashioned, wooden-soled clogs to preserve their feet
from ﬂoors chronically sodden with water or grease.
It was true. The leg in question was a ﬁne specimen of knotted
varicose veins, displayed by an equally dexterous tug to the lisle
stocking and the clog which, had the idea occurred to Watkins,
was a weapon capable of doing quite a bit of damage. But discretion being the better part of valour when the charge was insubordination, the CO merely drew back an inch or two from the
proffered evidence and allowed the culprit to tell her tale in full.
‘I’ve always done my work properly, Sir . . . It’s just these
dratted veins . . . They don’t half draw. My other leg’s just as
bad. I can show you.’
‘All right Watkins, I’ll take your word for it,’ the CO said
hurriedly . . . .
‘Is that all, Watkins?’
‘Yessir.’
‘Right, you may remove the evidence.’
‘Sir?’
‘Put your leg down, Watkins.’
‘Yessir!’
Leg and clog were withdrawn from the table, nearly sweeping
the CO’s wire in-tray off at the same time. I caught it with one
hand and with the other proffered him Watkins’s docs. He
glanced at them, then looked again at the bulging lumpish form . . .
‘Watkins,’ he said.
‘Sir?’
‘I’m going to dismiss this charge, but, now listen carefully.
That cookhouse ﬂoor has got to be spotless . . . and that means
whenever I think to come in and take a look at it.
Understood?’
The unbeautiful, middle-aged face relaxed with a disbelieving
smile. ‘You bet, Sir! Bless you Sir!’56

108 / Status and Discipline

The WRNS Remains Excluded
In the wake of the Markham report, which recommended
that ‘equal disciplinary powers and punishments should obtain for
the three Services’,57 the Admiralty was forced to look again at the
question of Wrens becoming members of the armed forces and the
application of the Naval Discipline Act to them. During the
autumn of 1942, Laughton Mathews took this opportunity to
renew her efforts to bring the WRNS into step with the other
women’s forces. Not only did she continue to argue that it was
wrong for a woman to ‘just walk out of the Service’, often to go to
a better paid job, but also drew attention to a number of developments that had taken place since the spring of 1941, which she
believed should make the naval authorities revise their previous
judgment. These included the great expansion of the WRNS, along
with the fact that over a third of the new recruits each month were
now ‘conscripts’, which threatened the ‘real volunteer spirit’ of her
force; the signiﬁcant increase in the categories of work, a number
of which were connected to the use of lethal weapons; and the
growing number of women serving overseas within appreciable
distance of the front line. Difﬁculties had also arisen at some
bases where small groups of Wrens were required to work under
WAAF ofﬁcers who had no more authority over them than they
had over civilians. It had become apparent, moreover, that because
WRNS personnel were not regarded by the Admiralty as an ‘an
integral part of the Naval Forces’, they were unable to qualify for
some beneﬁts available to other members of the women’s forces,
such as the remission of death duties for those who died of disease
contracted on active service. ‘It would appear’, the Head of Naval
Law was reported by the DWRNS to have remarked, ‘that there is
some advantage in dying a member of the ATS rather than
a member of the WRNS.’58
Laughton Mathews was supported by the Director of
Personal Services at the Admiralty, Rear Admiral Harold Walker.
He agreed that ‘the standard and keenness of recruits is bound to
fall with the increased entries largely drawn from the conscripted
age groups, and as “war weariness” increases’. The psychological
effect of altering the legal basis of the WRNS, he contended, would
be considerable, especially on ‘would-be deserters’, and it would be

109 / The WRNS Remains Excluded
better to act before pressure of circumstances forced the hand of the
naval authorities.59
Other Admiralty ofﬁcials, however, were opposed to any change.
The view was held that there was no real need to alter the disciplinary
basis of the WRNS since the number of ‘deserters’ was still comparatively
small, totalling 158 cases out of an average force of 30,000 during 1942,
and the future ‘walking out’ rate a matter of conjecture. Wrens involved
in combatant duties were considered to be adequately protected under
international law and, given the Defence (Women’s Forces) Regulations
did not extend outside the UK at this time, those stationed abroad were
deemed to be in the same legal position as members of the ATS and
WAAF. Members of the WRNS working under the command of ofﬁcers
from another women’s service, it was observed, were akin to Royal Navy
personnel serving in allied ships and if they offended should be dealt with
by ofﬁcers from their own force. As for any loss of beneﬁts suffered by
Wrens as a result of their different status, it was surmised that this could
be remedied by routine administrative action, rather than by altering the
nature of the service.60
The Admiralty Board considered that the arguments were
evenly balanced and requested the views of the naval commanders-inchief at home.61 The latter maintained that a change of status was
neither necessary nor desirable and pointed in particular to the difﬁculties of applying naval law to ‘immobile’ Wrens who still made up
a quarter of the organisation.62 The Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth,
Admiral Sir Charles Forbes, believed that any alteration to the legal
standing of the WRNS risked demotivating female personnel: ‘I am very
doubtful whether they can be driven with satisfactory results by the
enforcement of a disciplinary code designed for men. The attempt to do
so might well damp that enthusiasm and pride in service to their country
which are the chief motive power behind the Women’s Royal Naval
Service.’63 In the summer of 1943, the Board decided against any
alteration of status.64
The matter was not, however, laid to rest. Early in 1944
Laughton Mathews pressed it again. She reported that the number of
‘desertions’ was increasing, running to 325 cases out of an average force
of 54,000 during 1943, and one of the commonest reasons for ‘walking
out’ was pressure brought to bear on Wrens by husbands who were
themselves in the Royal Navy. ‘Recently’, the DWRNS disclosed, ‘a
Commander RN rang up [the] WRNS Ofﬁcers Appointments Section

8:

110 / Status and Discipline
and announced that his wife, a Third Ofﬁcer, was not returning to duty
and said: “What can you do about it? I know you can do nothing.”’ It
was also contended that new entrants over the past year had brought
about a deterioration in ‘manners and morals’ and that the psychological effect of being under naval discipline would help combat cases of
insubordination. A further consideration was the increasing number of
WRNS ofﬁcers holding technical positions of responsibility and it was
asserted that if these ofﬁcers were ‘legally part of the Navy’, their hands
would be strengthened in dealing with naval personnel working under
them. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, moreover, had now conﬁrmed
that Wrens were not entitled to a remission of death duties due to the
fact that they remained civilians in the eyes of the law and it was feared
that at the end of hostilities Wrens might be refused HM forces’ beneﬁts
on similar grounds.65 The ‘immobile problem’, it was added, was much
reduced due to the fact that only 14 per cent of the WRNS now fell into
this category.66
Concurrently, the naval commanders-in-chief had begun to
have second thoughts on the matter. In the spring of 1944, the
Commander-in-Chief, the Nore, Admiral Sir ‘Jack’ Tovey, who had
taken up this appointment the previous summer, declared that his
views were at variance with those of his predecessor and he was in
favour of bringing the WRNS under the Naval Discipline Act. He
argued that much of the antagonism shown by senior naval ofﬁcers in
his command to a change in status was due to ‘ignorance of altering
circumstances’ and pursued ‘even in obstinate disregard of wellinformed counsel’. He drew particular attention to concerns about
‘mass desertion’ during the demobilisation period, when many Wrens
might want to return to civilian life in advance of their release date, and
to the increasing anxiety of female personnel about the possibility of
being denied post-war beneﬁts.67 Tovey’s opinions were taken on board
by a number of his counterparts. ‘I concur reluctantly’, commented the
Commander-in-Chief, Rosyth, Admiral Sir Wilbraham Ford, ‘that the
time has now arrived to place the WRNS under the Naval Discipline
Act.’68
Admiralty ofﬁcials were not, however, convinced by this
belated groundswell of opinion in favour of reform. Not only was it
pointed out that there would be many legislative complications in
amending the Naval Discipline Act to allow a modiﬁed version of it to
be applied to Wrens, but also that any effective deterrent to desertion

would be impossible without the introduction of detention, which
neither the War Ofﬁce nor Air Ministry had seen ﬁt to adopt. Only
a very few women, it was indicated, were affected by the ineligibility for
death duty concessions and there was no reason to believe that members
of the WRNS would be treated inequitably in any future government
schemes. In the summer of 1944, the naval authorities ruled once more
that there would be no change in status, but an Admiralty Fleet Order
was issued warning naval ofﬁcers that encouraging their WRNS spouses
to desert was ‘a most objectionable and reprehensible dereliction of
duty’.69
For Laughton Mathews, the failure to bring her service under
naval law – an aspiration which, according to one of her senior ofﬁcers,
‘has come to be looked on as the real test as to whether we are, or are
not, accepted into full partnership as an integral part of the Navy’70 –
was a source of regret. She believed that the opinions of the naval
commanders-in-chief should not have held such sway, ‘especially in
a matter concerning the status of women where so many men have
personal prejudices’, and it was wrong for the members of her force
‘to be legally civilians’: ‘I think this was the only major matter of policy
for the WRNS on which the Admiralty did not take my advice and
I must confess that I live up to the old adage in regard to convincing
a woman against her will.’71

6 NECESSITIES OF LIFE
Uniform
The basic uniform of the women’s services was similar in style
to that of their male ‘parent’ forces.1 Members of the ATS wore a khaki
jacket, shirt, tie and peaked cap; their counterparts in the WAAF an air
force blue jacket, pale blue shirt, black tie and air force blue peaked cap;
and those in the WRNS a navy blue jacket, white shirt, black tie and,
from 1942, a navy blue sailor hat (with a tricorne hat for ofﬁcers and
petty ofﬁcers). But servicewomen were provided with skirts, rather than
trousers, as well as a number of other feminine accoutrements such as
rayon knickers, boned corsets and lisle stockings.2 And, unlike their
male counterparts, they were expected to make do and mend. Marjorie
Hazell recalled WAAF clothing parades at which the ofﬁcers were
reluctant to exchange worn items for new ones on the grounds that
they could be repaired by their female owners: ‘This used to annoy the
WAAFs in particular, as they were naturally expected to darn their
stockings and mend their shirts, whereas an airman would often be
excused this.’3
As the war went on, and the range of jobs expanded, so the
working clothing of servicewomen became more ‘masculine’. ATS ‘gunners’, for example, put on battledress at their gun sites, WAAF ﬂight
mechanics donned overalls in their hangers and WRNS boats’ crews
sported bell bottoms on their harbour launches.4 But this propensity to
adopt male clothing did not always go uncontested, as the protracted

discussions in the Air Ministry over the issue of trousers for airwomen
testiﬁes. Towards the end of 1939, Jane Trefusis Forbes pressed for the
provision of ‘dark blue slacks’. She pointed out that due to the rapid
expansion of her service many recruits were still without a regulation
WAAF jacket and skirt and that trousers would provide additional
warmth as the winter approached.5 Yet some of her senior male colleagues were unconvinced. The view was put forward that ‘this form of
dress has not yet been universally accepted by women in this country’,
that it ‘might lead to humorous comment or ridicule’ and that it ‘would
take some years for the WAAF to live down’.6 DWAAF, however, was
determined to pursue the matter. Not only did she contend that it was
important that women’s lower limbs should be kept warm so as to
prevent ‘liver and bladder complaints’ and ‘feminine disorders’, but
also that many women working in the civil defence services and industry
wore trousers.7 It was agreed that slacks would be made available as
a temporary measure pending the provision of full uniform to Waafs.8
Although the Air Ministry intended that these trousers should
eventually be withdrawn, the air attacks on RAF stations during 1940
brought about a rethink. The raids meant that airwomen were often
required to rush during the night from their sleeping quarters into
protective trenches and spend long periods out in the cold.9 In these
circumstances, Trefusis Forbes called for the existing slacks to be
retained, and further pairs made available for new WAAF intakes, as
these could be quickly slipped into during an alert and would provide
the necessary warmth whilst women took shelter.10 The ﬁnance branch,
however, raised objections. It was doubted whether the time saved in
dressing, and the extra comfort of the wearer, warranted the £10,000
cost of this extra item of clothing. If trousers were considered necessary,
it was suggested that they could be issued in place of skirts with little or
no overall additional ﬁnancial outlay.11 DWAAF stood her ground. She
asserted that her Waafs working on aerodromes were squarely in the
target zone and it would ‘seem unfortunate’ to begrudge the extra
expenditure when their lives might depend on the speed with which
they could get to whatever cover was available. As for the notion that
WAAF skirts could be replaced by trousers, she dismissed this masculinisation as ‘absurd’. ‘It is unlikely’, she commented, ‘that anyone would
care to contemplate a force of women marching about in caps, tunics
and slacks.’12 Trefusis Forbes won the day, but the Treasury then
intervened in the matter. It was of the opinion that a stock of trousers

1::79

114 / Necessities of Life
should only be made available at selected RAF stations and that these
should be handed out temporarily to personnel at these bases, who
would then return them when posted elsewhere.13 The Air Ministry
responded that all its stations were considered likely targets of enemy
bombers and to retain this clothing for communal use would be both
impractical and uneconomic.14 Eventually, in 1941, ofﬁcial approval
was given for an issue of ‘slacks, blue’ to all airwomen who were not
entitled to working suits as part of their trade, but the RAF authorities
laid down that these trousers were to be worn ‘only when it is necessary
to take shelter from air raids’.15 After instances came to light of Waafs
wearing them on ‘unauthorised occasions’, an order was sent out the
following year reminding them of this air-raid stipulation.16
Some female personnel embellished and adapted their uniforms
to their own tastes. As Tessa Stone has argued, this was partly to
emphasise their individuality within the conformity of military life.17
In the WAAF, for example, junior ofﬁcers serving with Fighter
Command would – in the manner of the rafﬁsh RAF aircrew who
adopted their own characteristic modes of dress – stroll around with
coloured scarfs around their necks. When pulled up by their seniors for
infringing uniform regulations they would casually reply ‘oh, those rules
don’t apply to us, ma’am; you see, we’re “operational!”’18 But it was
also about retaining a sense of femininity. Thus some servicewomen
padded the shoulders of their jackets with government-issue sanitary
towels in order to create a more alluring silhouette; others surreptitiously shortened their skirts so that they conformed to a fashionable
length; and a number substituted daintier briefs for their voluminous
service knickers.19 Mary Thomson wore a string of pearls under her
ATS shirt because she wanted to adorn herself with ‘something that was
feminine’ while Constance Babington Smith splashed on lavish quantities of L’Heure Bleue perfume by Guerlain ‘on the theory that the
masculinity of WAAF uniform needed a little counteracting’.20 ‘On
the surface we might all look the same,’ conﬁded WAAF ofﬁcer
Muriel Gane Pushman, ‘but underneath – ah, underneath – we were
individual, female, and our souls were satin and lace.’21
On one occasion a concern for an attractive look seems to have
had tragic consequences. Early in 1944, Leading Wren Ann Walker was
working at a radial drilling machine in a maintenance shed at Port
Edgar. She was wearing a regulation blue bandanna distributed to
WRNS machine operators as a protective head covering. But, as was

1::79

the fashion of the day, she had left a portion of hair showing at the front
where the bandanna was tied in a bow. It appears that as Walker was
leaning over her machine to change the size of the drill, some of her hair
and head gear got caught in the vertical driving shaft which was still in
motion and, according to the board of inquiry set up to investigate the
incident, she suffered ‘a complete avulsion of ¾ʹ of the scalp, the whole
thickness being removed to the bone’.22 As a result of this horriﬁc
accident, it was laid down that WRNS personnel working on machines
with moving parts would be issued with ‘peaked safety caps’ and that
care was to be taken ‘to ensure that no loose ends of hair are visible
when the cap is worn.’23
The standard uniform of the WRNS was generally regarded as
the most stylish of the three women’s services.24 According to Anne de
Courcy, the blue-black design was chic, slimming and well-suited to
youthful British complexions. In her view, the dark tones, with their
subliminal references to policemen, exuded an air of ‘sophisticated
authority’: ‘To see a Wren ofﬁcer in full ﬁg was to view an attractive
woman with just that hint of the dominatrix that seems to appeal to so
many Englishmen, especially those from a public-school background.’25

Accommodation
A range of segregated living accommodation was provided for
the women’s forces. This included hutted camps, barrack blocks and
billets in private or requisitioned houses. The standard of quartering in
the WRNS was generally better than in the ATS or WAAF because of its
smaller size, its concentration around established naval ports, and the
fact that its ‘immobile’ branch lived in their own homes. But conditions
could be tough for servicewomen in the hastily constructed military bases
that sprung up across the country. It was not unusual, for example, for
female personnel to ﬁnd themselves living alongside a dozen or more
women in a drafty, prefabricated Nissen hut with a walk of several
hundred yards across a frozen ﬁeld to the nearest ablution block.26
Grace Houghton of the ATS recalled that at one anti-aircraft camp the
female latrines were enclosed from view by sacking hanging from four
posts staked in the ground: ‘When the sun shone your shadow could be
seen, and one morning the wind was so rough a post fell down and left
one of the Ats sat on the throne. What a cheer went up from the
gunners!’27

The military authorities did, however, seek to ease the plight of
servicewomen where they could. Members of the women’s services were
entitled to more generous accommodation scales than their male counterparts. Not only were they granted extra washing and toilet facilities,
but also additional sleeping space. In the ATS, each auxiliary was
permitted 45 square feet of space compared to 30 square feet for
a soldier; in the WRNS the equivalent ﬁgure was 40 square feet for
a Wren and 30 square feet for a naval rating; and in the WAAF it was 38
square feet for an airwoman and 32 square feet for an airman.28 ‘We
have tried where possible’, explained the DWAAF, Mary Welsh, ‘to
keep rather better living conditions generally for the airwomen because
we are sincerely anxious not to allow the airwomen to become brutalised by service conditions.’29 In the army it was the job of the Royal
Engineers to lay on the additional amenities for the ATS and the
enhanced sanitary arrangements were said to have been a particular
‘headache’ to them.30 Auxiliaries, for example, required more water
than soldiers, due in part to their frequent washing of underwear and
use of WCs rather than urinals. They also got through considerably

more toilet paper. In 1942 an allowance of three times the male rate was
agreed.31
For their part, female personnel sought to make their living
space as homely as possible. This could involve repainting the walls,
hanging civilian curtains, or rearranging beds and wardrobes in order
create more privacy.32 ‘To complete the homely effect’, wrote Olivia
Scovell of her ATS quarters, ‘many of the beds were adorned with
mascots of various kinds and in various stages of wear. Some of these
mascots had been taken to boarding schools at a tender age and
dragged through all the vicissitudes of a long school life before arriving in an army hut.’33 Constance Woodhead observed that ‘the
instinct for home-making never died in many of the service
women.’34 Meanwhile, some women ofﬁcers were determined to feminise the living quarters of their charges. Barbara Cartland, who
served as an honorary ATS welfare ofﬁcer in Bedfordshire, recalled
a titled ATS ofﬁcer who asked for
‘pretty pink satin cushions for the dear girls’ in a new camp, but
forgot, when passing the plans, to indent for gas rings in the
billets, so that when the place was completed it was found that
the girls had to walk a mile and a half for a cup of hot tea!35
If standards of ‘housekeeping’ fell below acceptable levels, the culprits
might be brought to book. WAAF ofﬁcer, Felicity Hill, admitted giving
her airwomen a stern telling off when she discovered that they had gone
on duty, leaving their hut in a chaotic state: ‘it infuriated me that
attractive girls could be so sluttish. What, I asked, would your ﬁancés
and boyfriends think if they could see in what unfeminine squalor you
choose to live?’36 This domestic primness also extended to displays of
male ‘pin-ups’. While few batted an eyelid at soldiers’ lockers adorned
with alluring pictures of Jane Russell, in many ATS barracks, images of
Tyrone Power, Errol Flynn or Clark Gable were banned by female
commanding ofﬁcers because they were considered bad for discipline.37
In certain circumstances, women were required to live temporarily under canvas. During the ﬂying bomb attacks in 1944, mixed antiaircraft units were hurriedly deployed to makeshift gun sites on the East
Anglian coast. Here, members of the ATS had to ‘rough it’ in leaky tents
that gave little protection from the mud and damp that pervaded the
marshy coastal areas. After a visit to one of the units, Tom Driberg, the
Independent MP for Maldon and former Beaverbrook press journalist,

1::79

‘exposed’ the primitive living conditions and the matter was raised in the
House of Commons. Most of the women, however, seem to have been
perfectly willing to face these hardships. The commander of a mixed
anti-aircraft brigade at Burnham assembled 1,000 auxiliaries serving
with his formation and offered to post any of them away within twentyfour hours if they felt they could not put up with the privations. He
received just nine applications – all from female clerks.38 According to
General Pile, ‘not one operational girl wished to do otherwise than to
stay and ﬁght the battle’.39

Food
Servicewomen were also provided with their meals. Female
personnel were allotted approximately four-ﬁfths of the male ration
entitlement in the expectation that they would require less to eat than
their male counterparts.40 In the ATS, this worked out at roughly 2,800
calories a day for each auxiliary.41 Adjustments were, however, made
for those who undertook more active duties than other women. Female
‘gunners’, for example, were put on the same ration scale as the men.42
The necessity of sharing kitchen and dining facilities with ‘parent services’ also helped to equalize matters. In the WAAF, strains on accommodation, shortages of manpower and the need for stringent fuel
economy, meant that many airwomen had to abandon their own dining
halls and eat in the big RAF station messes where they were served the
same rations as the men.43
The services were said to have received more and better food
than the heavily rationed civilian population.44 ‘Compared to civilian
rations,’ opined Marjorie Hazell, ‘we lived in luxury.’45 But the standard of fare was variable. Barbara Littlejohn recalled that at her ATS
signals training camp the staple diet of boiled potatoes, gritty cabbage,
fried spam and a suet pudding known as a ‘depth charge’ ‘would have
gone over alright in a Dickensian workhouse no doubt, but . . . did
nothing for our morale’: ‘Our big treat in the evening was to go down
into the town and eat baked beans on toast at the Salvation Army
canteen.’46 Waaf Mary Palmer complained that the meals at her RAF
base were so unappetising that ‘on entering the cook-house the smell put
us off before we got to the food . . . . The bins for pig-swill were chocka-block with our leftovers.’47 Eileen McMurdo of the ATS was

stationed at a combined operations headquarters at Fort Southwick,
near Portsmouth, and recorded that the naval cuisine there was little
better:
One thing which all three services had in common was the often
appalling standard of the food and the naval cooks did their best
to keep up the tradition of mediocrity.
At Southwick one of the ‘cook’s special’ dishes was a small,
round rissole which looked and tasted like india-rubber. I once
heard them being described in the mess hall by a burly, naval
rating using the sort of picturesque vulgarity at which the lower
mess deck excels.

‘Gawd strewth’ he exclaimed, ‘I see they’re serving up the
Captain’s balls again!’48
Moreover, if women brought their culinary grumbles to the attention of
superiors, they usually received short shrift. Waaf Mary Winter
recounted that ‘one day one girl, braver than the rest, answered back
when the WAAF ofﬁcer came round and asked if there were “any
complaints?” “Ask the ﬁsh, Ma’am,” said Biddy. “It speaks for itself.”
Needless to say, she got jankers.’49

Pay
The level of servicewomen’s pay was determined by the government shortly before the outbreak of war, on the premise that the pay
commonly drawn by women in civilian employment was less than men,
with an average difference of about one-third. Members of the women’s
forces, like their sisters working in the civil defence services, thus generally received two-thirds of the pay of their male colleagues of comparable rank and trade in their ‘parent services’. This was a principle
described by the Treasury as ‘fair relativity’. However, since
a proportion of the remuneration of the armed forces was provided in
kind, through such items as clothing, accommodation and food, the
overall ratio was said to have been higher than two thirds.50 At the end
of 1941, a private in the ATS with six months service earned 14s a week
in basic pay, but when these other elements were factored in, the total
emoluments rose to 50s 6d. This was nearer four-ﬁfths of the emoluments of an equivalent unmarried male private.51
The inequalities in service pay did not go unquestioned within
the military establishment. General Pile advocated that if ATS ‘gunners’
took over identical jobs from soldiers on the gun sites it was only right
that they should receive the same rates of pay as their male
counterparts.52 In similar terms, Admiral Sir ‘Jack’ Tovey questioned
why the remuneration of WRNS ofﬁcers was so much lower than shorebased male Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ofﬁcers when they held
appointments of equal responsibility.53 The disparities were starkly
exposed when women proved more capable than the men they worked
alongside. ‘There were undoubtedly cases here and there’, admitted
Constance Woodhead’, ‘where an ofﬁcer or airwoman was “carrying”
an RAF ofﬁcer or airman and being paid two thirds of his rate, possibly

even holding a rank junior to his while she did the best part of his
work.’54 Nevertheless, the women’s forces seem to have accepted the
inequity with comparatively little complaint.55 Helen GwynneVaughan conceded that although she had spent her entire professional
civilian life ﬁghting for equal pay, it was difﬁcult to justify the same level
of remuneration for servicewomen, since in many cases they did not
replace men on a head-for-head basis and, ultimately, would not be
called upon to ﬁght as combatants. ‘In view of the fact that the State is
prepared to employ women only in the background and of their consequent lesser utility,’ she acknowledged, ‘it is fair that their pay should
be less than that of soldiers who are liable to be sent forward.’56 Vera
Laughton Mathews shared these sentiments. She had been hesitant to
support the two-thirds pay formula on the grounds of equality, but
came to the conclusion that it was vindicated by the greater dangers
faced by servicemen:
I realised that in the Services there was some justiﬁcation for less
pay for women. Although, in fact, there were men at shore bases
doing precisely the same work as women and no better, even
men precluded by health from going to sea, yet in the main, men
in the armed forces were recruited for a life of hardship and
danger and sacriﬁce beyond all comparison with what was
demanded of women. One could not measure such sacriﬁce in
terms of pay, but nor could one with any conscience attempt to
argue for equal pay for those who were allowed to give so much
less.57
In 1943, the Woman Power Committee sponsored a debate in the House
of Commons on ‘women in national service’ during which the issue of
equal pay for servicewomen was raised. Edith Summerskill, one of the
members of the WPC, declared that when the matter had been aired in
parliament earlier in the war, it had been explained that woman in the
forces could not receive the same pay as their male counterparts because
many of them did not substitute for men on a one-for-one basis. This,
she maintained, was no longer the position as women were replacing
men head-for-head. Furthermore, she contended, if servicewomen were
paid less than men on the basis that they were non-combatants, not only
did this have dubious validity in the case of ATS ‘gunners’, but also
begged the question as to why soldiers serving in the non-combatant
branches of the army, such as the Pioneer Corps, were paid at the same

1::79

rate as those in the ﬁghting arms.58 If the level of danger determined pay,
she surmised, ‘we must argue that a private in the front line in Sicily
should be paid more than a general in Whitehall’.59
The Minister Without Portfolio, Sir William Jowitt, responded
for the government after having been briefed by the service
departments.60 Whilst he agreed that there were many jobs being undertaken by women on a one-for-one basis, it was pointed out that there
were still a signiﬁcant number of roles that required a three-for-two
substitution ratio. He asserted, moreover, that all soldiers, including
those in the Pioneer Corps, could be called to perform ‘combatant
duties’ in an emergency, whilst no servicewomen, even those on the
gun sites, would be required to do so.61 ‘The question arises,’ he
observed, ‘as to how far these jobs done by women and men can really
be said to be comparable.’62 The government position thus remained
unchanged.
As for the amount of money they were paid, some young servicewomen found themselves with more disposable income in the forces
than they had in civilian life. Grace Houghton had handed over most of

the wages from her job in a carpet factory to her mother, so when she
joined the ATS ‘I thought I was rich’.63 Others, however, tended to ﬁnd
themselves running short before the weekly pay parade came around.
Eileen Hazell discovered that her ATS pay ‘did not go very far. One had
to be an expert to juggle all the little bits and pieces one needed.’64
A number continued to make ﬁnancial contributions to their families
after entering the services. Waaf Mary Mackenzie arranged for part of
her earnings to be sent home to help support her disabled father and
‘hard-pressed’ mother, who had lost both their house and their cooked
meat business in Brighton during a bombing raid. As a result, she never
received more than half of her pay whilst in the forces.65

7 MEDICAL MATTERS
Medical Arrangements
At the start of the war, servicewomen who required medical
attention were generally treated by male medical ofﬁcers of their ‘parent’ services in the same way that women patients in civilian life were
often looked after by male practitioners. But as the women’s forces
expanded, so female medical ofﬁcers were appointed to camps and
bases where there were signiﬁcant concentrations of female
personnel.1 This was timely. In the army it was reported that there
was a curious reluctance on the part of some male regimental medical
ofﬁcers to undertake the care of members of the ATS and one senior
Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) staff ofﬁcer announced that his
subordinates could not possibly examine them ‘below the chest’.2
The status of women doctors in the wartime armed forces
became, however, a matter of controversy. Before the outbreak of
hostilities, the Medical Women’s Federation (MWF) had approached
the War Ofﬁce in anticipation of female medical practitioners being
recruited into the services and pressed for them to be employed in the
army on the same terms and conditions as their male counterparts.3 Yet
although they were granted equal pay, the army authorities decided that
they would not be commissioned into the RAMC. Instead, they were to
be ‘attached’ to the corps and given relative rank.4 The position of
women doctors serving with the RAF’s medical branch was similar.5
This anomalous status could on occasions leave female medical ofﬁcers

1::79

3 /

125 / Medical Arrangements
in an invidious position with regard to other medical staff, particularly
in view of the fact that they were invariably called upon to treat male
personnel in the medical facilities in which they worked.6
In 1941, ofﬁcers in the ATS and WAAF were granted the king’s
commission after the promulgation of the Defence (Women’s Forces)
Regulations. As a result, female doctors serving with the army were
offered commissions in the ATS.7 This reignited the debate over their
status. In the autumn, the MWF wrote to the War Ofﬁce calling upon it
to commission female medical ofﬁcers into the RAMC:
The proposal to segregate medical women in the Women’s
Forces, so that they serve with and not in the RAMC appears
to us seriously to contravene the recognised principle of professional equality between men and women practitioners, and is
therefore unacceptable to medical women. Women doctors
volunteer to serve with the Army as doctors and not as
women, and they consider that any arrangement which places
them in a separate category from their professional colleagues
infringes this fundamental principle.8
The army authorities were unmoved. Not only was it argued that there
was no legal authority to grant women commissions in the male ‘land
forces of the crown’, but also that circumstances could arise in which
RAMC ofﬁcers, like those in other technical corps, were required to
exercise command over soldiers in their capacity as ﬁghting men and
that this obligation could not be properly carried out by women.
Furthermore, the fact that some 80 per cent of female medical ofﬁcers
accepted commissions in the ATS, with the rest opting to remain under
their existing contracts, seemed to vindicate the War Ofﬁce position.9
The MWF did not let the matter rest. In the spring of 1942,
a letter from its president, Dr Clara Stewart, was published in the British
Medical Journal in which she asserted that the different status of women
doctors serving with the army and RAF – the Royal Navy chose to
commission its female medical ofﬁcers into the Royal Naval Volunteer
Reserve – violated ‘the long-established and well-proved principle of
complete equality between medical men and women’.10 She contended
that there was no insuperable difﬁculty to commissioning female doctors into, if necessary, temporary womens’ sections of the army and
RAF medical services and that in the event of a military emergency
‘medical women would be expected to rise to the occasion just as

1::79

126 / Medical Matters
medical men would do, and in such circumstances it would unquestionably be easier for all concerned if they had well-deﬁned rank and status.’
In the meantime, she advised women doctors not to accept commissions
in the women forces.11
The War Ofﬁce held ﬁrm in the face of this ultimatum and the
MWF was informed that female medical ofﬁcers would in future be
required to accept commissions in the women’s services. This in effect
closed the matter.12 Reﬂecting on the episode, the ofﬁcial historian of
the Army Medical Services, Professor Francis Crew, could not disguise
the departmental exasperation over an issue
which, having its origin in a praiseworthy endeavour to secure
the adjustment of patent anomalies, developed into something
of an agitation concerned primarily with the furthering of social
principles which at this time seemed to have no place in military
affairs. Certainly the women medical ofﬁcers serving in the
Army were far less interested in the theoretical considerations
pertaining to their status than were their ofﬁcial champions.13
For its part, the MWF continued to sit indignantly on the sidelines. ‘It is
difﬁcult to understand’, remarked the writer of one internal memorandum, ‘the grudging and reactionary attitude of the Whitehall
authorities.’14 Nevertheless, it did what it could to assist medical
recruiting for the forces and had to admit that ‘women doctors in the
Services had very little to complain of’.15 At their peak numbers, some
600 female medical ofﬁcers were serving with the army, 117 with the
RAF and 25 with the Royal Navy.16
Servicewomen underwent regular medical inspections (‘free
from infection’ or ‘FFIs’ as they were invariably known) and arrangements were made for those who were unwell to report sick. Minor
ailments were normally treated in designated sick quarters in the units
or camps to which they were attached (or at home in the case of Wren
‘immobiles’). In the ATS, such accommodation was allotted on the basis
of 2 per cent of strength, double the rate for male soldiers, with a similar
level of provision in the WAAF. More serious cases were admitted to
female wards in military hospitals, or civilian Emergency Medical
Service (EMS) hospitals, depending on local circumstances. Those
with mental illnesses could be sent to specialist institutions such as the
Neurosis Centre at Mill Hill or St Andrew’s psychiatric hospital in
Northampton.17 Leslie Whateley commented that if soldiers were

127 / Medical Arrangements
hospitalised their fathers did not expect regular reports from commanding ofﬁcers on their sons’ conditions, unless dangerously ill, but mothers
of her auxiliaries ‘presumed this their right in the case of daughters’.18
Indeed, when Clementine Churchill was informed that a woman in
Mary Churchill’s ATS barrack room had contracted meningitis, she
arrived unannounced at the camp within twenty-four hours to check
up on her daughter. ‘The authorities’, recounted an embarrassed Mary,
‘were annoyed by her turning up in such an irregular fashion.’19
Convalescent facilities were extended to women in the services
who required rehabilitation before returning to their duties. These were
generally run by the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St. John
on behalf of the EMS, and were usually situated in large country
houses.20 They did not, however, offer much in the way of reorientation
to the rigours of service life and, as Julie Anderson has shown, the female
patients were reported to ‘sit about over the ﬁre and on the lawns and on
their return to their units are found to be unﬁt for a full day’s work’.21
To help improve matters, in 1943 an ATS Reconditioning Centre (a title
widely derided) was established at Hatchford Park, near Cobham in
Surrey. This took on the role of a convalescent depot, similar to those
provided for soldiers, as well as a general physical development establishment for undersized women recruits. Under the command of
a female medical ofﬁcer, the ‘trainees’ (they were not to be called
‘patients’) participated in an intensive three-to-ﬁve-week programme
of physical exercise and educational activities.22
Some rudimentary health education was given to women on
joining up and this included instruction in matters of personal
hygiene.23 In the WAAF, a lecture on VD and pregnancy was part of
the syllabus, but this was not always very enlightening.24 Mary Lee
Settle recalled that such a talk was delivered to her intake by a stern,
Eton-cropped, female ofﬁcer wielding a swagger-stick who told them
‘about crabs, warned about toilet seats, skipped over prophylactics,
urged antiseptics, pictured tertiary paralysis’. ‘She looked as if the only
sex she had experienced,’ observed Settle, ‘was a ﬂipped towel in
a locker room.’25 Another Waaf, Jean Wallace, lamented the lack of
meaningful sex education for those who were inexperienced in such
matters. ‘There certainly were no contraceptives made available to the
girls,’ she reminisced, ‘so our fate was in the hands of our men. All we
had were myths and old wives’ stories which we had brought into the
forces with us, like the popular one that if you had sex standing up, you

128 / Medical Matters
could not get pregnant. No consideration was shown for the private
dilemmas which we faced.’26
In the WRNS, there was some pressure to issue contraceptives
to female personnel. Vera Laughton Mathew recounted that a senior
Admiral sought to convince her service’s medical superintendent,
Dr Genevieve Rewcastle, to make prophylactics available to the
Wrens, in the same way that they were issued to their naval counterparts, but he was told that ‘there was no indication that such a policy
was necessary’. On another occasion, a naval medical ofﬁcer
approached a senior WRNS ofﬁcer along similar lines, arguing that
‘They’re going to do these things and we may as well accept the fact’.
But Laughton Mathews was having none of it. ‘We did not accept it’, she
insisted. ‘We expected a very high standard of conduct and the Wrens
knew it.’27

The Health of Servicewomen
The fact that servicewomen were predominantly young and ﬁt
ensured that their health was generally good.28 But the incidence of
minor sickness in the women’s forces was found to be higher than in the
male services. In the WRNS, it was at least 40 per cent above that in the
Royal Navy.29 In the ATS, it was roughly double that in the army.30
These different rates were put down to the fact that female personnel
were encouraged to report sick at an early stage and were conﬁned to
bed for complaints which a serviceman might have been told to
ignore.31
The picture was not, however, uniform. The level of minor
sickness in the WAAF was twice that in the RAF during the ﬁrst two
years of the war, but from 1942 the female rate came more into line with
that of the male.32 This realignment was thought to be connected to the
changing social class proﬁle of the airwomen. During the early period of
the conﬂict, the WAAF was still a volunteer force and a signiﬁcant
number of its recruits were said to be drawn from the middle and uppermiddle classes. These Waafs, it was claimed, had been sheltered as
children from many of the commoner ailments and thus had less immunity to them. Furthermore, it was opined that their upbringing had
conditioned them to be very health conscious and to seek immediate
medical advice, even for the most minor of complaints. Yet with the
military conscription of women from late 1941, the social background

1::79

129 / The Health of Servicewomen
of the WAAF intakes widened and, according to the ofﬁcial history of
the RAF medical services: ‘more familiar with physical discomfort and
its occasional medical consequences, these recruits were much less concerned by it and regarded such things as colds, coughs and minor skin
disorders as part of the general pattern of everyday life to be endured
without surprise or complaint’.33
There were further occupational variations. In the WRNS, an
inquiry at one ‘northerly’ naval air station in 1944 found that the rate of
minor sickness among cooks was four times greater than among
mechanics and seventeen times greater than among writers. It was
thought that this was primarily the result of the cooks working a threewatch system that did not allow them enough time for rest and
relaxation.34 In the WAAF, the airwomen serving in Bomber
Command were discovered to have appreciably lower annual rates of
sickness than those in other RAF commands. This was puzzling since
many of the bomber stations were located in ‘bleak cold areas’ near the
east coast and the amenities during the expansion of these bases had
often been primitive. It was surmised that in such an active operational
command the Waafs ‘found themselves too busy to be ill’.35
In relation to their mental health, the rate of discharges due to
mental ‘disorders’ was generally higher for servicewomen than for
men.36 In the WAAF, where invalidings on the grounds of psychoneuroses peaked at almost three times the male rate, this was put
down to the particular problems young, sheltered female personnel
faced in adjusting to military life:
This difference was almost certainly due to the greater difﬁculty
women experienced in adapting themselves to Service conditions. A considerable proportion of these women had never had
a civilian job and tended to break down rapidly under conditions of community regimentation. They were usually solitary,
shy individuals with few external interests and dependent on
maternal decisions. They had a tendency to form strong emotional attachments.37
As Hazel Croft has shown, male service psychiatrists made a number of
gendered observations about the suitability of female personnel for the
armed forces in their assessments of servicewomen who suffered
breakdowns.38 They drew attention, among other factors, to women
joining up ‘impulsively for glamour and excitement’; to the fact that

1::79

.

they were ‘not so accustomed to discipline in daily life’; to women being
‘very prone to hysterical reactions under service conditions’; and to ‘the
psycho-biological signiﬁcance of service in the armed forces, implying as
it does the subordination of traditional female values and primary
biological functions in the compulsory interruption of the reproductive
career at its optimum period’.39
As the war went on, particular physical health issues relating to
servicewomen were highlighted by the military authorities. One such
matter was foot deformities. It was reported, for example, that over half
of ATS recruits had some anomaly of the feet. The problem was said to
be partly the result of wearing poorly designed, high-heeled civilian
shoes. Recruits were thus invariably left hobbling about uncomfortably
in their stout, new, ﬂatter-heeled service shoes after a day’s drilling. As
a result, special care was taken to ensure that military footwear was
properly ﬁtted, instruction was given in the care of the feet and chiropodists provided treatment in more serious cases.40
Another concern was head infestation. An investigation at ATS
training centres in 1941, revealed that a quarter of intakes were infested

with pediculosis capitis (head lice). A similar proportion was found to
be affected among WAAF entrants in 1942. The rates of infestation,
however, varied according to the regions from which recruits were
drawn, with the ﬁgures for the North and Midlands being higher than
those for the South and the highest levels identiﬁed among those from
Northern Ireland (among whom a considerable proportion hailed from
Eire).41 The afﬂiction was thought to be related to poor and overcrowded civilian living conditions, but also to the reluctance of
women to wash their hair after expensive hair treatments.42 The disinfestation of such large numbers of female trainees presented considerable difﬁculties and some of the accepted remedies, such as the
application of vinegar, parafﬁn or sassafras to the scalp, were found to
be of doubtful effectiveness. Trials were therefore carried out of new
preparations and a thiocyanate known as ‘lethane 384 special’ was
adopted which proved very effective. Alongside treatment, servicewomen were encouraged to wear their hair short, wash it regularly
and comb it thoroughly. It was recorded that by the time airwomen
were posted away from WAAF training depots the infestation rate had
fallen to under 2 per cent, while the rate among trained ATS auxiliaries
was less than 1 per cent.43
A further issue was menstrual disorders. In 1945, a survey of the
ATS revealed that approximately a quarter of its personnel had experienced some form of menstrual disturbance – mainly amenorrhoea or
delayed menstruation – on entry into the service. This was regarded as
common among women who had undergone a major disruption to their
way of life, like that entailed on joining up.44 In 1944, a study of the
military occupations of those in the WAAF who had suffered from
amenorrhoea showed that the highest incidences were to be found
among airwomen in sedentary jobs, such as clerks, whilst the lowest
rates were among those in more strenuous roles, such as ﬂight
mechanics. It was thus concluded that the more active the work, the
better the menstrual health.45 The vast majority of servicewomen were
reported to have corrected themselves within six months without medical intervention, but a small number who continued without menstruating, in some cases for up to ﬁfteen months, required endocrine
treatment.46 Women in the forces also suffered from varying degrees
of dysmenorrhoea (pain during menstruation).47 In the ATS, it was
advised that the attitude of those in authority should be ‘tactful and
sympathetic, neither too spartan nor too coddling’. It was recommended

that auxiliaries in discomfort be permitted to lie down for a couple of
hours, with a cup of tea and a hot water bottle on the abdomen, but that
they should be encouraged to return to work as soon as possible.48 An
additional complication was menorrhagia (abnormally heavy or prolonged menstruation).49 Since it was believed that this condition could
be triggered by the vibration of tracked vehicles, such as Bren gun
carriers, members of the ATS were forbidden to drive this type of
transport.50
Fears about sterility surfaced too. Shortly after the mixed antiaircraft batteries were formed in 1941, rumours began to circulate in the
ATS that those operating the radar sets used for gun laying would be
rendered infertile. These stories appeared to have some credibility since
the cathode ray tubes used with the radar apparatus had some similarities to x-ray tubes, the radiation from which was known to have
deleterious effects on reproductive functions. The Medical Research
Council was asked to investigate and found that no hazardous rays
were emitted from the radar equipment. The rumours, however, kept
reoccurring and were never completely scotched.51 Brigadier John
Rawlings Rees, the consulting psychiatrist to the British army, put
these down to cases of transient amenorrhoea among female ‘gunners’
combined with anxieties about the hardening and defeminising effects
of such operational duties.52
Meanwhile, the sanitary habits of some female military personnel raised a few eyebrows. Sanitary towels (STs) were issued free of
charge.53 Yet not only did some of the more naive recruits have little
understanding of the purpose of these products, continuing to employ
rags which they then rinsed out in readiness for their next period,54 but
others put them to rather unorthodox use. In the WAAF, this included
polishing buttons, removing make-up, straining ground coffee, mufﬂing
the noise of banging doors and being worn across the eyes (with the
loops ﬁtted neatly around the ears) when trying to sleep after night
duty.55 Moreover, when STs were utilised for their intended purpose,
their disposal frequently left something to be desired. Although special
waste disposal bins were provided, many ﬂushed their used articles
down the lavatory. This invariably blocked the drains. More worryingly, there was a tendency on the part of some to shove the offending
items (often unwrapped) into odd corners, such as the back of cupboards or behind pipes, or even to leave them lying on the ﬂoor or on
window sills.56 Corporal Vera Cole of the ATS recalled that a woman in

1::79

133 / Venereal Disease
an adjacent room to hers was discovered to have stuffed soiled STs (or
‘bunnies’ as they were nicknamed in the service57) under her mattress.
This rotted the fabric and created such an odour that the bedding had to
be taken way and burnt by two male orderlies. ‘It was not a very
pleasant job’, admitted Cole, ‘and made the rest of us feel ashamed’.58
Female ofﬁcers and NCOs could only maintain constant vigilance and
exhort their charges to act hygienically.59
For their part, some servicemen were not above a bit of gentle
ribbing of their female colleagues with regard to their monthly periods.
Dorothy Calvert and her fellow auxiliaries had to collect their STs from
the medical inspection room in their mixed battery, where they were
required to sign for them (in order, she reckoned, to demonstrate to the
medical ofﬁcer that they were ‘not in the pudding club’). She was then
forced to carry hers back to her hut in a plain cardboard box to avoid
being spotted by the soldiers. ‘In those days’, Calvert reminisced, ‘girls
were very self conscious of being female. We hated the men to know
what we were doing, as they would strike up singing, “The Red Flag,” or
“Red Sails in the Sunset,” or something equally apt.’60

Venereal Disease
The military authorities had long experience of coping with VD
among servicemen, but its occurrence among servicewomen brought
new dimensions to the problem. It was a difﬁcult disease to diagnose in
females since there were often no overt symptoms, as was usually the
case with males.61 Also, the social stigma attached to it was greater for
women than for men and associated with the ‘moral laxity’ of the ‘goodtime girl’ or the ‘amateur prostitute’.62 Jane Trefusis Forbes opined that
‘if a man has v.d. it is taken for granted, but if a woman has it she is
a disgrace to the country’.63
Careful provision thus had to be made for dealing with VD in
the women’s forces. To help identify the condition in the ATS, which
the routine medical inspections could not hope to pick up, a number
of camp sick quarters were designated as ‘gynaecological centres’,
where experienced women medical ofﬁcers could examine those who
were suspected of having the disease. Auxiliaries were not forced to
undergo examination, but if they refused, and there were strong
grounds to believe that they were infected, they could be discharged
‘services no longer required’. For those members of the ATS requiring

1::79

134 / Medical Matters
hospitalisation, the treatment of VD came to be concentrated in three
general army hospitals: Shenley (from 1941), Netley (from 1942) and
Chester (from 1943). It was hoped that by incorporating these
patients in establishments that catered for auxiliaries with other ailments, the ignominy of the specialist VD hospital might be avoided.64
This was not, however, always successful. An American venereologist
visited Shenley and reported that when the weekly trainload of female
VD cases arrived they were ostracised by the staff, who viewed them
as ‘moral lepers’.65 At this time VD was still regarded by the army as
a type of self-inﬂicted wound and, like soldiers, auxiliaries admitted to
hospital with it had part of their pay docked while undergoing treatment. But this, it was contended by medical ofﬁcers, tended simply to
deter those with VD from declaring their condition. In 1944, it was
decided that both men and women should incur no stoppages from
their pay for the ﬁrst thirty days of treatment (which covered most
cases).66
In the WAAF, those who were found to be suffering from VD
were originally sent to the London Lock hospital: a long-standing
civilian VD clinic. It came to be regarded, however, as undesirable for
airwomen to be associated with such an institution and cared for alongside non-service women of ‘doubtful character’. From 1942, VD cases
were transferred to the RAF general hospital at Evesham. This, it was
calculated, would better preserve the conﬁdentiality of the patients and
thus reduce the notoriety of their condition.67 After treatment, an airwoman was to be posted to a new RAF station in order ‘to give her
a fresh start in life’.68 In the WRNS, arrangements were made by the
naval authorities for Wrens with VD to be admitted to hospitals willing
to take them, but it was reported that the disease ‘presented no problem’
in this smaller and ‘carefully selected’ force.69
The incidence of VD among servicewomen varied over the war.
In the ATS, the rate peaked at 5.3 cases per 1,000 women in 1942.
Thereafter, it declined to less than 1.0 per 1,000 for the rest of the war.70
The same broad pattern emerged in the WAAF. The rate was 1.15 cases
per 1,000 in 1940; it reached a high of 3.88 per 1,000 in 1942; and then
fell to 2.11 per 1,000 by 1945 (see Table 2 in appendix). These ﬁgures
were considerably lower than those for soldiers and airmen. The average annual rate for the army in the United Kingdom was over 10.0 cases
per 1,000, while the equivalent rate for the RAF was nearly 9.0 per
1,000.71

135 / Pregnancy
The VD levels in the WAAF were closely scrutinised in the Air
Ministry. The ﬂuctuations were difﬁcult to explain, but it was thought
that the comparatively low rates early in the war might have been the
result of missed cases, while the decline after 1942 was related to
a gradual decrease in the younger age groups among the WAAF intakes –
the highest rates tended to be among the eighteen to twenty-one-yearolds – and the cumulative effects of anti-VD lectures and propaganda.
Another inﬂuence on the variations was the degree of undetected preservice infection. In 1942, for example, 1.4 per 1,000 of the new recruits
were said to have contracted VD before entry.72 Analysis of the levels of
VD across WAAF trades in 1942 revealed that the highest incidence
occurred among airwomen in less skilled jobs, such as waitresses, while
the lowest rates were among those in higher skilled roles, such as radio,
radar and teleprinter operators.73 The reduced levels among radar
operators, for instance, was put down to the fact that ‘the standard of
girls attracted to this trade was high’ and that they ‘maintained higher
social and moral standards’ than those in other types of work.74
Members of the RAF were – perhaps unsurprisingly in view of their
close interaction with the WAAF – alleged to be the chief source of VD
infection among airwomen. In 1942, they were held responsible for
nearly half of cases, with British soldiers and civilians blamed for most
of the rest. A shift, however, took place in 1944. Whilst a third of
infections were still attributed to the RAF, the allied and dominion
forces were now deemed to account for a similar proportion (see
Table 3 in appendix). It was presumed that this was the result of the
increased numbers of overseas military personnel in the UK ‘far
removed from their home environment and family ties’.75 The rates
among Waafs serving in Bomber Command were reported to be consistently higher than those in Fighter Command. This was believed to
reﬂect the similarly differing levels of disease among the airmen in these
two commands.76

Pregnancy
Pregnancy among servicewomen presented a further set of challenges to the military authorities. Carrying a child was not thought
compatible with efﬁcient military service and pregnant women were
released from the forces. In the ATS and WAAF, it was intended that
this should normally be three months after conception. In the WRNS,

1::79

.

80

3 91/.

136 / Medical Matters
expectant Wrens were permitted to stay on as long as circumstances
permitted, provided that this was ‘not likely to cause physical strain’ or
was an ‘inconvenience to fellow workers’. Most were discharged after
six months.77
In order to be released, women had to have a medical certiﬁcate conﬁrming their pregnancy.78 For those in the ATS who suspected they might be in this condition, the camp gynaecological
centres were able to assist in providing a diagnosis. Arrangements
were also made for pregnancy tests to be carried out when necessary
at the University of Edinburgh’s Pregnancy Diagnosis Laboratory
(which had been established by Francis Crew in the inter-war years
and was attached to the university’s Institute of Animal Genetics). The
Aschheim-Zondek test utilised in this process involved injecting the
urine of auxiliaries into female mice and if the woman was pregnant
the urine induced changes in the ovaries of the mice. The supply of
suitable rodents was, however, severely curtailed by the destruction of
the stocks of one of the country’s largest breeders by enemy bombing
and a shortage of animal feedstuffs. As a result, the frequency of the
test had to be restricted and the onus put back on unit medical
ofﬁcers.79 WAAF personnel were also subject to the AschheimZondek procedure but those in the WRNS were assessed using the
Xenopus laevis test. Instead of mice, this employed South African
claw-toed frogs, which, despite the difﬁculties of importing, the
Royal Navy managed to source.80
Reliable statistics on pregnancy rates among servicewomen
were not available until some time into the war, partly because releases
on these grounds tended to be lumped together with other compassionate discharges,81 but the ﬁgures indicate a steady increase. In the
WAAF, the level rose from 46.2 cases per 1,000 in 1942, to 89.7 per
1,000 in 1944. In the ATS, it grew over the same period from 55.23 per
1,000, to 89.87 per 1,000 (see Table 4 in appendix). A breakdown of the
ATS ﬁgures for the period from July 1943 to December 1944 revealed
that 409 per 1,000 of the married strength, and 28 per 1,000 of the
unmarried strength, were discharged pregnant (see Table 5 in appendix). This meant that nearly half of all married auxiliaries – married
women making up approximately one-seventh of the overall strength in
early 194482 – were lost to the service due to pregnancy during this
period. This was described in the ofﬁcial history of the Army Medical
Services as a ‘remarkable ﬁgure’.83

137 / Pregnancy
Unmarried pregnancies were, however, a more problematic
issue within the women’s forces – not least in the harm it did to their
reputation.84 There were a few women who deliberately sought impregnation with the intention of securing release. In the ATS, expectant
auxiliaries were discharged under paragraph eleven of the relevant
appendix of the service’s regulations and this administrative clause
became a code word for ‘in the family way’. Anne Varley recalled that
‘one of my mates was so determined that she crept to the men’s quarters
and shouted “Para 11” under the windows. She was hauled in within
seconds and later obtained her discharge and an illegal abortion.’85 Yet
most seem to have fallen pregnant unintentionally and had to come to
terms with their predicament as best they could. Some were so ashamed
and fearful that they tried to harm themselves. Olive Noble caught one
of her fellow Waafs downing a bottle of aspirins in the toilet and
grabbed it off her: ‘When I enquired why on earth she was taking such
drastic action, her reply was that she was “Pregnant” and was
desperate . . . . I told her nothing was worth giving up your own “life”
for.’86 Others sought to conceal their condition for as long as possible,
often in the hope of a miscarriage. This was a problem for medical staff
since the regular health inspections could not identify all cases, especially as it was possible for women to absent themselves during these
check-ups and it was not always easy for female ofﬁcers to notice the
expanding ﬁgures of their subordinates hidden beneath service jackets.
Even if they were suspected of being pregnant, they could not be forced
to undergo an examination to determine this.87 As a result, a number of
babies were born in military camps and bases. According to Felicity Hill,
one airwoman, who was discovered to be in the early stages of labour,
had her baby girl delivered in the sick quarters of RAF Benson. The male
station commander was said to have doted on the child, fellow Waafs
knitted bootees, and when the mother left the service and went home to
her parents, she announced that she intended to name her daughter
‘Bensonia’.88 But there were more tragic tales. Sylvia Drake-Brockman
recounted that at RAF Silverstone the remains of a ﬁve-month-old
foetus were found in a lavatory pan: ‘Needless to say the expectant
mother was never discovered’.89
Considerable thought was given to the welfare of unmarried
pregnant personnel. ‘An illegitimate child’s life’, emphasised Trefusis
Forbes, ‘is of the same value as a legitimate child’ and the women’s
forces put in place a good deal of support for these expectant mothers.90

138 / Medical Matters
It was recognised that they were likely to be under ‘great mental strain’
and required ‘especially sympathetic handling’. Advice was to be provided on such matters as ante-natal services, places of conﬁnement,
maternity beneﬁts and afﬁliation orders. The servicewomen were
encouraged to take their families into their conﬁdence and return
home to be cared for. Those, however, who did not wish to disclose
their condition to relatives (the ATS chose not to inform parents unless
requested by an auxiliary, whilst the WAAF and WRNS reserved the
right to notify them if a woman was under twenty-one years of age), or
whose relations were unwilling, or unable, to look after them, could be
put in touch with such voluntary organisations as the Church of
England Moral Welfare Council that could make maternity arrangements on their behalf and facilitate their admission to an appropriate
moral welfare hostel. To smooth the transition to civilian life, in 1942
the ATS established a Special Discharge Depot at Whittington Hall,
near Worcester, where unmarried auxiliaries could be accommodated
whilst assistance for them was being put in place in advance of release.
Servicewomen who wished to return to the forces were permitted to do
so six months after giving birth, if they were regarded as being suitable
for re-enrolment.91 Edith Summerskill praised the ‘humane and moral
approach’ of the services and opined that ‘the harsh realities of war help
people to see this age-old problem in its proper perspective’.92 Barbara
Cartland expressed similar – if more forthright – views:
The Services did their best for those girls . . .
They needed an encouraging word, a helping hand, not sermons or ﬁngers pointed in scorn.
It was always the plain, withered virgins who had never been
tempted and never had the opportunity of going wrong who had
the most to say about it.93
In fact, some single airwomen admitted that they joined the WAAF
knowing they were pregnant because of the support they would receive
inside the force once their condition became known.94
As the war went on, it became clear that additional facilities
were required for unmarried expectant mothers who could not be cared
for by their families. Not only did it prove increasingly difﬁcult for
voluntary organisations to make adequate maternity arrangements for
all those who needed them, given the wartime increase in illegitimate
births on the home front, but there was also reluctance on the part of

1::79

.

3 /

139 / Pregnancy
some servicewomen to enter moral welfare hostels because of their strict
rules and regulations. As a result, a number were forced into poor law
institutions to have their babies. Although they had no ofﬁcial obligation towards their former personnel after they had left the women’s
forces, the military authorities were naturally anxious about this state of
affairs and lobbied the Ministry of Health to develop a maternity
scheme for unmarried servicewomen – a process expedited by the
Markham report which recommended that the ministry should give
urgent attention to the needs of expectant mothers. From 1943, servicewomen were thus entitled to apply for admission to government maternity hostels if they could not obtain assistance from other agencies. The
Soldiers’, Sailors’ and Airmen’s Help Society sifted the cases and acted
as a link between the services and the ministry.95 By the spring of 1945,
over 900 applications had been received from members of the women’s
services for places in these hostels.96
For some in the forces, this was not enough. In the autumn of
1944, the Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, Air Chief
Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, took time from overseeing the strategic
bombing of Germany to write a strong letter to the Air Ministry about
the issue of unmarried pregnant airwomen in his command. He argued
that the policy for the disposal of these personnel was inadequate
because the concealment of pregnancies until a late stage made it difﬁcult for proper arrangements to be made by the voluntary organisations
or the Ministry of Health. Not only did he suggest that many single
airwomen were reluctant to report their condition because of the perceived disgrace of having to return home, discharged and disowned by
the WAAF, but also that the problem was aggravated by the Air
Ministry’s practice of informing the parents of those under twentyone. This made them even more determined to hide their pregnancies,
particularly those from ‘a good home background’. Furthermore, he
contended that the RAF authorities had a strong moral obligation to
care for these airwomen since service conditions were partly responsible
for their situation:
The conscription of minors into its ranks, the youth of the
WAAF as a whole and of many of its administrative Ofﬁcers
in particular, must surely be accounted as contributory causes in
the rise of the illegitimate pregnancy rate, whilst the opportunity and temptations offered by the enforced propinquity of

1::79

.

80

3 91/.

3 /

4 8 .0/

/89 :

140 / Medical Matters
communal Service life, must be regarded as additional factors in
the increase of laxity.97
He therefore proposed that the Air Ministry should no longer force out
pregnant unmarried airwomen who were unable to make private
arrangements. Instead, they would be retained as unpaid, civilianclothed members of the service and accommodated in a special WAAF
maternity hostel right up until the time of conﬁnement. This hostel
would offer pre-natal care and instruction in ‘mothercraft’. The provision of such an establishment, asserted Harris, would not only mitigate
some of the practical problems of disposal, but also ‘indicate a fuller
appreciation of the moral issues at stake, and reﬂect greater credit upon
the Service than does the present policy of disassociation and
discharge’.98
The Air Ministry, however, was not inclined to agree with
Harris. The views of the WAAF hierarchy were sought – one of whose
staff ofﬁcers dismissed Bomber Command’s suggestions as ‘guided more
by sentiment than by practical common sense’99 – and his proposals
were rejected. It was maintained that the Ministry of Health was the
body responsible for the care of pregnant women and that the RAF
medical service should not take over this function; that the problems
facing unmarried mothers were better handled by experienced civilian
welfare workers; and that such a hostel would inevitably bring opprobrium on the WAAF and ‘lay the Services open to the accusation that
they are making illegitimacy attractive and easy and encouraging
immorality’. It was considered that the policy in place was sound and
that ‘the remedy of disclosing her condition lies in the airwoman’s own
hands’.100 Harris was forced to accept this ruling but retorted that ‘I
much regret that the change of policy which I proposed . . . is regarded as
unacceptable.’101

8 OFF DUTY
Recreational Activities
In the ATS and the WAAF, servicewomen not on duty were
normally required to spend one evening each week in their camps or
billets. This was known as a ‘barrack night’ or a ‘domestic night’
and was generally used for such chores as cleaning quarters, washing
underwear, sewing stockings, pressing skirts and polishing shoes.1
Some female personnel resented this intrusion on their free time and
wondered why their male counterparts seemed to escape such an
inconvenience.2 Nevertheless, these evenings could become lively
affairs. Eileen McMurdo recalled that the ‘characters’ in her ATS
billet would oblige the auxiliaries with a ‘turn or two’ as they
huddled over their darning needles or queued up for the temperamental electric iron:
One of these was Vicki who would entertain us with her ‘raw
recruit act.’ Dressed in an assortment of our uniforms, overlarge
jacket and skimpy skirt, army issue bloomer legs hanging well
down below her knees and with a hat rammed down over her
eyes she would proceed to ‘take the mickey’ out of everything
the ATS held sacred in the broad accent of her native
Plymouth.3
To members of the RAF, the WAAF ‘domestic night’ took on the
mystique of a curious female ritual. One male ofﬁcer wrote of ‘that

1::79

.

142 / Off Duty
evening on which the WAAF are kept in barracks and foregather for
reasons which, other than the mending of “smalls”, are wrapped in
mystery more profound than freemasonry’. The RAF corporal on gate
duty at his base termed it the women’s ‘conﬁnement night’.4
When they were not engaged in these domestic tasks, servicewomen participated in a wide range of leisure activities in their off-duty
hours. Some whiled away the time simply reading, writing letters, knitting, or chatting to friends in the forces.5 For Dorothy Calvert, these
casual interactions with her ATS hut mates demonstrated both the
diversity and solidarity of the group:
I found it very fascinating, that in such a small Island we could
all speak some kind of English, and yet all sound so different.
I always liked to listen to the girls who came from wealthy
parents, speaking in their Eton collar and top hat way, and yet
they were the same as the rest of us, only when they swore, or
sang bawdy songs, it sounded a lot more daft. Then perhaps we
English would have to gang up against the Scots, when they
were having a ‘We hate England’ day. We would say ‘Sod off
back to Scotland then, we can manage without you.’ These
spates [sic] would last a few minutes, then the Welsh girl
would say something in her own tongue, which could have
been anything, and we would forget the spate and fall about
laughing . . . Taking all in all, we really got on famously, not
Angelic, just normal.6
Others were more active in their leisure time. A number, for example,
participated in education schemes laid on for the services. According to
one participant at RAF Ternhill, these could inspire some animated
discussions:
Let me take you along to the Education Block at 2015 hours one
Thursday to have a peep at the Group in Session. The subject for
tonight is ‘AREN’T MEN BEASTS’ and LACW [Leading
Aircraftswoman] Prince, BEM, who is of the opinion that they
are, is going to try and bring the Group round to her way of
thinking. Difﬁdently she mounts the rostrum, for it is her ﬁrst
appearance, and puts forward a reasonable, sound argument in
support of her case. Many hardened ‘discussers’ are seen taking
copious notes which will form the basis of the many arrows they

1::79

are going to sling at her later. The very able Group Leader then
declares the subject open for discussion and the fun begins . . .
‘Women’s place is in the home’ declares one speaker.
‘Not at all’ replies another, hard on his heels. ‘Let her work
outside if she wants to.’
Back and forth the ball is ﬂung from airmen to airwomen,
from ofﬁcer to NCO . . .
At 2300 hours, the Group Leader has to bring the meeting to
a close as the lights are liable to go off at any moment.
Reluctantly we drag ourselves away from the Discussion Group
and wend our way to our various messes, still arguing hotly.7
On other occasions these events needed different billing. It was reported
that when one civilian lecturer spoke to an ATS audience on the topic of
‘Prospects for Poland’ the talk ‘failed dismally’. Yet when the same
lecture was advertised to another ATS unit under the title of ‘Would
you marry a Pole?’ the ensuing discussion was said to have been ‘lively in
the extreme’.8 Female personnel also took part in various sports.9 Lois
Goossens of the ATS played in a mixed hockey match against the
soldiers, but the referee had to curtail it as ‘the men played dirty by
bashing us with their sticks and tripping us up’.10 In contrast, Edith Kup
of the WAAF participated in a corresponding game against the airmen
and ‘since they were too gentlemanly to play too hard, we beat them
hollow’.11 Amateur theatricals were another pastime. Janet Sykes of the
ATS took to the stage in a review for her mixed searchlight battery and
sang ‘The Last Time I Saw Paris’ so badly that ‘the memory embarrasses
me still’.12 More daringly, Claire Lowry of the WRNS performed
a high-kicking ‘Tiller Girls’ routine at a naval concert that was ‘much
appreciated by the matelots’.13 The cinema was an additional attraction. During the weekly ﬁlm shows at Lilian Bader’s RAF station ‘whenever the hero embraced his loved one there would be loud Donald Duck
sounds from the men and indignant shushes from us girls’.14
Dances were a further recreation for servicewomen. In Doris
Hatcher’s mess dining room a notice would be posted up asking for
quotas of Wrens to sign up for dances at nearby British military
bases: ‘Trucks used to come from different army camps and pick us
up – “passion trucks”, as they were called.’15 On occasion, complications of rank and gender might arise. Molly Gale, a regimental sergeant major in the ATS, was regularly asked onto the dance ﬂoor by

male other ranks during the Saturday-night dances at her Royal
Artillery training camp: ‘I knew when it had been a bet by the
whistles from his mates as we circled the ﬂoor. I usually asked if
I shared the bet.’16 If civilian women were present, feminine rivalries
could surface. ‘We are not allowed to wear “civvies” on the camp’,
complained airwoman Josette Demey, ‘and we feel very much at our
disadvantage towards those civilian factory girls who come to dance
with “our” RAF boys.’17 Indeed, when female personnel were
authorised to attend dances out of uniform there was invariably
a desire to don something more glamorous. Whilst stationed at
Wilton House near Salisbury, Eileen McMurdo’s ATS signallers
were invited to a dance in the local town hall at which fancy dress
was to be permitted as a ‘special treat’:
The one stipulation made by our commanding ofﬁcer was that
we would wear either a bona-ﬁde fancy dress or our uniforms
but that dance or party dresses would not be allowed. Nothing
daunted, many of the girls sent home for their evening ﬁnery
1::79

and there was much wracking of brains as they tried to think of
some effective way of converting them into fancy dress.
On the night of the dance the majority of us played it safe and
stuck to our uniforms but a few of the hardier element turned up
at the Town Hall looking very chic and attractive even if it
wasn’t easy to tell where the evening dress ended and fancy
dress began . . . .
The most blatantly thin ‘disguise’ of all was a long, ﬂowing
white gown worn by one of the signal ofﬁce staff which
appeared without any extra adornment at all. The only slight
concession the wearer made to the occasion was a small wreath
of artiﬁcial laurel leaves nestling precariously and practically
invisibly amongst her upswept hair. She announced that she had
come as ‘Peace in our time.’18
When the US forces arrived in Britain, invitations to dances at their
bases tended to be especially sought after. Not only was the dancing
lively – Waaf Joyce Taylor was ‘shaken and shocked but nevertheless
pleasurably excited’ by her American dance partner’s jitterbug19 – but
also the abundant food provided for the female guests seemed like
manna from heaven in heavily-rationed wartime Britain.20
Drinking in pubs and bars was an added means of relaxation
for women in the forces.21 For some, this was a novel – if somewhat
disconcerting – experience. Joan Zeepvat entered a public house for
the ﬁrst time on a night out in Wrexham with an ATS colleague and
two sappers and was cajoled into imbibing a pint of Welsh lager: ‘I
don’t know how I managed to swallow it. It tasted like the Bitter
Alloes that the teacher used to have on her desk to stop us biting our
nails.’ Thoroughly tipsy, she travelled back to her camp recumbent in
the overhead luggage rack of a train: ‘Not a drop of Welsh Lager has
ever passed my lips again.’22 Others took to alcohol rather better.
WAAF ofﬁcer Frances Stone was persuaded to participate in
a ‘schooner race’ between RAF ofﬁcers at her air base and discovered,
much to her surprise, that she was able to drain a tankard of beer in
double quick time: ‘I could only imagine that the fact that I had had
my tonsils removed when I was at College made me able to drink so
quickly.’ Thereafter, she was regularly asked to challenge male newcomers to down a pint in the mess bar: ‘I was never beaten, but much
later an RAF ofﬁcer in Fighter Command produced a dead heat.’23

A few participated in more unruly behaviour. ‘Those ATS girls are
a disgrace’, thundered one member of the public in Chester. ‘They
come into this pub at night and line up against that wall. Soldiers give
them drinks and then when they’re blind drunk they carry them out
into the street. And we’re paying public money for them too.’24
Elsewhere, Joan Wyndham described the alcohol-fuelled revelries
she enjoyed with her fellow WAAF plotters at a RAF station near
Preston:
The highspots of our social life are pub parties given by the girls
in our Mess, which usually turn out to be Babylonian orgies.
Pandora, Oscar [ine] and I are not very good at these affairs
where everybody kisses everybody else, no matter how repulsive. We eat and drink our way steadily through the 1/6d. worth
we put into the kitty and look neither to right nor left. Gussy is
a much better mixer, and she can also play piano – ‘Love’s Old
Sweet Song’ on piano keys awash with beer. After the party the
scene at the bus stop usually beggars description, WAAFs collapsing and being sick in the road, airmen peeing against the
wall, couples rolling in the grass. Last time Pandora was sick all
night from the pork pies.25
The military authorities were sensitive to the off-duty activities of
servicewomen and on occasion intervened in order to protect what
Gerard DeGroot has termed their ‘feminine virtue’.26 In the WAAF,
for instance, there were concerns about excessive consumption of alcohol among airwomen and, whilst heavy drinking was common among
RAF aircrew and even indulged by senior commanders,27 guidance on
this issue was circulated to female ofﬁcers:
The habitual taking of alcohol should be discouraged. While it
should be appreciated that many women in the Service have
been accustomed in the past to temperate indulgence in alcohol
without undesirable repercussions, a danger arises in the case of
the young recruit who is a stranger to alcohol, but who may be
led astray by older and more sophisticated companions. The
ofﬁcer should be on the lookout for this and can often, by
changing hours of work and barrack huts, break up undesirable
associations.28

147 / Recreational Activities
In the ATS, there was a particular anxiety about the ‘bad impression’
created by auxiliaries smoking in public places. In the view of the DATS,
Leslie Whateley, ‘such habits looked unattractive and unfeminine in
civilian clothes, and in uniform worse’. Her ﬁrst impulse was to deal
with the matter informally by word of mouth. However, she allowed
herself to be overruled by her senior ofﬁcers and, in the spring of 1944,
issued a written instruction that auxiliaries must not smoke in public
when in uniform.29 This prohibition included whilst walking on the
streets, travelling on buses, queuing for the cinema or browsing in
shops.30 The order soon came to the attention of MPs who raised it in
the House of Commons. Emanuel Shinwell, the Labour MP for
Easington, wondered why there should be ‘discrimination between
men and women in the Forces as regards smoking’ and enquired
whether it would not be better for the government to ‘get on with the
war, instead of indulging in these pettifogging regulations?’ The
Secretary of State for War, Sir James Grigg, sought to explain the
rationale behind the directive, but was clearly discomforted by the
predicament he had been put in. He argued that this order – which in
fact ampliﬁed a ‘no-smoking on the streets’ clause in the 1941 ATS
regulations that had obviously fallen into abeyance – sought to ensure
that ‘the appearance of the auxiliaries did credit to their Service’, yet
acknowledged that ‘whether this object can best be secured by detailed
instructions, or by relying on the good sense of the auxiliaries is a matter
of opinion’.31 Although Whateley’s order continued to stand, she was
contrite: ‘I certainly learnt my lesson never to go back on my ﬁrst
inclination.’32 Penny Tinkler has suggested that this no-smoking episode was redolent of the fragile ‘respectability’ of women in uniform.33
The question of contact between white servicewomen and black
American servicemen also arose. As David Reynolds has related, the
War Ofﬁce preferred not to put much in writing on this subject because
of its sensitivity, but indicated that members of the ATS should have
minimal interaction with black GIs.34 Yet this did not prevent local
army commanders from issuing their own instructions. One senior
ofﬁcer in Southern Command advised that ‘white women should not
associate with coloured men’ and should not ‘walk out, dance, or drink
with them’.35 Likewise, Mary Lee Settle recollected that during her
WAAF basic training the new recruits were told by the female ‘admin’
ofﬁcer that she ‘absolutely forbid’ them to be seen talking to black
American soldiers. But this did not go down well with all those present.

‘She’s not fucking well going to tell me oo to see!’, Settle overheard one
Waaf mutter to another.36 This wartime hostility to interracial relationships was an aspect of what Wendy Webster has termed ‘sexual
patriotism’.37
Meanwhile, higher authority could ﬁnd itself drawn into efforts
at damage control in regard to women’s off-duty activities. In the
summer of 1942, an article appeared in The New York Times, under
the headline ‘US Soldier Spanks Mary Churchill as Retort to Jest Over
His Big Feet’, which recounted the events at an ATS party in London at
which the Prime Minister’s daughter, who had just been promoted to
sergeant, was said to have been put over the knee of Private Bill ‘Feets’
Adams of Grand Rapids, Michigan, who ‘paddled’ her for making fun
of his size 14EE service shoes (the largest issued by the US army: ‘a shade
smaller than Clipper Pontoons’). The assailant, it was reported, ‘did not
think of the incident as a matter of applied democracy – it just seemed
a natural thing to do at the time’.38 Downing Street ofﬁcials got wind of
the story and the Ministry of Information was consulted as to whether
steps should be taken to prevent its publication in the British newspapers, in order to forestall the episode having ‘a discouraging effect on
mothers of possible recruits for the ATS’. It was, however, considered
that any such action might simply draw attention to the story, which
apparently had not been widely circulated, and the matter was allowed
to rest.39

Beauty Rituals
Regardless of their roles with the armed forces, many servicewomen spent part of their spare time undertaking beauty rituals of one
type or another. Regulations were drawn up to govern their appearance
when in uniform. They included the stipulations that hair was to be
‘neat’ and worn ‘off the collar’, that make-up, if used, should be ‘discreet’ and that nail varnish must not be ‘highly coloured’.40 But these did
not prevent female personnel from going to considerable lengths to
enhance their looks. As Pat Kirkham has commented, ‘women in uniform took beauty and duty just as seriously as their civilian sisters’.41
There were, for example, night-time beauty rituals. In Kathleen
Cove’s WAAF hut, the scene before lights out was invariably of ‘girls in
varying stages of undress, sitting on their beds putting their hair in
curlers’.42 One of Joan Zeepvat’s ATS room-mates inserted so many

149 / Beauty Rituals
hairpins that they covered her head ‘like a metal bonnet’.43 There were
also morning rituals. Pamela Brisley-Wilson’s regular wake-up routine
in the WAAF was to ‘freshen my face with cotton wool and a mixture of
rose water and witch hazel and then apply my face cream and lipstick
and rouge’.44 Barbara Rhodes found that her WRNS navy blue uniform
was prone to smudging with make-up and face powder whilst dressing
for duty so ‘we nearly all left our skirts and jackets off until we had
attended to our hair and complexions’.45 In preparation for social
events, the beauty process intensiﬁed. ‘Like all girls,’ reported one
Waaf, ‘there’s a tremendous pride in appearance. When we went to
a dance last week, some girls spent the entire afternoon titivating
themselves.’46 If for some reason beauty accessories were in short supply, this could cause a tremor in the ranks. ‘Undoubtedly, the worst
thing of all,’ admitted Marjorie Hazell after her kitbag and those of her
fellow Waafs had been mislaid among the baggage of a Guards regiment
during a train journey to a new RAF camp, ‘was the loss of our hair
curlers and make-up.’47 It was reported by one airwoman that ‘all told,

more make up is used in, than out of the WAAF’.48 A wartime observer,
Peggy Scott, put this enhanced concern for appearance in the services
down to ‘a different femininity’: ‘It is not merely to attract men but
because they think more of themselves. Doing men’s work and being
treated as mates by the men has given the girls a better sense of their own
value.’49
Inevitably, some stepped over the boundaries of what was
considered decorous. Claire Lowry’s unruly ‘wavy bob’ and penchant
for brilliant lipstick and bright nail varnish resulted in regular trouble
with her WRNS ofﬁcers: ‘Called to the Ofﬁce, suitably immaculately
attired, with my hair rolled up around my head, and wearing the
minimum of make-up, I would stand on the square of carpet, to be
thoroughly told off.’50 Yet in other regards, the military authorities
seemed willing to collaborate in these beauty endeavours. In the ATS
and WAAF, hairdressing salons were established at bases where there
were large concentrations of servicewomen.51 In the WRNS, a lecture
was given to Wrens by a former employee of Elizabeth Arden on ‘the
correct way to wear makeup with uniform’.52 And in the ATS, a sleek
khaki shoulder bag was issued to auxiliaries that they used as
a receptacle for their cosmetics when off duty (gas mask cases having
previously fulﬁlled this purpose).53 In fact, Martin Francis has suggested that there was a belief that the presence of attractive airwomen
at RAF stations could give a positive lift to the spirits of hard-pressed
male aircrew.54 One Czech Spitﬁre pilot, Miroslav Liskutin, was so
captivated by the WAAF parachute packers at RAF Catterick that he
wondered if someone had handpicked ‘a team of beauty queens, to
help with the morale’.55

Romances with Servicemen
Military life invariably offered unattached servicewomen (and,
no doubt, some attached as well) plenty of opportunities for romantic
interludes with male colleagues during their off-duty hours. At Christian
Lamb’s naval fort ‘we were all longing to fall in love’.56 In Edna Smith’s
mixed anti-aircraft battery ‘there were lots of romances . . . it was
natural’.57 At Marjorie Hazell’s aircraft maintenance unit ‘everybody
paired off . . . There were no spare girls.’58 ‘In the forces’, conﬁrmed
Waaf Joan Arkwright, ‘a boyfriend seems to be one of the necessities of
life.’59

Female personnel could, however, be discriminating in their
choice of men, especially when there were plenty of eligible ones to
choose from. This was well illustrated in a report drawn up for Mass
Observation on the love life of Waafs. Compiled by Aircraftswoman
Nina Masel (who before joining up had been a paid investigator for
MO), and entitled ‘The Great Digby Man-Chase’, it provided
a candid commentary on the attributes that she and her fellow
plotters at RAF Digby looked for in their service boyfriends, as
well as the ruthlessness of the ‘hunt’:
The main consequence of a lot of women living together seems
to be that, since everyone realizes that everyone else’s emotions,
aims and actions are similar to their own – conventional barriers
and restraint are torn down, and conversation gets down to
bedrock.
The presence of both sexes always imposes restraint in conversation. The soldier’s fumbling excuse for hard swearing is
always: ‘Oh, well, when a lot of us lads get together . . . ’
Similarly, when women are together in our circumstances, we
use words which we wouldn’t think of ‘bringing out in public’.
Not only in choice of words, but also in choice of topic and
depth of discussion, is this new candour created. Even at
women’s tea-parties, where the other sex is excluded, women
are on their guard against each other, and don’t admit their
basic feelings . . . But here, we’ve got to know each other well;
we’re all in the same boat and we’re all after the same thing. So
why kid each other?
And what is this thing we’re all after? Obviously, a man.
Preferably an ofﬁcer or a sergeant-pilot. I should say that 85%
of our conversation is about men, dances (where we meet men),
etc, etc; 15% about domestic and shop matters; and a negligible
percentage on other matters.
But to get a man is not sufﬁcient. It’s easy to get a man; in fact
it’s difﬁcult not to. Competitive factors in the Great Man-Chase
are under the following headings . . .
1. Quality: The decisive qualities are rank; wings; looks; money;
youth; in that order.
Rank is unbelievably important. There’s a Wing-Commander
here whose only redeeming features is that he’s young. He isn’t

1::79

good-looking; he’s owned to be a great bore; and he’s extremely
‘fast’ – (which is not a recommendation, see later). Yet he could
go out with any woman on the station he cared to ask; no one
would refuse. And all this rests purely on his 3 rings and wings.
‘My dear’, Dorothy, his favourite conﬁded in me, ‘he’s
a dreadful bore – you chat away and all he says is ‘yes’ or ‘no’
and you’re left wondering what to say next. And honestly, to be
quite frank – although it’s a dreadful thing to say – I honestly
wouldn’t dream of going out with him if he wasn’t a Wing-Co.’
The height of sex-rank is commission plus wings (higher
commission the better). Sergeant-pilots and groundcommissions tie for second place. This includes army ofﬁcers.
Ground stripes come a poor third. For the rest, as far as most
Ops. girls are concerned, there is little hunting-value.
In the term ‘looks’, I include charm, personality, etc. This
counts only as a narrow comparison, viz: P/O [Pilot Ofﬁcer] A is
better than P/O B, because he is more charming, but we’d rather
go out with P/O B, who is not charming, than with Sergeant
C who is (and he’s good looking, too).
Members of the army without commissions don’t get a look
in at all . . .
2. Quantity: Naturally, the more men one can fasten to one’s
train, the more prestige one gains in the Chase.
3. Intensity: A deliberately vague term, embodying length of
affair, seriousness of affair, extent of ardour, and its
manifestations.
Of course, the longer you can keep your man, the higher up
you are in the competition. It’s better if he’s madly in love with
you. He shouldn’t be seen in public with other women. And
telegrams, chocolates, cigarettes, and really ‘classy’ evenings
out all put you a step higher on the ladder.
As far as physical manifestations are concerned, the average
operations girl admittedly likes a man who can kiss well, eyes
‘wandering’ with suspicion, and deﬁnitely abstains from actual
immorality. Technique in kissing is of ﬁrst importance.
Thus:
‘Norman’s a dear, but so inexperienced. When he kisses me,
nine times out of ten he misﬁres.’

Or,
‘There’s one thing about Allen. He does know how to kiss.’
Or,
‘I felt really hurt. He saw me all the way back to the billet, and
then just shook hands with me.’
Further than kissing is not eyed favourably:
‘I like Bill, and he is a Squadron-Leader and all that, but
I simply can’t face the coping I have to do every evening.’
(‘Coping’ having become the accepted term for dealing with
unwanted passion.)
So the most eligible men are those who kiss well, but ‘know
when to stop’.
In summary, the best position to be in is to have lots of
winged ofﬁcers of high rank, young, with plenty of money,
sending telegrams and cigarettes regularly, falling violently in
love with you for a long time, preferably good-looking and
amusing.
What is all this for?
It seems to me that practically the entire object of this Chase is
a matter of vanity and prestige. It is nice to ﬁnd that so many
desirable men are attentive to one. It is even nicer to prove this
to others, by appearing with various escorts at all public
functions.
Becoming, of necessity, subjective: – I allowed myself to drift
into this Chase for the past few months and have discovered:
(a) that I am happiest when I am conducting two or three
successful affairs with eligibles as above,
(b) that I am second happiest when I am pretending to other
girls that they are successful affairs as above,
(c) that the moment I’d ‘hooked my man’, it gave me great
pleasure to appear at dances with him, in front of my
friends, particularly if they were unescorted,
(d) that one of the most triumphant moments of my life
occurred when a telegram arrived for me, in the mess,
from a very high rank ofﬁcer. My immediate reaction
was: ‘Thank God this arrived in the mess, in front of
them all, and not in the billet. That would have been
a waste!’

I have reason to believe that these reactions are fairly
typical . . .
A girl on our control had been trying very hard to get a date
with a new ofﬁcer. She was sitting next to him in the Ops.
Room, one day, full of concentration in her conversation,
when suddenly she smiled, looked across at me, and mouthed
the words: ‘Got him!’60
The attraction of ofﬁcer-aircrew was corroborated by other Waafs. Joan
Wyndham admitted that at station dances ‘everyone [was] hoping to get
off with a pilot’:
The sergeants’ Mess Hall was hung with balloons and streamers
left over from Christmas and a rather ropy band was playing on
the platform. As we strolled in to the strains of ‘Deep Purple’ it
seemed that all the men were about ﬁve feet tall. Soon we were
whirling around the room clasped to the amorous bosoms of
these pint-sized Romeos, dreaming all the time of our ideal,
a mythical character whom we have christened Squadron
Leader the Hon. Anthony Ashley-Dukes. Any minute now, we
felt, he would swan in, so weighted with ‘gongs’ that he could
hardly stand up, and sweep us off our feet. Meanwhile we have to
put up with the sweaty embraces of these ‘wingless wonders’. The
very worst thing about being at a Filter Command is that there
are no pilots! I can’t describe the effect wings have on a WAAF.
Our theme song should really be ‘If I Only Had Wings’.61
Elsewhere, the romantic impulses of servicewomen could lead to more
speculative assignations. Eileen McMurdo recalled that on slack Sunday
mornings she and her fellow ATS other ranks would sometimes engage
in telephone ﬂirting whilst manning the army switchboards:
It was during one of those quiet Sunday shifts that Mollie,
a newcomer to Southern Command, got into conversation
with Captain Casey. He had one of those attractive ‘dark
brown’ voices and most of us had at some time or other passed
a Sunday morning in conversation with him. Mollie was
obviously quite captivated and was having a long, cosy chat as
the rest of us sat reading our papers but gradually as she began
making arrangements to meet him that evening, we put down
our papers and gave her side of the conversation our full and

undivided attention. When she had twittered her ﬁnal ‘goodbye’
she turned to ﬁnd us watching her, grinning delightedly.
‘Well, well, well!’ someone remarked. ‘What do you know! –
She’s got a date with our Captain Casey! What have you got
that we lesser beings lack?!’
Mollie was a small pert blonde from London and although
she hadn’t been with us for long we had gathered that there
wasn’t a lot she didn’t know about most things. She took our
ribbing and friendly interest with amused tolerance wanting to
know as much as possible about Captain Casey. As she hadn’t
yet actually met him ‘in the ﬂesh’ as it were, we willingly
supplied a few details.
Mollie and I bunked in the same room so I was on hand that
evening as she was getting ready for her dinner engagement at
the ‘White Hart’.
‘I told him what I’d be wearing so that he’d spot me right
away,’ she said, pouring herself into a tightly ﬁtting red corduroy suit. I agreed that in that outﬁt he’d spot her without any
trouble at all, asking if she didn’t think it just a bit risky making
a ‘blind date.’ By this time several other members of the shift
had drifted into our room and were sitting around watching her
preparations.
‘Risky?’ she asked. ‘After what you crowd told me about him
this morning? And that gorgeous voice too! Come off it girls –
Cut out the sour grapes!’ and with one ﬁnal approving glance at
her reﬂection in the mirror, she was off.
Although Mollie had started ﬁrst, she’d had to make one or
two detours around the area of the billets giving the ofﬁcers
quarters and company ofﬁce a wide berth to avoid the risk of
being seen leaving in forbidden civilian dress. We had already
reached the ‘White Hart’ and were sitting at various strategic
points around the lounge as she made her entrance.
She swept through the revolving doors and stood poised,
short musquash jacket draped casually around her shoulders
as she looked about her with a faintly eager and speculative eye.
The tall lean ﬁgure of Captain Casey unfolded itself from one
of the armchairs and he strode across to meet her, hand
outstretched.

We had told Mollie quite a bit about Captain Casey that
morning. We had told her about his large country house in
Surrey and of his leisurely pre-war life as a country squire,
shooting and riding to hounds, etc. What we had omitted to
mention was the fact that his fame as a ‘wolf’ was renowned
amongst the ATS of Southern Command, that he was fast
approaching sixty, was as bald as an egg and the unfortunate
possessor of a set of the whitest of white, ill-ﬁtting porcelain
dentures which ‘clicked’ very distinctly at intervals as he talked.
We had also forgotten to mention that he was known throughout command either as ‘Old baldy’ or ‘Castanets Casey,’ in
honour of his teeth.
As we watched, they crossed to the bar for a pre-dinner drink
and Mollie managed to tear her fascinated gaze away from the
ﬂashing porcelain for just long enough to cast us a venomous
look as we sat innocently sipping our drinks.
We were waiting in a body for her at the billets when she
sneaked in at the back door to change into uniform before
signing in.
She used one or two choice London expressions as she told us
precisely what she thought of us and our mean, lowdown tricks.
At last, running out of steam, she ﬁnished indignantly, ‘I can
imagine what any of you would have felt if you had been
confronted by that dream of delight!’
There was a yell of laughter at this and it was some time
before we could compose ourselves sufﬁciently to explain our
hilarity.
Firstly, we apologised for not telling her all the fascinating
details about Captain Casey but that we just couldn’t resist the
temptation.
‘We felt we were entitled to see the fun in a way,’ someone
concluded. ‘No one can ever resist that gorgeous voice of his
and, when we were new to “Command,” most of us made
a blind date to meet ‘old baldy’ in the lounge at the White
Hart!’
I think she felt a little better about the whole episode after we
had welcomed her to the ‘Casey Club’, but we noticed that it
was a long time before she could face answering his extension
when he called, particularly on a nice, lazy Sunday shift.62

157 / Romances with Servicemen
Sometimes female desire went unrequited. Dorothy Calvert related that
on her anti-aircraft gun site one other rank was so smitten with a young
male ofﬁcer that she followed him around like a love-sick puppy and
‘when he came near her on duty, she would pass out’. He, however,
wanted nothing to do with her and ‘no matter what anyone said to her,
she just did not grasp the fact’. Eventually, she had to be posted away
‘before someone did something desperate’.63
The romantic entanglements of service life did raise issues for
the military authorities. The question of female other ranks and male
ofﬁcers having relationships with one another was one such matter. In
the armed forces it was not regarded as conducive to good military
discipline for commissioned and non-commissioned ranks to cavort
together off-duty, so inter-rank affairs tended to be frowned upon.64
This did not, however, as we have seen, prevent couples from pursuing
such romances. Janet Sykes of the ATS would, for example, cycle miles
out into the countryside to meet her troop commander boyfriend to
avoid being seen together publicly: ‘it was a strange courtship’.65 Joyce
Greaves’s ofﬁcer-pilot lover would dress himself up as a sergeant in
order to accompany her to WAAF dances: ‘you did all kind of crazy
things like that and got away with it’.66 Frances Annett and her companions in the WRNS were regularly smuggled into a nearby dockyard by
their naval ofﬁcer beaus on the ﬂoors of taxis: ‘I had many a dinner and
evening on board a destroyer this way.’67 Indeed, it seems that Wrens, of
whatever rank, often adorned parties in the ofﬁcers’ wardrooms whilst
ships were in port. Anne de Courcy stated that ‘a good-looking Wren
was always welcome, whether lower deck or ofﬁcer’.68
These inter-rank relationships become the subject of discussion
in the Air Ministry. Complaints were made from within the RAF that
some of its commanders were more liberal than others with regard to
their attitudes towards off-duty relationships between RAF ofﬁcers and
WAAF other ranks and that the divergence of practice was leading to
discontent. This included ‘suspected favouritism by RAF ofﬁcers, and
consequent jealousy among airwomen’; ‘resentment among airmen that
airwomen of corresponding rank should be treated differently to themselves’; ‘familiarity of airwomen with RAF ofﬁcers undermining the
authority of the WAAF ofﬁcers and NCO’s’; ‘cases of airwomen who
do not wish to go out with RAF ofﬁcers but are doubtful of the consequences of refusal’; and ‘difﬁculties which arise when an RAF ofﬁcer

and airman both entertain similar sentiments towards the same
airwoman’.69
When Air Ministry ofﬁcials looked into this matter in 1943, the
War Ofﬁce view was said to be ‘to let sleeping dogs lie’, while the
Admiralty – by virtue of the fact that the WRNS was not subject to
the Naval Discipline Act and allowed its Wrens greater discretion to
wear civilian clothes off duty, which tended to camouﬂage the problem –
was thought not to ‘keep a dog at all’. Nevertheless, since male and
female personnel were so closely integrated on RAF stations, it was
resolved that the Air Ministry position ought to be clariﬁed.70 This
included the circulation of a letter to RAF commanders which laid
down that, while the ‘question of social intercourse’ between RAF and
WAAF personnel should be largely determined by ‘the edicts of common sense and good taste’, male ofﬁcers on a station should exhibit ‘the
same attitude and relationship towards airwomen as has always existed
between ofﬁcers and airmen’ and that
association off the station between Royal Air Force ofﬁcers and
airwomen who belong to the same station should in normal
circumstances be avoided, particularly in the immediate vicinity
of the station and, where considered necessary in the interests of
the Service, should be prohibited.71
Despite these impediments, RAF romances continued to bloom across
the ranks. As Eric Taylor observed, ‘most sweethearts found ways
round the regulations, and “sleeping dogs” were allowed to rest
undisturbed’.72
Another concern was the sexual behaviour of women in the
forces with their service boyfriends (of whatever rank). Some female
personnel undoubtedly exploited the abundance of available men to
satisfy their desires. WAAF ofﬁcer Edith Kup, for example, recorded
disapprovingly that at her RAF station ‘the sigs [signals] girl was
vastly oversexed and a menace to the boys, who used to come to us
for protection from her. We called her “Any Old Iron” amongst
ourselves and found her blatant behaviour very undigniﬁed to say
the least.’73 In similar terms, Dorothy Calvert wrote disparagingly of
an ATS ‘gunner’ who ‘had the morals of an alley cat, she literally took
on anyone. She was the sort that gave our service a bad name’.74 But
many seem to have practiced a good deal of self-restraint. ‘The Great
Man Chase’, for instance, while highlighting the romantic

rapaciousness of plotter airwomen, also indicated that there were
limits to the physical intimacy they permitted within their relationships. This was corroborated by others. ‘I had lots of boyfriends’,
reminisced ATS ofﬁcer Judy Impie, ‘and I knew that if one of them
wanted to go farther than the usual kiss and cuddle, particularly
below the belt, instinct said no.’75 ‘There were those who did, and
those who didn’t’, recorded Joyce Sears of the WRNS. ‘ . . . Most of
the girls I knew were in the second category. There was a tendency to
close ranks against the others, when identiﬁed.’76 WAAF ofﬁcer
Felicity Ashbee conﬁrmed that ‘the fear of pregnancy kept a lot of
girls on the “straight and narrow”’ and that ‘a great many of them too
had been brought up to believe you should wait for “Mr Right”’.77
Calvert recalled that ‘narrow minded people thought that gun sites
were gloriﬁed “Knocking shops,” but they could not have been more
wrong’: ‘I for one had “kept my hand on my halfpenny,” as the old
saying goes, for twenty years, so I was hardly going to start ﬂashing it
around, as soon as I left home and put on a uniform.’78
The service authorities, however, did their best to keep their
women on the ‘straight and narrow’. The members of Lois Goossens’s
ATS unit were escorted to one local dance by a Corporal Trodd who
‘would have made an ideal prison wardress’. At the end of the evening,
she formed the auxiliaries up on the dance ﬂoor and marched them back
to their barracks like errant school girls: ‘We were furious and dreadfully embarrassed in front of all the men we had been dancing with.’79
Outside Nancy Walton’s WAAF billet, a line was painted around the
building which airmen were not permitted to step over when accompanying Waafs back to their quarters after a night out: ‘We would both
have been on a charge if we had crossed the line, as the WAAF NCOs
were very alert to the possibility.’80 At Vera Cole’s army camp, her ATS
ofﬁcer would search the buildings by torchlight after dances to ensure
that ‘none of us were doing anything likely to result in our being
dismissed from the Services under Para [11]’.81 In the WRNS, highlysexed Wrens could ﬁnd themselves under threat of expulsion from the
force. Although Vera Laughton Mathews admitted that ‘the day has
gone by when chastity was regarded as the only important virtue in
a woman’, she nevertheless believed that ‘the girl had to go out who
frankly thought nothing of promiscuity, and who when caught out
avowed that she had done no more than anyone else would have
done’. Her view was that

1::79

However much one believes in an equal standard of responsibility in sex matters between men and women, I cannot see how
it is possible to enforce equality of treatment in a Service, especially in war-time, when the results [possible pregnancy] are so
different.82
These temptations of the ﬂesh also came to feature on the Air Ministry
agenda. In 1943, as a result of anxiety about the incidence of VD and
illegitimate pregnancies among airwomen, particularly the eighteen to
twenty-year-olds, the WAAF hierarchy reﬂected on the moral probity of
their charges. It was contended that these lapses were by no means
conﬁned to women in the forces and were ‘a national problem’ brought
on by the circumstances of war. Nevertheless, it was surmised that the
‘emotional strain’ of working on operational airﬁelds, the consumption
of alcohol which led to ‘a certain amount of horse play’ and upset the
women’s ‘judgement’, and a lack of guidance from female ofﬁcers and
NCOs for ‘these young and high spirited girls who have left home at an
earlier age than is normal’, were contributory factors in cases of immorality in the service.83 It was further recognised that different codes of
propriety had to be applied to airwomen and airmen. In this regard,
there was an acknowledgment that even though ‘the standard of sexual
behaviour has altered greatly in the last generation, the fact remains that
loose behaviour in a woman is regarded more seriously than in a man’. It
was thus concluded that ‘while there should not normally be discrimination between men and women in the Service, in this particular question it is essential that the women in the Service should be judged by
a different standard from the men’.84
Steps were taken to stiffen the moral resolve of young airwomen. These included the provision of a lecture on ‘moral behaviour’
to WAAF ofﬁcer cadets and NCOs at their training schools and the
delivery of a similar talk to other ranks by ‘specially chosen’ female
ofﬁcers.85 Yet, as the WAAF authorities discovered, it was not always
easy to uphold high moral standards when the RAF itself was reluctant
to delve too closely into the private affairs of its airmen and airwomen.
As Constance Woodhead pointedly observed:
Although it was recognized early in the war that the WAAF was
an integral part of the RAF, the male service was curiously
hesitant to accept any responsibility for the moral relationship
between the two services. It is true that, here and there, station

1::79

161 / Romances with Servicemen
commanders accepted so much responsibility that they defeated
their own ends, since they tried to set barbed wire between the
men and women and prevent them meeting at all. In the main,
the onus for the maintenance of a high moral standard seemed
to be borne by the WAAF ofﬁcer, nor did she always receive as
much support in her efforts, from the RAF, as might have been
expected. A sincere, conscientious ofﬁcer, trying to look after
her airwomen, was sometimes even openly sneered at as an
interfering Mrs Grundy by RAF ofﬁcers who should have
known better.86
A similar point was made by Vera Laughton Mathews in relation to the
frivolous attitude of some naval ofﬁcers towards the WRNS:
In overwhelming numbers and often in very difﬁcult
conditions . . . [the Wrens] lived up to the high name and
reputation which they had themselves built for the Service.
It is not surprising that some fell by the wayside and the path
was not made easier by those senior naval ofﬁcers, happily only
few, who insisted on regarding the Wrens as borne for amusement purposes.87
Affairs with commanding ofﬁcers created particular complications.
Felicity Ashbee participated in a court of inquiry when it came to light
that the male CO of a remote RAF radar station in North Wales had
been ‘fancying around’ with his WAAF personnel. She admitted, however, to being mildly amused when taking evidence from the airwomen
concerned since they ‘had to describe what their Station Commander
had been getting up to, while at the same time avoiding giving the
impression that they were “ladies of easy virtue”’.88 She was less
amused to discover that her own station commander at RAF Stenigot
had casually dismissed a case of absence without leave which she had
remanded to him – a WAAF corporal who had been missing from camp
one night and refused to provide any explanation – since he was
involved in an extra-marital relationship with the accused. After failing
to take on board heavy hints from another of her female NCOs not to
remand the case, she cursed her naivety since ‘only two days ago, he was
assuring me he’d never been unfaithful to his wife’. All she could do was
hope that ‘the CO will restrain himself a bit more in future’.89

A further issue that came to light was a tendency on the part of
the parents of servicewomen to interfere in the latter’s military love life.
On occasion, this intervention could come from a parent within the
forces. Ursie Barclay’s mother was also her ATS company commander
and she kept a close watch on her daughter’s affections when Barclay
worked as a waitress in an army sergeants’ mess:
One day she found me sitting down having tea with the sergeants instead of waiting on them so she took me away quick –
she must have thought: ‘She’s obviously going to fall in love
with a sergeant’, and she wasn’t having that. So I was made
clerk to one of the ofﬁcers.90
More often, however, it came in the form of external approaches from
concerned parents. Despite a War Ofﬁce ruling that if ‘the happenings of
private life did not bring discredit on the Service, they were of no
concern to the military authorities’, Leslie Whateley recalled that, as
Deputy Director of the ATS, she regularly received requests from
mothers and fathers for interviews with her about their daughters’
unsuitable boyfriends:
Once again I came up against an instance of how a women’s
service differs from a male organization. It would be exceptional for parents to approach the War Ofﬁce about a son’s
romance, but I can remember many instances of distraught
parents visiting me and begging me to get some male member
of the forces (not necessarily of the Army) moved from the same
station as their daughter. On some occasions, when I was really
convinced that the case warranted it, I did re-post a daughter to
another unit. Only once in all these cases did I succeed in getting
the male authorities to take action from their side.91
Inevitably, a number of service romances resulted in marriage.
Arrangements were made, whenever possible, for married servicewomen to take periods of leave at the same time as their military
spouses,92 but the question also arose as to whether husbands and
wives should serve alongside each other in the forces. With regard to
the ATS, it was decreed that auxiliaries should not serve with their
spouses in the same unit, largely due to ‘difﬁculties in the exercise of
command’.93 In the WAAF, however, it was decided that airwomen
should be permitted to serve at the same base as their husbands, except

1::79

80

163 / Romances with Servicemen
in cases where one was an ofﬁcer and the other in the ranks.94 This was
also the position in the WRNS, with the proviso that there should not be
too big a disparity in rank between married naval and Wren ofﬁcers.95
Some mischievous couples were able to exploit these rather cumbersome
protocols for their own amusement. Airwoman Jean Edge, a waitress at
RAF Drem, was married to a senior ofﬁcer at nearby RAF Grangemouth
and, without divulging that they were man and wife, would wait on her
husband Paul in the ofﬁcers’ mess at Drem when he visited on ofﬁcial
business:
I was lucky in having a husband with a great sense of humour,
who did not mind in the least that I was ‘other ranks’ . . .
He was now a wing commander and frequently ﬂew to Drem
and dined with the station commander, Sir Archibald Hope,
known as ‘Sir Bald’ because he was. It was fun serving them
with their meals. On one occasion I could not resist putting
a glass of Guinness in front of Paul. This puzzled Sir Bald, and
Paul had to think quickly to explain its appearance without
revealing that I was his wife and knew what he liked to drink.96
Meanwhile, as a result of clothes rationing and a meagre allowance of
clothing coupons, many women in the forces were unable to get married
in traditional white dresses and often there was no alternative but to
walk down the aisle in their uniforms. This was said to be a constant
source of disappointment to them. In order to alleviate this, in 1944 the
ATS introduced a wedding dress service. Under this scheme, dresses
were donated to the War Ofﬁce by various philanthropic organisations
and public-spirited individuals – Barbara Cartland contributed over
seventy which she purchased through placing advertisements in such
society magazines as The Lady – and auxiliaries could arrange to
borrow a garment for their wedding day from a central pool. This
enterprise was subsequently extended to the other women’s services
and some ﬁfty dresses came to be in constant circulation.97
With service romances came heartbreak when a boyfriend or
husband was killed on active service. WRNS ofﬁcer, Betty Hodges, was
given the unenviable task of informing a fellow female ofﬁcer that her
husband had perished with his submarine crew: ‘It was such a dreadful
shock that at ﬁrst she thought I was playing some terrible trick on her.
“But Bobby can’t be dead, he can’t he can’t.” It was terrible to see, and
there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.’98 When one of Eileen

McMurdo’s ATS corporals, who was pregnant and shortly to be discharged, was told that her paratrooper husband, ‘Dear, quiet Bob’, had
been killed in Normandy, such was his wife’s distress that she was taken
by ambulance to the sick bay and suffered a miscarriage: ‘What adequate words are there to comfort a woman who had not only lost her
husband but also the baby to whom they had both been looking forward
to with such joy?’99 At Pip Beck’s RAF Bomber Command base, the
Waafs who were romantically attached to aircrew lived under the constant shadow of tragedy:

165 / Romances with Servicemen
There was another marriage – a girl in my billet. This was Jean,
who lived downstairs. Eighteen years old, 5 ft. nothing, with
a cloud of dark hair and dark eyes, a pale face and a sweet,
husky little voice. Her favourite song-of-the-moment was ‘Not
a Cloud in the Sky’, and we loved to hear her sing. Sitting by the
ﬁre in her room, one or other of us would beg her to sing it, and
if she shyly demurred we would cry, ‘Oh, go on!’ She usually
gave in, thinking no doubt of her Peter, as she crooned the
romantic words – [Sergeant] Peter Rix, a Rhodesian in P/O
[Pilot Ofﬁcer] Hackney’s crew.
After she returned from the short honeymoon leave they’d
had, two of us from the billet sat talking to her, and one,
unforgivably, asked, ‘What was it like, Jean – you know!’ Just
as bad, I listened, all ears. ‘Oh . . . ’ said Jean, embarrassed,
‘Well – I – I don’t know . . . I didn’t like it very much . . . ’ We
didn’t press for further details. Poor Jean – and poor Peter. In
less than two months she had lost him. Flying with F/Sgt. [Flight
Sergeant] Tetley, he didn’t come back from a trip to Dusseldorf.
She was paler still, with dark rings around her eyes, and
stunned. We never saw her cry. Neither did we hear her sing
again.100
Such tragedies could lead to superstition. In the RAF, Waafs who had
been romantically linked to a succession of dead ﬂyers became known as
‘chop girls’ and tended to be shunned by other airmen as bringing bad
luck.101 A wartime RAF medical ofﬁcer, Dr David Stafford-Clark,
observed the harmful effects this could have on the airwomen
concerned:
A young WAAF ofﬁcer who had lost two men friends in succession, both on operations, developed an acute depression with
considerable feelings of guilt in response to the rapidly accepted
verdict among the rest of the squadron that she was a jinx and
carried ‘the kiss of death’. This was not a grim joke; it was an
even grimmer belief, sincerely held; one Captain of Aircraft,
a Flight Lieutenant with DFC and bar, going so far as to forbid
any member of his crew to take her out, on pain of expulsion
from the crew. There was no point in adding to the risks, he
said.102

Eileen Smith recalled the silent anguish of one such ‘jinxed’ airwoman:
On more than one occasion she became engaged to a crew
member and the engagement ended sadly when her ﬁancé was
killed on a raid. On her bedside she had a few large studio
photos of these men and I would see the dim red glow of
a cigarette as she smoked into the early hours of the morning
trying to come to grips with the tragedies of war.103
Yet an airﬁeld romance might help to heal a damaged airman. Colin
‘Hoppy’ Hodgkinson, a RAF Spitﬁre pilot based at RAF Coltishall who
had lost his legs in a ﬂying accident shortly before the war but (like
Douglas Bader) had overcome his handicap to become an accomplished
wartime ﬂyer, had an intense, passing relationship with ‘Claire’,
a ‘goddess . . . thinly disguised as a WAAF ofﬁcer’. For Hodgkinson,
who had ﬂown almost a hundred operational sorties and was beginning
to feel the psychological strain, ‘it was ﬂattering for my ailing pride to be
the recognized cavalier of this pretty, witty, much sought-after woman’.
And, as he candidly admitted, ‘her acceptance of me as a companion
enormously helped to restore the masculine conﬁdence my disability
had undermined’.104

‘Anybody’s Meat’
Sexual harassment in the workplace spilled over into off-duty
hours. ATS ofﬁcer Margaret Egerton recounted that the army ofﬁcers in
one of her wartime messes, whom she termed ‘absolute shits’, would
‘say ﬁlthy things to embarrass me . . . [and] resented me largely because
I was a female . . . and because I wouldn’t respond to a pass’.105 At one
military base, some of the airwomen took to concealing hatpins in their
uniform lapels in order to fend off sexual assaults by servicemen in the
darkness of the camp cinema. ‘I had occasion to use mine’, recollected
a forearmed Waaf. ‘The lights came on when the airman screamed and
clutched his bottom. Everyone stared at me. After that I was known as
“the pin up girl”.’106 If the opportunity presented itself, prurient servicemen could adopt more voyeuristic methods of harassing their female
comrades. Barbara Littlejohn of the ATS recorded that a signalmen at
her intercept station at Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire, whose job it was
to stoke the boiler that served the auxiliaries’ bathroom, was discovered
to have rigged up a set of mirrors in the boiler room that allowed him to

spy on the women bathers: ‘He must have had an eyeful of every girl in
the camp before he was found out.’107 On other occasions, they would
leer at them suggestively on the streets. One male Royal Army Medical
Corps private admitted that
Whenever a girl, or a group of girls in uniform pass a group of
soldiers, the same actions can be observed, and the same words
can be overheard. All look at the approaching girls’ faces, smile,
look at the legs as they pass, end up by watching their behinds
waggle under the tight khaki skirts and generally pass the following jovial comments: ‘Not bad.. eh!’ ‘Nice bit of stuff mate.’
‘Not arf a bitch..’ ‘Look at her fucking arse!’ ‘Christ she’s a bit
of all right ain’t she?’ ‘Blood lousy’ . . . The comments vary with
the prettiness of the girls. Often there are shouts, and
laughter.108
American servicemen could also pose a sexual threat to members of the
women’s services. Social events at their military bases were invariably
lavish occasions, but sometimes there was a price to be paid. Bettine
Rose remembered one ATS dance she attended at a US aerodrome:
Most of the time was spent dodging the more undesirable types
of Yanks who were offering cartons of ‘Camels’ or silk stockings in exchange for a visit to their quarters. There seemed to be
no discipline from their ofﬁcers at all.109
Indeed, in May 1944, the MP for Grantham, Denis Kendall, complained
in the House of Commons that in his constituency women could not
walk unescorted through the town because of the inability of the US
military authorities to deal with the ‘improper behaviour of the
American forces and the complete failure to prevent unconcealed
immorality and to give proper protection to women’.110
The military authorities did take some preventative action to
protect servicewomen. The ‘Wrennery’ of Joan Dunhill and her fellow
landing craft maintenance Wrens was surrounded by barbed wire and
patrolled by a naval guard to secure it from an adjacent camp of sailors
and marines.111 WAAF clerk, Nancy Walton, and her female comrades
were given a course in self-defence at their camp in order to fend off
potential attackers.112 On the rare occasions that men and women were
forced to sleep in close proximity, special steps might be taken to
prevent any sexual assault. WAAF stenographer Olive Noble

reminisced that after having missed a train connection to the RAF Burns
Unit at Rauceby in Lincolnshire, and been left stranded at Grantham
station, she was taken in by a nearby army unit and given a bed for the
night in the all-male sergeants’ mess. She protested this was not the
‘done thing’ but an ofﬁcer re-assured her that a sentry would be posted
beside her bunk all night to ensure there was ‘no funny business’: ‘The
Guard was still standing there next morning when I awoke wondering
where on earth I was!’113
Yet it seems that in many cases servicewomen were simply left to
handle unwanted sexual advances as best they could. Some female
personnel became adept at fending off predatory servicemen. ATS driver, Win Dowd, utilised a number of psychological ploys when pestered
by US servicemen she encountered whilst walking home to her billet in
East Anglia:
My ﬁrst plot was the schoolmarm approach. They usually
opened with ‘Carry your bag, mam?’ ‘Why, thank you,
young man,’ I would reply, and hand over the case. That
was one hand accounted for. ‘And how are you liking
England? We do so appreciate your help over here.’ This
often got rid of them at the ﬁrst turning. ‘Have to turn off
here, mam. Nice to meet you, mam.’ When one fellow came
on a bit strong I tearfully told him that I had promised my
sailor boyfriend that I would wait for him. The GI tried
persuasion, telling me that with a war on we all had to take
our fun where and when it came. I still kept on about the boy
away at sea and our plans for when he came home. Eventually
he went very quiet, and when we reached the door of my billet
I found that he was in tears. He shook my hand in both of his,
lifted it to his lips and kissed it, spluttering: ‘I have a girl at
home and I would like to believe that she is acting just like
you.’ He didn’t know just how much I was acting.114
Sometimes more forceful action was required. ATS radar operator
Dorothy Calvert experienced several molestations whilst in the service
and fought back with considerable venom:
When we started from London the carriage was full, and we
were all having a very friendly chin wag, but as always had to
happen on long journeys, the carriages gradually emptied as

each person reached his destination. This happened on this
journey, which left one soldier, and me. As we had all been so
pally, I thought the rest of the journey would be uneventful; we
would just sit in a matey silence. I picked up my book and began
to read. Then suddenly this bloke, who was sitting opposite
leapt at me, pushing his hands up my skirt. I was absolutely
taken aback, but only for a moment. The lecherous little bugger,
he had been waiting to get me alone from the moment we got on
the train, getting more and more worked up.
Once again my ﬁghting blood was up, for as he bent over me
I hit him in the throat as hard as I could with the side of my
hand, and with my knees I knocked him right in the middle
stump, which was ready for a knock down. Well that stopped
his wind, and his gallop, as I shoved him on to his seat, groaning
and gasping. Then I got to my full ﬁve feet and stood over him,
and told him that if he so much as moved or blinked, that
I would bloody well kill him, and believe me I would have had
a jolly good try, but the brave lad sat without moving for the rest
of the journey.
These assaults left her with a strong sense of sexual treason:
The sad thing was, out of all the times that I was molested, it was
always one of our own servicemen. I often wondered who my
enemies were, and it ﬁlled me with anger and disgust that our
own men held us so low, just because we were in uniform. Did
they think that we were anybody’s meat, just for their enjoyment? One thing was very certain, to get through one’s service
stint ‘Virgo Intacta’ or in the same way as when you ﬁrst joined
up was almost impossible, and quite a challenge, but I suppose
that it was just another risk we had to run in war-time.115

‘A Special Problem’
For lesbian women, wartime military service offered opportunities to seek out others in the forces who shared their attraction to
members of the same sex. Vick Robson was posted to train as
a WAAF electrician at RAF Usworth and discovered a group of fellow
lesbians at the base: ‘I got in with some girls stationed there, and they

said “Are you like us?” So it started off again and I thought “Oh, I’m
back on Cloud Nine again”.’116 For heterosexual women, however,
the exposure to same-sex relationships in the services could come as
something of a shock. Margaret Herterich was left bewildered by an
incident she witnessed during her ATS anti-aircraft training at
Oswestry camp:
The only quarrel I heard the whole time that I was in the forces
happened here and was very strange and upsetting at the time. It
happened in the ablutions when all of a sudden one girl started
to scream and attack another girl. We all turned round and
heard the attacker screaming out, ‘Don’t touch her, she’s
mine, she’s mine. I love her.’ Two military police came in and
took her away. I was completely mystiﬁed until someone
explained that she was ‘a boy-girl’, and going to be discharged.
I still wasn’t much wiser!117
There were also cases of unwanted sexual advances from female colleagues. Eileen McMurdo described such an occurrence early in her ATS
career whilst living in a billet at Cosham near Fort Southwick:
As I turned over in my sleep I became drowsily aware that
someone was in bed beside me. It didn’t take many moments
for me to become very wide awake indeed to the realisation that
Barney was stretched out by my side, stark naked. I lay for
a moment stiff with shock as what I had at ﬁrst thought to be
a bad dream suddenly became reality. As my senses came fully
together I let out a yell as I leapt out of bed and headed for the
door. Before I could reach it, the door opened and standing on
the threshold was Amy, one of the shift corporals, who had the
room next to ours . . .
I stood shaking like a leaf; Amy put her arm around my
shoulders, calming me until gradually the shaking subsided.
Barney was sitting bolt upright in my bed with the blankets
pulled up under her chin as if to protect herself from my look of
shocked disbelief.
Amy glared across the room at her.
‘You! Get up! Get yourself into my room and wait there. I’ll
deal with you later!’ she snapped.

171 / ‘A Special Problem’
When Barney left the room I told Amy what had happened.
Still feeling sick with shock I whispered.
‘Her hands were like ﬁlthy black beetles crawling all over me.
I couldn’t believe it. I just couldn’t believe it. Not of Barney’.
Amy took me by the shoulders and gently shaking me she
said: ‘Poor little ‘un! They just don’t come any greener than you,
do they?! I’ve had my suspicions for some time that she’s . . .
[a lesbian] but I couldn’t say anything as I wasn’t one hundred
per cent sure. Anyway, I’ll make damned certain that she
doesn’t bother you again, you can be sure of that!’
She was true to her word. When I returned from duty at the
Fort a couple of days later Barney’s effects had been removed
from our room and shortly afterwards Barney left our Company
at Cosham: I presumed that she had been posted elsewhere but
I never could bring myself to enquire too closely.118
ATS ofﬁcer Margaret Egerton described a similar episode in the
Orkneys, in terms redolent of the stereotype of the manly lesbian:
Off the boat got this . . . man, with nicotine round her mouth,
kitbag over her shoulder and an Eton crop. You had to
censor letters in Orkney and it was obvious from hers that
she was a . . . [lesbian]. As a corporal, she messed with the
three male sergeants and would drink them under the table
every night.
Our lights went out at 11.00 pm and then you had a Tilley
lamp if needed. It was so cold I had eleven army blankets on my
bed. That night, through my dreams, I heard the distant sound
of revelry and it seemed to be getting nearer.
It stopped outside my door. In my half-asleep state I heard the
door being opened. It was this corporal, drunk as a coot. It was
pitch dark and I heard heavy breathing getting nearer, until she
bent over me. She stank of whisky.
‘It’s your turrrn tonight, ma’am,’ she growled. ‘It’s your

Then I came to. I said: ‘Get the hell out of here, Staff!,’ and
she went, leaving me thinking: What do I do in the morning? But
it was never referred to again. When I rang up our Commanding
Ofﬁcer next day to say that I’d had a lesbian assault she sounded
puzzled and said: ‘What’s that?’119

For other women, however, participation in the forces gave them the
opportunity to re-evaluate their sexual orientation. Sarah Allan’s military service was a ‘God-send’ as she was liberated from her restrictive
home life and a ‘stiﬂing network of boyfriends in whom she had very
little interest’. She discovered a small band of lesbian women in her ATS
unit and, empowered by this, experienced ‘her ﬁrst physical relationship
with a woman’. This, it was said, ‘helped her to recognize and label her
sexuality’.120
Although lesbianism, unlike male homosexuality, was not an
offence under English law, the military authorities were concerned
about its impact on discipline in the women’s services and the malicious
gossip and scandal that might arise.121 In 1941, the chief woman medical adviser to the ATS, Dr Letitia Fairﬁeld, drew up a memorandum on
same-sex relationships, entitled ‘A Special Problem’, which, although
never generally issued to ATS ofﬁcers, was available to those who
needed guidance on this matter. In the memorandum, Fairﬁeld drew
a distinction between an ‘emotional crush’ and a ‘sexual attraction akin
to falling in love’, and contended that ‘consciously homosexual friendships between women are usually kept entirely or almost entirely on
a mental plane’ while ‘perverted physical practices (i.e. unnatural variations of the physical intimacies which would be natural between persons
of opposite sexes) are fortunately rare’: ‘Where this occurs it is either
among women of a depraved type or among the self-conscious intelligentsia, who are probably more actuated by craving for excitement than
by real desire.’ Her advice to female ofﬁcers in cases of suspected
lesbianism was ‘to act only on deﬁnitive evidence’ as ‘allegations of
homosexuality are highly libellous’; to explore the ‘innocent explanation for incidents before accepting a sinister one’, such as women sleeping together in beds ‘for warmth’ or because they had slept with their
sisters ‘all their lives and think it is a natural thing to do’; to bear in mind
that lesbian behaviour was ‘not necessarily associated with masculine
physique or with the adoption of male clothing or pursuits’; and that
any action taken ‘should vary with circumstances’. Fairﬁeld argued that
‘homosexuality is essentially the persistence of an immature mental and
emotional phase. This gives hope that the foolish adolescent, or even the
middle-aged woman who had slipped into childish sentimentality, will
grow out of an unhealthy craze.’ But as practical measures she recommended that

couples sharing an excessive attachment should be separated by
reposting one of them if they cannot be diverted by other
interests . . . For the fortunately rare cases of perverted practice
or attempted corruption of other women by talk or example,
discharge from the service would be the only course.122
In 1941, Jane Trefusis Forbes also offered some guidelines for dealing
with members of the WAAF who displayed ‘lesbian tendencies’.
Describing them as ‘misﬁts’, she recommended that a woman suspected
of lesbianism should be told that her ‘behaviour is that of a schoolgirl
and that these sentimental attachments are not what we expect from
airwomen who must necessarily always set a good example to others.’
‘Unless she does pull herself together after a talk or two’, she continued,
‘it is obvious that we would have to dispense with her services.’123
The association between lesbianism and the ‘foolish adolescent’
was, as Emma Vickers has indicated, consistent with prevailing notions
of the ‘schoolgirl crush’ and ‘boarding school desire’ that featured in the
sexological typologies of the period.124 Moreover, as she points out,
‘queerness had yet to make the full transition from an act to an
identity’.125 Nonetheless, the women’s forces seem to have adopted
a pragmatic response to the presence of lesbian women given the overriding need to retain trained personnel.126 Dr Albertine Winner, who
served as a woman doctor with the Royal Army Medical Corps,
reported that in the ATS most cases of lesbianism were ‘dealt with by
judicious posting’ and ‘only some half-dozen women had to be discharged on these grounds out of nearly a quarter of a million who
passed through our hands’. She described this as ‘a very remarkable
record’.127 It was also possible for lesbian women quietly to pre-empt
the military authorities. WAAF conscript, Pat James, missed her civilian
female lover in London and ‘happened to hear that people were getting
out of the WAAFs by being lesbians. So I thought that I would.’ She thus
arranged an appointment with a service psychiatrist: ‘He just asked
about how I felt when I saw a woman, about my reaction. I told him,
and I was out very quickly.’128

9 OVERSEAS SERVICE
Deployment
During the course of the war, members of the three women’s
services were deployed with their male ‘parent’ forces all around the
world. In the spring of 1940, a party from the ATS arrived in France to
serve with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and as the conﬂict
progressed servicewomen were posted to such places as the United
States, Canada, the West Indies, Egypt, Palestine, Algeria, Kenya,
South Africa, Italy, Gibraltar, Malta, Australia, India, Ceylon and
north-west Europe.1 By the end of the conﬂict, approximately 31,000
female personnel were based overseas. These included some 18,000
from the ATS, 7,000 from the WAAF and 6,000 from the WRNS.2
The decision to employ the women’s forces abroad was not
taken lightly by the military authorities. For example, while the Air
Ministry gave its consent to a contingent of WAAF code and cypher
ofﬁcers being sent to the Middle East in the summer of 1941,3 it was
unwilling to send other airwomen to this theatre. The Air Member for
Personnel, Air Marshal Philip Babington, judged that it would be problematic to provide suitable accommodation for a large number of
Waafs in the region and that it was not safe for women to venture out
at night in some areas. In addition, it would be difﬁcult to bring them
home if they fell pregnant and the presence of female personnel would
complicate matters if the armed forces had to be evacuated in a military
emergency.4 It was not until early in 1944 that the RAF authorities

1::79

.

3 /

175 / Deployment
consented to a more general posting of airwomen to the Middle East.
This was largely due to the pressing demands on RAF manpower, as
well as the improved military position in the theatre, but it was also
hoped that it would enhance the prestige of, and pride in, the WAAF.5 It
was apparent, moreover, that the arrival of Waafs at foreign bases
invariably boosted the spirits of their male colleagues stationed there.
Constance Woodhead wrote that ‘due attention was given to the
repeated plea that the presence of ofﬁcers and airwomen would raise
the morale of the RAF in certain places’.6
Meanwhile, various safeguards were built into the deployment
of servicewomen overseas. There were provisos regarding age. In the
ATS, the minimum age for volunteers to serve abroad was set at twenty
and in the WAAF twenty-one. In the WRNS, women over twenty-one
were eligible to volunteer, with parental consent needed for those under
that age.7 There were limitations on the duration of tours of duty: in the
ATS, the period was ﬁxed at three years, whilst in the WRNS it was
between two and two-and-a-half years and in the WAAF it was two
years.8 And there were restrictions on certain types of work. In the
Middle East, for instance, airwomen were not permitted to serve as
drivers ‘owing to the risk of a breakdown in native areas, where
a woman might be at a disadvantage’.9
There were also more general stipulations drawn up regarding
the utilisation of female personnel in overseas theatres of war. During
the so-called ‘great ﬂap’ in the summer of 1942, when Rommel’s
Panzerarmee Afrika advanced deep into Egypt, the Mediterranean
ﬂeet, along with its WRNS units, was temporarily evacuated from
Alexandria and Wrens based at the port were hurriedly packed into
railway cattle trucks and transported overnight to Ismailia.10 In the
wake of these events, the Admiralty laid down some ground rules for
the deployment of the WRNS abroad. These speciﬁed that Wrens
should not normally be deployed in ‘forward areas’ where they could
fall into the hands of the enemy, but that ‘the efﬁciency of the Service
must be the ﬁrst consideration’ and in the event of an emergency those
engaged in ‘important operational duties’, such as cyphering, would be
expected to remain at their posts with their male colleagues.11
The War Ofﬁce developed its own guidelines. In the summer of
1943, with preparations for the invasion of France underway, discussions began among the army authorities on the employment of the ATS
on the continent of Europe. General Sir Bernard Paget, the new

Commander-in-Chief of 21st Army Group – the Anglo-Canadian formation earmarked for the landings in France which included auxiliaries
among its headquarters’ staff – suggested that a clear policy needed to be
drawn up on this issue and proposed that members of the ATS should be
utilised at rear headquarters, base installations and along the lines of
communication. He contended that they had ‘by their discipline, efﬁciency and esprit-de-corps’ earned the right to serve with the army in this
theatre; that they would ‘free more men for the forward areas’; and that
while they would not be deliberately exposed to the dangers of enemy
action, there was ‘no reason why they should not take the same risks
overseas as they do under war conditions at home’. It was also reported
from North Africa that the presence of Queen Alexandra’s Imperial

1::79

177 / Deployment
Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) near the front line had had ‘a most
beneﬁcial effect on the morale of the troops’.12 The ATS hierarchy
endorsed this deployment on the continent. Senior female ofﬁcers cautioned that auxiliaries should not proceed abroad too early in
a campaign, in case they proved to be ‘a liability rather than an asset’
and that in contrast to the presence of the QAIMNS in forward areas,
which conveyed ‘a sense of security’ to troops, the employment of the
ATS close to the front ‘might give rise to a sense of obligation and
responsibility on the part of commanders and soldiers’. Nevertheless,
the view was held that members of their force should serve in any theatre
of war required by the army other than those involving Japan.13
There was, however, some wavering on the part of War Ofﬁce
ofﬁcials about the deployment of the ATS in Europe.14 Concerns were
raised about the political risks of sending auxiliaries into an active
theatre of war, where there was the danger of a military reverse. There
were also doubts about whether adequate accommodation and other
facilities could be provided for women in devastated areas. In such
adverse circumstances, it was cautioned that they ‘might well be an
encumbrance’.15 Yet with a decision about the despatch of female
personnel to Italy pending, in late 1943 Sir James Grigg agreed to a set
of principles for the employment of the ATS overseas. These speciﬁed
that no auxiliaries were to enter theatres of war where there was the
‘slightest prospect’ of invasion by the Japanese, but that in other theatres
discretion was to be left to British commanders-in-chief. They were to
make their judgements on the bases that women should only be
employed when ‘the military situation is so stabilised as to give
a reasonable assurance that our hold on the territory is secure’ and
when ‘our penetration of the territory is sufﬁciently deep geographically
to ensure adequate living conditions and amenities for British women
employed in the back areas’.16
These War Ofﬁce criteria were rather more protective of servicewomen than those drawn up by the Admiralty, in that they made no
mention of ‘the efﬁciency of the service’ as being the ﬁrst priority in
a deployment and drew no distinction between those engaged in ‘important operational duties’ and others.17 In view of this, and given the
desirability of uniform inter-service practices in this matter, the naval
authorities were reluctantly obliged to come into line with those of their
army counterparts. The Air Ministry also adopted these general
principles.18 There were, however, members of the ATS who bridled

1::79

at the restraints put on their employment abroad, since there were
occasions when they were prohibited from working in areas in which
civilian women from such organisations as the British Red Cross Society
and the Council of Voluntary War Work were operating. One post-war
report recorded that this anomaly was ‘strongly resented by the ATS and
justiﬁably so’.19
The despatch of sizeable numbers of servicewomen overseas
brought to the fore the question of trooping arrangements for the women’s
services. As the war went on there had been complaints from parents, and
from servicewomen themselves, about the conditions on troopships and in
early 1944 representatives from the three women’s forces met with the
relevant military and civilian authorities to ‘thrash out the difﬁculties’.
‘Thrash is the correct word,’ recounted Leslie Whateley, ‘for I had the
feeling the whole time that the Chairman of the Committee (a majorgeneral) wished all my sex at the bottom of the sea, rather than on it in
ships.’20 Despite this animus, it was agreed that a special scale of troopship
accommodation should be provided for female personnel. This included
the provisos that no more than 250 servicewomen would normally be
embarked on any ship; that 20 square feet of sleeping space was to be
allocated to each woman on troop decks during journeys west of Suez,
with cabins provided for them east of Suez whenever possible; that
a minimum of eight lavatories per hundred women were to be provided
adjacent to their quarters; and that when necessary a twenty-four-hour
guard was to be mounted on the women’s accommodation to ensure their
privacy.21
Some servicewomen were transported to foreign postings in
Royal Navy warships. In the summer of 1941, an entire WRNS
party of twelve cypher ofﬁcers and ten wireless telegraphists perished en route to Gibraltar when their small, slow-moving merchant
ship, SS Aguila, was sunk by a German U-boat 500 miles west of
Land’s End.22 This loss came as a great shock to the WRNS. Vera
Laughton Mathews regarded it as ‘one of the worst blows our
Service suffered’ and a salutary lesson for those who might have
imagined that servicewomen would somehow remain inviolate to the
tragedies of war:
I think their death brought home to many for the ﬁrst time the
realization that these young women were not joining up to wear
a smart uniform or to have a good time, that they accepted

willingly a share in the hardship, the responsibility and the perils
of Service life.23
As a consequence, it was agreed that Wrens would henceforth be permitted to travel in ﬁghting ships whilst proceeding overseas.24 Yet this
was not always popular with the sailors. Mary Pratt, sailing from Kenya
to Ceylon on HMS Chitral in late 1943, recalled that their presence
caused ‘widespread dissent’:
Two days out from Mombasa, a German U-Boat was sighted in
the distance – normally a fast destroyer would give chase and
engage the enemy, but, because of females on board, we turned
tail for harbour again, to await a safe passage – our names were
mud, though most of us would have relished a good scrap at
sea!25
Where practical, efforts were made to recruit locally for the women’s
forces. Early in 1942, for example, an ATS training depot was established at Sarafand in Palestine and, after appropriate screening to ensure
that the Axis powers or extremist groups did not inﬁltrate the British
forces, local women were enlisted for service in the Middle East (with
some also later serving in Italy and Austria). The vast majority of the
recruits were Jewish volunteers from Mandatory Palestine – including
recent refugees from Europe who had strong personal reasons to help
defeat the Nazis – but there were also contingents of Greeks, Czechs and
Cypriots, as well as some Arab women.26 The creation of this
Palestinian branch of the ATS was not without its difﬁculties for the
British female commanders on the spot. Not only were a number of the
recruits unable to speak English so ATS ofﬁcers had to work through
interpreters,27 but also some of them were deemed difﬁcult to handle:
‘The UK contingent soon learned to be surprised at nothing . . . ’,
commented Tryce Taylor. ‘A newly arrived English Sgt. Major was
surprised that no one took any notice when a Private hit her smartly
on the head with a ﬁle tray. Pte N. was just in one of her “moods”.’28
Furthermore, there were political tensions arising from the fact that
such bodies as the Jewish Council of Women’s Organisations in
Palestine seemed intent on trying to ensure that the service became
a vehicle for the Zionist ambitions of the Yishuv. Indeed, much to the
infuriation of the local ATS chief, recruiting posters appeared embellished with the Star of David, which suggested that the enterprise was to

be exclusively Jewish.29 Nonetheless, the ATS authorities seemed to
have welded this disparate group into a credible force.30 At their peak,
some 5,000 ATS personnel were based in the Middle East, of whom
4,000 had been raised locally.31 After the war Jewish women from
Palestine who had served in the ATS helped to establish the women’s
corps of the Israel Defence Forces but, as Anat Granit-Hacohen has
observed, their wartime service with the British forces sat uncomfortably alongside the active resistance of the Yishuv to the British mandatory regime in the Zionist narrative.32
Elsewhere the enlistment of local women led to bureaucratic
wrangling in Whitehall. In 1942 there were demands for additional ATS
personnel to serve in Washington DC, but with growing pressures on
the force in the UK it was difﬁcult to spare more auxiliaries for the USA.
In response, it was decided to recruit women from the West Indies for
service with the Washington-based ATS.33 This initiative, as Ben
Bousquet and Colin Douglas have demonstrated, resulted in an interdepartmental dispute over the racial make-up of the recruits. The position of the War Ofﬁce, some of whose ofﬁcials displayed a barely
disguised racism towards those not of ‘pure European descent’, was
that only white Caribbean women should be appointed to jobs in
Washington.34 Any other course of action, it was claimed, ‘might well
cause embarrassment to the American authorities’.35 The view of the
Colonial Ofﬁce, however, was that to operate such a colour bar would
create resentment among black West Indians and, mindful of the political unrest in the Caribbean in the 1930s, threaten imperial stability.36
In the end, the War Ofﬁce got its way and 200 white West Indian women
served with the ATS in the USA. But the Colonial Ofﬁce insisted that
black West Indian women should be deployed with the ATS in the UK.37
As a result, despite the best efforts of the War Ofﬁce to prevent such
a step – ‘I don’t at all like your West Indian ATS ideas’, sniped Sir James
Grigg to his opposite number at the Colonial Ofﬁce, Oliver Stanley,
when he was pressed on the matter in the spring of 194338 – a raciallymixed group of 100 women came to serve in Britain. In the meantime,
a further 300 West Indian women were employed with the ATS in the
Caribbean itself.39 These auxiliaries were said to have been eager to aid
the ‘mother country’. ‘We felt that we were British’, remembered Ena
Collymore-Woodstock. ‘I was deﬁantly British, I felt that way.’40 But
they inevitably encountered racial prejudice. In the Caribbean, ATS
ofﬁcers stationed there were alleged to have blocked the award of

a British Empire Medal to Connie Mark, a black Jamaican auxiliary
employed to undertake secretarial duties, because she refused to clean
their houses for them like a colonial servant.41 Peter Fryer cites the
following examples of racism in the UK:
A West Indian girl in the ATS was refused a new issue of shoes
by her ofﬁcer, who added: ‘At home you don’t wear shoes
anyway.’ An Army Ofﬁcer to a West Indian ATS: ‘If I can’t get
white women I’ll something well do without.’42
A related issue was a desire on the part of the military authorities to
protect the racial superiority of British servicewomen in overseas stations. In India, for instance, Constance Woodhead recorded that the
administration of WAAF personnel was complicated by the requirement
that ‘the prestige of white women had to be safeguarded’. Airwomen in
Bombay were reported to have been unwilling to travel to their work in
the same lorries as ‘natives of the sweeper class’ and alternative transport arrangements had to be made for them. This was, she remarked, ‘a
natural and correct objection but tiresome for authority’. Woodhead
further observed that the interactions between the Waafs and the locally
recruited Indian women whom they worked alongside were

‘harmonious but quaint. The airwomen regarded the others with
a tolerant good-humour that did not admit of equality.’43

Compulsion
In the early years of the war, the overseas service of members
of the women’s forces was conducted on a voluntary basis. The
Admiralty, however, found it increasingly difﬁcult to meet the growing demand for Wrens abroad from volunteers alone. In 1943 it thus
placed a liability for compulsory service overseas on ‘mobile’ WRNS
ofﬁcers and ratings over the age of twenty-one, except in cases
where this would cause ‘undue hardship’. Those already enrolled
at the time of this new liability were permitted to claim exemption
from the obligation and some 11,500 female personnel did so.44 The
Air Ministry chose not to follow this path. There was some concern
as to whether overseas commitments could continue to be fulﬁlled
by volunteer airwomen and, as a result, the age at which they could
volunteer to work abroad was lowered to twenty if older Waafs
were not forthcoming. Nevertheless, it was calculated that requirements could be met without compulsion.45
The War Ofﬁce was also faced with the prospect of compelling
members of the ATS to serve overseas if required. In order to increase
the number of auxiliaries eligible for posting abroad, in the spring of
1944 the army authorities lowered the minimum age at which they
could volunteer for such service to nineteen.46 There continued, however, to be a worrying shortfall of volunteers. This was largely put down
to parental disapproval. ‘There are many girls who would like to volunteer,’ recorded General Adam, ‘but who have pressure put on them by
their parents not to do so.’47 As a result, and given the political sensitivities involved, in the late autumn Sir James Grigg approached the War
Cabinet for permission to institute the compulsory drafting of the ATS
overseas. It was estimated that there would soon be a net deﬁciency of
3,500 auxiliaries for commitments abroad if there continued to be
a reliance on volunteering.48 ‘The demands for ATS from overseas
commands’, argued Grigg, ‘now far exceed the number of volunteers
and, in this respect, the position is likely to become progressively worse.’
It was also pointed out that under the present arrangements the periods
of foreign duty for auxiliaries would inevitably get longer: ‘it will
become increasingly difﬁcult to restrict the overseas tour for ATS to

1::79

183 / Compulsion
the present maximum of three years if we are unable to provide the
necessary replacements from home’.49
The War Cabinet was hesitant. Ernest Bevin, for example, was
concerned about the wisdom of applying compulsion at a time when
munitions workers were beginning to be released from government
service and wondered if all possible avenues to increase the number of
volunteers had been explored. It was also questioned why the WAAF
had apparently managed to secure the necessary volunteers when the
ATS had not.50 Grigg continued to press the War Ofﬁce’s case. It was
contended that all reasonable steps had been taken to stimulate volunteering within the ATS, including tours of home commands by senior
female ofﬁcers to elicit suitable candidates, and that the WAAF was not
faced with the same difﬁculties in obtaining sufﬁcient numbers of
volunteers as the ATS. The former, it was explained, incorporated
a higher proportion of Waafs to airmen than that existing between
auxiliaries and soldiers, and whilst the RAF deployed less than half its
personnel overseas, the army had to utilise two-thirds of its strength
abroad. Furthermore, it was re-iterated that not only was there an
urgent need to send auxiliaries overseas to make up for shortfalls in
male personnel, especially signallers and clerks, but it was also stressed
that their presence would hearten the troops in foreign parts, particularly in occupied Germany where a policy of non-fraternisation would
be put in place.51 ‘Another very important reason why it is desirable to
have as many British women overseas’, Grigg thus stated, ‘is the effect
this will have in maintaining the morale of the soldier.’52
The War Cabinet revisited the issue and, subject to various
safeguards, agreed to the War Ofﬁce’s request.53 In the meantime, the
Prime Minister sounded out his daughter, Mary, on the subject. She had
asked the auxiliaries in her mixed anti-aircraft battery about whether
they wished to proceed overseas. ‘The almost universal reply’, noted
Churchill, ‘was “Not half”!’54 At the end of 1944, it was announced by
Grigg in the House of Commons that while volunteers for foreign
service would continue to be sought, and given priority in assembling
drafts, members of the ATS would become liable for compulsory posting abroad. Yet this obligation would only apply to auxiliaries who
were over the age of twenty-one (the equivalent age for soldiers at this
time was eighteen-and-a-half), unmarried and deemed medically ﬁt for
such a posting. Additionally, it was stipulated that auxiliaries sent overseas to serve with mixed batteries would be strictly conﬁned to

volunteers, that female personnel would not be deployed in India except
as volunteers and that they would not be despatched to Burma or West
Africa either compulsorily or as volunteers.55
Before this policy could be activated, MPs insisted that the
matter should be debated in the House, much to the frustration of
Leslie Whateley, who believed that ‘the whole object of the Service
would be defeated if a political faction dictated how and where we
could post auxiliaries’.56 During the debate in early 1945, a number of
members voiced their anxieties. Spearheaded by the Labour MP for East
Edinburgh, Frederick Pethick-Lawrence – who, it was pointed out with
a certain irony, as a former leading light of the Women’s Social and
Political Union was ‘the man who went to gaol to get women votes’ but
was now ‘against sending our daughters abroad’57 – various concerns
were expressed. These included the military necessity of drafting auxiliaries overseas, the home ties of those sent abroad, the conditions for
women in theatres of war, the dangers to them of enemy action and the
threats to their morals from the ‘licentious soldier’.58 ‘Certain restraints
which prevail at home under normal conditions’, warned PethickLawrence, ‘are somewhat relaxed when we get into foreign
countries.’59 Grigg and the supporters of the proposals, however, won
the day. It was emphasised that whilst every effort had been made to
comb out soldiers for frontline duties, the number of ATS volunteers for
service overseas was still far below what was required in order to help
maintain the ﬁghting troops. It was also pointed out that members of the
WRNS were already liable for compulsory posting abroad, a decision
that no one had questioned. Furthermore, reassurances were given that
the family responsibilities of auxiliaries would be taken into consideration when posting overseas and drafts would not be sent until senior
ATS ofﬁcers were satisﬁed that adequate amenities were in place. It was
afﬁrmed, moreover, that auxiliaries would be mainly conﬁned to rear
areas and, given the recent V-weapon attacks, would probably be safer
abroad than in the south of England.60 As for the moral perils, these
were considered to be overplayed. ‘Women’s standards of morals are
not determined by geographical boundaries’, asserted Edith
Summerskill. ‘The weak and irresponsible girl will get into trouble in
London, Bristol, Manchester or Wigan. If she is going to get into
trouble, she will not wait until she gets to the other side of the
Channel.’61 In April 1945, as the war in Europe was drawing to
a close, the new scheme was promulgated in an Army Council

1::79

Instruction, with the added provisos that members of the ATS would
not be compulsorily posted overseas if there were sufﬁcient volunteers in
an auxiliary’s trade, if they were the only child of one remaining parent,
or if there were compassionate reasons for keeping them close to home.
The opportunity was also taken to reduce the ATS tour of duty overseas
to two years, with postings to India and Ceylon (which was to be treated
as a single theatre), as well as to Washington DC, cut to eighteen
months.62
In order to reassure her auxiliaries, Whateley wrote to them
to explain the need for compulsion. In her letter not only did she
attempt to counter those who might claim there were still young, ﬁt
men at home who could be employed with the army abroad by
stressing that ‘all is not gold that glitters’ and ‘you cannot use
a weakling as a Battle-school instructor’, but she also argued that
even if additional manpower could be found, it would be wrong to
prolong the war to train it when a body of trained women was
already available to answer the calls of Field Marshals
Montgomery and Alexander.63 She further appealed to the benevolence of the future wives and mothers in the ATS:
Many of you will marry and bring children into the world, and
we are not going to have it laid at our door that for want of
a little more unselﬁshness on our part now our children or our
husbands might have to go through the horrors of another war,
which with modern science will be far worse than even this one.
Selﬁshness has brought us into this war and only unselﬁshness
on the part of us all can bring a lasting peace.64
This was not the end of the matter. As Jane Rosenzweig has shown,
following notiﬁcation of the War Ofﬁce’s intentions in regard to the
issue of compulsory postings overseas, many letters of complaint from
agitated parents, worried about the prospect of their daughters being
dispatched abroad, arrived in Whitehall.65 One indignant father
claimed that ‘rumour has it these girls are about to be sent overseas to
satisfy the sexual impulses of our men and to make it unnecessary for
them to fraternise with foreign women’.66 To put ofﬁcial minds at rest,
in May 1945, Violet Markham and Mary Stocks (who had served
together on the 1942 Markham committee) undertook a fact-ﬁnding
visit to ATS units in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany on behalf
of the army authorities. They reported ‘bitter complaints’ from

1::79

auxiliaries about the innuendos circulating in the popular press at home
‘on the comforts to the troops theme’ and concluded that
We could ﬁnd, during our visit, no grounds for stories detrimental to the character and morale of the ATS . . . .
From all we saw and heard we feel that we could reassure the
most anxious of parents as to the general surroundings in which
their daughters are working and the measures taken to ensure
their welfare.67
General Adam was understandably cheered by these ﬁndings: ‘I need
hardly tell you’, he informed Markham, ‘that the general tone of your
report . . . makes very reassuring reading to me. Indeed, I always felt that
this was the story you would bring back from any visit to the ATS
overseas.’68
Meanwhile, the ATS hierarchy did what it could to monitor the
well-being of its auxiliaries abroad. On a tour of inspection of Italy in
the summer of 1945, Whateley discovered that the ATS signallers in Bari
had been housed by the army in a ‘third-rate’ hotel sandwiched between
a brothel and a prophylactic station: ‘I was extremely angry with those
who had selected such a billet for these women . . . [and] made up my
mind that they must be moved.’69 She also took the opportunity to
request more ironing facilities for members of her force in Italy as they
‘felt acutely about the fact that . . . they had to appear in crumpled drill
skirts, while the American Servicewomen, beside whom they worked
and lived, had all the means available to be perfectly turned out’.70

Members of the women’s forces performed a wide variety of
occupational roles overseas. These included such employments as
cooks, clerks, switchboard operators, storewomen, nursing orderlies,
convoy drivers, radar operators, electricians, air mechanics and
meteorologists.71 In addition, WRNS code and cypher personnel were
deployed aboard large troopship passenger liners (known as ‘monsters’)
to handle the signals trafﬁc and were part of the communications staff
that accompanied Churchill to the wartime allied conferences in
Washington, Casablanca, Quebec, Tehran and Yalta.72 Joan Schwarz
was one of the Prime Minister’s personal WRNS cypher ofﬁcers at Yalta
in early 1945 and recalled that such was the delight of the British naval

delegation from Moscow at meeting a contingent from her service at the
conference, that a belated New Year’s Eve party ‘ended up with them
drinking champagne out of WRNS shoes’.73
Working conditions abroad could be challenging. WAAF teleprinter operator, Rebecca Barnett, found herself performing her duties
in a sweltering RAF palm hut in Ceylon.74 ATS clerk, Daphne Smith,
plied her trade in a sodden, shrapnel-holed army tent in Normandy.75
WRNS wireless telegraphist, Joan Dinwoodie, toiled away in a batinfested naval watch-room in Kenya.76 An assignment to the RAF’s
Telecommunications Centre Middle East (TME) was a particularly
onerous posting. Built underground in the desert near Heliopolis on
the outskirts of Cairo to house the signals and cypher sections of the
main RAF headquarters, the constant noise of the communications
machinery, combined with the stiﬂing heat, pervasive dust and lack of
fresh air, invariably left the airwomen physically and mentally
drained.77 For one WAAF code and cypher ofﬁcer, Ailsa Donald, who
suffered from bronchial asthma, this environment (nicknamed ‘the
hole’) was especially difﬁcult to function in: ‘even now the initials
TME make my blood run cold . . . It was hell’.78
Despite the best intentions of the military authorities, there were
occasions when servicewomen were sucked into combat zones. During
the campaign in France in 1940, members of the ATS got caught up in the
chaos of the BEF’s retreat. Ambulance driver Doreen Atkinson vividly
remembered running for cover from Luftwaffe dive-bombers, when her
convoy of vehicles was held up by a battery of Royal Artillery guns:
The front plane seemed to waggle its wings, and then it banked
over and came screaming straight down towards me . . . I buried
my chin and nose as far into the soft earth as I could and lay
petriﬁed. It was awful; a succession of sharp explosions, ﬂashes,
cries, showers of clods, sods, stones and powdered earth landing
all round. And in the midst of all that came the scream of the
next dive-bomber, more earth-shuddering bangs, cries and
showers of debris, and then the next, and the next, and the
next. And then it was over. Silence, except for the far-away
drone of the departing Stukas.
Three gunner stretcher-bearers carried their bloody, motionless loads into the ﬁrst two ambulances, and then we edged our
way past the guns, glad to be clear of such a target.79

The ATS contingents were successfully evacuated across the Channel,
but some of them got away very late in the day. A party of bilingual ATS
telephonists working at an exchange in Paris was among the last Allied
troops to escape from the capital before the Germans arrived. They were
said to have driven out of the capital with their male Royal Signals
colleagues as the enemy entered the city from the other side. The women
eventually arrived in Britain on 16 June, having embarked on an old
Channel steamer at Saint-Malo.80
In the Middle East, female personnel were drawn into forward
areas. At the time of the ‘great ﬂap’ in 1942, 502 Motor Ambulance
Company, ATS, was based in Alexandria, sixty miles from the front
line, but sometimes its duties took it closer to the ﬁghting. Pat Hall,
a sergeant in the unit, recounted that this could be an exhilarating, if
somewhat unnerving, experience for the female drivers:
An occasional highly coveted job took an ambulance westwards
on the desert road where a daunting sign glared at a new-comer
‘Are you prepared for an ambush?’ Jane [one of 502’s drivers]
was the ﬁrst to encounter this and wondered momentarily if she
should stop and apply some powder and lipstick. There seemed
otherwise little preparation she could make.81
Elsewhere in the theatre, the proximity of the enemy led to steps being
taken to enable servicewomen to defend themselves. Elizabeth Watkins
was a WAAF code and cypher ofﬁcer based at the Hotel Metropole in
Cairo, decrypting vital military messages from the battlefronts, and with
the Germans threatening to break through to the city she was taught
how to handle a gun at close quarters in case her unit was overrun:
Of course women were not meant to carry ﬁre arms, but that
very week we had been taken to the roof of the hotel and shown
how to use them. Anyone who had one (mine had been liberated
from an Italian) was permitted to carry it. Tactfully, it had been
made plain that it was preferable for women cypher ofﬁcers not
to be taken prisoners, and we were shown how to shoot ourselves should it become necessary.82
In Italy, members of the women’s services could be found close to the
front. ATS clerk, Angela Cummins, was assigned to Allied intelligence
and in the immediate aftermath of the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944
she and her colleagues picked over the battleﬁeld for enemy documents:

1::79

As we were climbing to the top, all the way we saw Polish
soldiers, clearing up after the battle, collecting bodies. I saw
a bayonet sticking out from behind a rock and decided to have it
for a souvenir. I went over and gave it a tug, and out rolled
a German body. I was shocked, I can tell you! I didn’t take the
bayonet, after all, as you can imagine.83
One intrepid ATS ofﬁcer, Junior Commander Goggin, even apprehended a senior enemy commander in Italy. This servicewoman was
appointed to run a civil affairs unit, whose task it was to administer
newly-liberated territories until civil government was restored, and in
1945 the team was assigned to the province of Cremona. Although the
area had still to be cleared of Germans and there continued to be
sporadic ﬁghting between them and the Italian resistance, Goggin persuaded the US army to ferry her unarmed party across the River Po to
the city of Cremona where, in tandem with a female refugee Hungarian
doctor, she set to work on reorganising the systems of public health,
welfare and education amidst periodic shooting. Three days later, the
German ofﬁcer in charge of the garrison emerged from his hiding place
and personally surrendered to Goggin rather than face the wrath of the
partisans.84
In north-west Europe, ATS ‘gunners’ were utilised in the
anti-aircraft ﬁring line during the winter of 1944–5 to help combat
the V-weapons directed against newly-liberated Belgium.85 Joan
Cowey and forty female comrades were despatched to a gun site
defending the key port of Antwerp and, on arrival in Belgium, they
were met by trucks to take them to the anti-aircraft camp. The army
drivers expressed their anxiety about female personnel being
deployed to such a target area: ‘Antwerp was really getting it bad.
They said they didn’t know who was responsible for sending us, but
they felt bad about women being sent into it.’86 As feared, the day
after they arrived the camp received a direct hit from a V-2 and
a number of the ATS contingent were wounded while they unpacked
in their Nissen huts. ‘We just sort of crawled out and nothing much
was said’, recollected Cowey. ‘We wanted to be tough so we
wouldn’t let the men down.’87 Despite such setbacks, mixed antiaircraft batteries in Belgium were said to have destroyed nineteen
V-weapons.88 ‘We had certainly travelled a long way from the days
when it had been doubtful whether women were capable of taking

an operational role’, observed Major-General Sir Frederick Pile of
these units.89
The presence of female personnel in the vicinity of the battleﬁeld
could, however, leave servicemen in rear areas feeling emasculated. Pat
Hall’s husband was an ofﬁcer in the Royal Artillery based in Beirut –
where ‘only one shot had been ﬁred in anger, at an unidentiﬁed felucca’90
– and when she visited him while on leave after months of pressurised
work near the front in Egypt, a tension was apparent between them:
there was no denying that the reversal of the normal wartime
marital roles created a bit of a strain, especially on John. Instead
of the warrior returning from the wars to lay his spoils at his
lady’s feet, it was the lady returning from an active service
zone – luckily without spoils – to bring up-to-the-minute news
from the front to his brother ofﬁcers.91
A perception of male disempowerment could also be found among
servicemen working alongside their female colleagues overseas. Joan
Cowey discerned that some of the male gunners on her Belgian gun site
were uncomfortable about the arrival of the ATS:
I think at this point a lot of the men felt badly about having women
stationed with them. You can understand that. There were some
veterans of Middle East campaigns, of big battles, and it must have
been a real comedown for them to be serving with women. They
never said anything, though. It’s just what I thought.92
This male unease was corroborated by WAAF wireless operator Mary
Winter. She was assigned to work with the mobile signals unit of the 2nd
Tactical Air Force in Belgium, which had been in theatre since shortly
after D-Day, and it was apparent that the integration of airwomen into
this male-dominated detachment was tantamount to ‘stealing all their
thunder’: ‘One even said he was writing home to tell his wife what
danger he was in . . . and how she wouldn’t believe him if there were
WOMEN out here!’93
Off duty, servicewomen overseas were able to sample the
delights of parts of the world that few would have had the opportunity
to visit in civilian life. During her deployment in South Asia, Prim Taylor
of the WRNS was lavishly entertained on the estates of tea planters in
Ceylon, learnt to surf in the Indian Ocean and visited the Taj Mahal in
Agra.94 In the Middle East, Eileen Shaw of the WAAF rode a camel

around the pyramids at Giza, devoured ice cream at Groppi’s cafe in
Cairo and sang with a choir in the Bethlehem grotto during midnight
mass (despite the organ breaking down).95 In North America, Elizabeth
Dunkley of the WRNS explored an old whaling station at Siasconset on
Nantucket Island off Cape Cod, went black duck shooting on the
St. Lawrence River in Quebec and participated in a squaw dance around
a bonﬁre on a Navajo Indian reservation in Arizona: ‘One Christmas in
Tennessee I tried to learn poker but too much Bourbon whisky defeated
me!’96 There was also room for more illicit escapades. Elizabeth
Watkins was regularly smuggled aboard test ﬂights by a friendly RAF
pilot at the Heliopolis maintenance unit when he put a bomber through
its paces. These ﬂights involved Watkins borrowing a parachute from
one of the airmen and hitching up her skirt in order to pass the straps of
the harness between her legs:
Once I saw everyone smirking as I went out to the plane and
wondered what was wrong; was I showing too much leg? Only
when I took the parachute off did I see the owner’s name,
‘Virgin’, stamped right across it.97
British female personnel tended to be much in demand as off-duty
companions for servicemen abroad. In Ceylon, the social whirl
around Colombo was, according to Wren Dorothy Smith, ‘incredibly heady stuff for girls of our age . . . As there were literally about
1,000 men to one girl, and many of the lads had not seen a white
girl for months or years, you can imagine how spoilt we were. We
loved it!’98 The same was true in Egypt. Jean Wright described the
excitement generated by the arrival of her party of Waafs at Ismailia
on the Suez Canal: ‘The men, as you can imagine, were absolutely
delighted to see so many English girls in their midst. Overwhelmed
by all the ﬂattery we were able to pick and choose our escorts.’99
Wren Penny Martin experienced a similar level of male attention in
Alexandria and Cairo:
To be young and reasonably attractive in Egypt at that time
meant, honestly, that one just had to put one’s foot down and
determine to stay home at least one evening out of the month
but even that was sometimes difﬁcult. It is no exaggeration or
lack of modesty to say that one had half a dozen invitations for
every one that there was time to accept.100

In Algiers, the arrival of a contingent of ATS ofﬁcers was keenly awaited
by their male colleagues but, as K. P. Mannock self-deprecatingly confessed, she and her female comrades did not quite live up to their
expectations: ‘As a group, I’d say we were very lacking in glamour
and I felt very self-conscious at being dragged off to parties, where no
doubt there was the expectation of a truck full of young lovelies.’
Nevertheless, the men seemed delighted to see them: ‘Our hosts were
too polite to show any disappointment and it was made known that just
to talk to an English woman was sufﬁcient compensation for the efforts
which they made to entertain us.’101
The heavy social demands on servicewomen overseas could be
draining. There were instances of ‘party fatigue’. Third Ofﬁcer Todd of
the WRNS was based at Kilindini in Kenya and reported that one of the
drawbacks of such a posting was ‘too much gaiety . . . there were very
few women and they were always in demand. Most of them found after
six months they had to abandon the entertainments and expeditions and
could only cope with their work.’102 There was also the risk of excessive
ﬂattery. Before departing abroad, ATS ofﬁcer Ursie Barclay and her

colleagues were warned not to have their heads turned by the barrage of
compliments they were likely to receive in foreign parts. ‘If you get asked
out to dinner by twelve young men on the same night when you get
wherever you are going,’ the women were reminded, ‘it’s not because
you are popular. It’s because you’re scarce.’103 As part of their preparations for embarkation, Betty Platts and her fellow Wrens were given
a pep talk on the dark arts of carousing in the tropics. ‘Remember,’ they
were told, ‘that men’s passions are easily roused in hot climates, and
beware of slap and tickle parties, and also a long drink called a Tom
Collins, that has a hidden kick.’104
The dearth of female companionship for servicemen overseas
could make British female personnel particularly prone to sexual harassment. ATS ofﬁcer, Lavinia Orde, described a wearisome predictability to the social functions she attended in the male ofﬁcers’ clubs and rest
villas in Naples:
All seemed to talk about what they had been doing in the war,
about their squadron leader or commanding ofﬁcer, what was
likely to happen in the war in the future . . . Once I would have
been thrilled to hear such talk but it . . . [was] beginning to
pall . . . As time went on these parties always seemed to end in
the same way as Jack or Bill or Ralph or whoever who had taken
one got lit up on the very cheap wine and made less and less
sense and got more and more amorous.105
In such circumstances, servicewomen became adroit at repelling unwelcome advances. WAAF teleprinter operator, Rebecca Barnett, was stationed at Koggala in Ceylon and a RAF sergeant there was strongly
attracted to her:
It came to a head one night, when he was in charge of a truck
that was to take a crowd of us to some occasion. The truck was
already fairly full when I arrived. Then, just as I was about to
climb into its rear, ‘Determined’ (I used to sometimes call him)
waylaid me and physically pulled me to the front beside the
driving compartment. In my embarrassment I hardly liked to
shout out my objections in front of a whole truck-load of girls,
so I spent easily ﬁve minutes dissuading my amorous Sergeant
with urgent whisperings, ‘No, no, no,’ I kept repeating. I didn’t
want to be wooed, or anything else, he tried to suggest. It must

have looked like shots from a silent movie as I stood there
rejecting him while trying to remain a lady at the same time.
In the end he released me and I crawled onto the form amidst
mufﬂed giggles and accusing ‘Ohs’ and ‘Ahs’, but, of course, the
girls understood really. We were all prone to such advances
where men are desperate for women. On reﬂection, I feel that
we were a very able lot of WAAFs to come through such a time
with so little damage to ourselves.106
On occasion, senior women ofﬁcers were forced to intervene in order to
safeguard female personnel. WRNS ofﬁcer Betty Hodges recalled that at
her headquarters at Minden in occupied Germany
Quite frequently I would have Wren ratings requesting to see me
on personal matters with regards some of the rather more
unpleasant RNVR Ofﬁcers’ conduct towards them. These men
would have made passes at them which were in no way reciprocated. Would I please help them as they were very embarrassed
‘particularly as he is an Ofﬁcer!’ That meant that I would have
to go to see the Commander of the Barracks, hoping that he
would resolve the situation.107
If servicewomen struck up relationships with local men they could face
ofﬁcial disapproval. In 1944, a Wren Waddell employed in Egypt was
reported to have been seen in ‘out of bounds’ areas of Alexandria with
‘an Egyptian, whose morals left a lot to be desired’ and it transpired that
she was pregnant with his child. Waddell was persuaded by her WRNS
superiors to return to the UK, rather than marrying the man and
‘throwing away her birthright for . . . an infatuation’. But the female
ofﬁcer dealing with her case in the Middle East could not disguise her
racial disgust at the behaviour of the Wren in question: ‘The details are
extremely sordid, and having seen the man, I feel quite nauseated, and
wonder why white women do these things.’108 In 1945, the Admiralty
issued instructions that if a Wren overseas proposed to marry ‘a
coloured person or a Maltese’ then efforts should be made to persuade
her not to take this step and, if necessary, transfer her to another station
in order to ‘reconsider the matter under different conditions’.109
A posting abroad also afforded fresh opportunities for
female personnel to indulge their femininity. In South Africa, Daisy
Baldwin of the WRNS created satin underwear made from fabric

obtained in Durban’s Indian bazaar.110 In Egypt, Jean Wright of the
WAAF sported the latest in black strap handbags available from the
leather goods shops of Alexandria.111 In France, Fanny Gore
Browne of the WRNS sampled the rich fragrances stocked by the
perfumiers on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris.112 In
Italy, K. P. Mannock and her ATS colleagues had stylish civilian
dresses made up for them in Rome to wear on evenings out in the
city. Although these ‘little numbers’ (as they were known) were
popular with their female owners and much admired by the servicemen – ‘our men friends were delighted to see us in other than
khaki’113 – their senior ATS ofﬁcer objected to this ﬂouting of the
uniform rules and ordered that civilian clothes could only be worn
whilst on leave at least ﬁfty miles away from their headquarters.
‘Nevertheless,’ snorted Mannock, ‘it took more than an order to
quell our enthusiasm for turning ourselves into women after hours
and to defy it became the game of the moment.’114 Thus, the
determined frock wearers camouﬂaged their ‘little numbers’ and
devised a system of lookouts to check that the coast was clear before
making a dash out of their quarters:
Sometimes I felt that the world had indeed gone crazy when I,
a woman of nearly ﬁfty, would cram a khaki skirt and shirt over
a civilian dress and rush downstairs to a waiting car, where the
offending uniform would be whipped off and rolled into
a bundle.115
In some places the male service establishment aided and abetted
these feminine tendencies. In Malta, for instance, the naval authorities relaxed the uniform regulations to allow WRNS personnel to
don civilian clothing in public on certain occasions whilst off duty.
‘Dances are the most elaborate affairs . . . ’, wrote one Wren ofﬁcer
on the island. ‘All the Naval ofﬁcers from VAM [Vice-Admiral
Malta] down are most insistent that one wears evening dress.’116
When, in the spring of 1944, such practices were brought to the
attention of Vera Laughton Mathews she regarded them as ‘most
undesirable’.117 It was important for the prestige of the WRNS that
members of her service should ‘take pride in their uniform and be
seen about in it’ and she argued that it acted as ‘a deﬁnite protection to young girls in many Stations overseas which are ﬁlled with
troops of various nationalities’. She maintained, moreover, that the

1::79

196 / Overseas Service
wearing of uniform was an important aid to ‘lessening class
differences’:118
there may be some awkward questions asked if it becomes
known that service in the WRNS overseas involves a heavy
expenditure on clothes, or alternatively, the working class
Wren being completely put in the shade by her more well to
do colleagues.119
Yet when Laughton Mathews tried to enforce stricter uniform protocols
overseas this was met with considerable naval opposition.120 The
Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, Admiral Sir John
Cunningham, was opposed to such measures.121 He opined that giving
Wrens opportunities to wear civilian clothes occasionally when off duty
should not be seen as diminishing the uniform but rather as a welcome
chance for them to demonstrate their womanly charms:
I am conﬁdent that all members of the WRNS serving under my
command are extremely proud of their uniform, and that they
should take a feminine delight in wearing a dress of a different
colour and material on gala occasions cannot be regarded as an
indication that they look with disfavour on their uniform,
rather does it serve to conﬁrm one’s hopes that Service life has
not robbed the women of Britain of their natural feminine
instincts.122
The Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet, Admiral Sir James
Somerville, was also resistant to any tightening of the conventions.
Not only did he contend that such a step would be very unpopular
with the Wrens in Ceylon, but also that donning uniform in public
around the island actually undermined the prestige of the WRNS:
The fact that women are wearing uniform suggests to the
natives that these white women have to work, and the fact
that they have to work suggests immediately that they are of
lower class than the white women residents who they regard as
‘Masters’’ wives or daughters, and therefore persons whom it is
necessary they should treat with respect in order to avoid the
anger of the masters.
. . . if proof were needed it could be shown by the fact that
Wrens in uniform are treated with far less respect by native

servants, rickshaw coolies, taxi drivers and shop assistants than
when they are dressed in plain clothes.123
He further asserted that there was a tendency for off-duty uniformed
Wrens in port areas to be harassed by sailors of the ‘lower deck’:
Whilst it is desirable to cultivate good relations between the
WRNS and the Lower Deck, it must be appreciated that in
a crowded port with many libertymen ashore who have not
seen a white woman for some time, it becomes a matter of
embarrassment to be continually addressed by sailors and, not
to put it too strongly, to be pestered by requests to accompany
them, or to make an appointment for some future date . . . it
must be admitted that a considerable percentage of Wren ratings, who are daughters of ofﬁcers, or of a different social status
to men of the Lower Deck, ﬁnd it most embarrassing to be
continually addressed by sailors and even more embarrassing
to disengage themselves, without causing offence, from such

1::79

well meaning attempts at making acquaintance. On the other
hand, respectable women in plain clothes are rarely addressed
by sailors thanks to the natural politeness of the lower deck.124
Eventually some compromise was arrived at whereby WRNS personnel
abroad were ofﬁcially permitted to wear civilian clothing once a week in
public whilst off duty.125 But it seems that these instructions did not
reach all overseas commands. In the spring of 1945, it was reported that
Wrens serving with the British Paciﬁc Fleet were allowed to don plain
clothes on a daily basis when off base during their leisure hours.126
On occasion, members of the WRNS conspired with their sisters
in the other women’s services to subvert the latter’s dress codes. Betty
Hodges recollected that the Wrens employed with the Allied occupation
force at Minden after the end of the war in Europe were given permission by the local naval authorities to attend parties out of uniform. This,
however, caused friction with servicewomen from the ATS and WAAF:
‘when our Wrens went to their parties in dresses, they had all the men at
their feet rather than the poor uniformed girls’. Hodges tried to persuade her female opposite numbers in the other women’s forces – ‘both
rather elderly and seemingly weighed down with responsibility’ – to
loosen the rules and allow their charges to attend these functions in
civilian garb, but they were concerned that ‘some girls would have more
dresses than others . . . [and] who knows (darkly) what a poor girl would
do to get another dress?’ To ease matters, Hodges suggested that if
party-going members of the other services were not allowed out of
their barracks in plain clothes, they could change into their frocks in
the naval quarters – ‘which, of course they did, with the greatest
delight’ – and then, before returning home, slip back into uniform
again: ‘How very childish!’, she remarked of this charade.127
Some discretion seems to have been exercised over the deployment of servicewomen in a defeated and resentful Germany. For example,
eighteen-year-old WRNS teleprinter operator Laura Mountney (who
later became Laura Ashley, the prominent dress designer and interior
decorator) was among the ﬁrst waves of Wrens to land in France after
D-Day and when she moved inland from Normandy to her new quarters
in a chateau near Paris, which had previously been occupied by German
ofﬁcers, she had gleefully torn down the many pictures of Hitler that
adorned the walls and made a triumphant bonﬁre of them. Yet when she
was due to be transferred to Germany with her naval unit after VJ day,

her father, who had been badly shell shocked in the trenches during the
First World War, objected and she was posted back to the UK instead.128
Those who did serve in Germany in the aftermath of the conﬂict displayed a mixture of emotions. There was suspicion of the civilians with
whom they came into contact. Eileen McMurdo of the ATS sensed an
‘almost palpable hatred which emanated from the majority of Germans
towards the members of the forces of occupation’.129 There was pity for
the malnourished children. Dorothy Dixon, also of the ATS, admitted
that ‘I could feel little compassion for the German men and women, but
the sight of near starving children appalled me and I broke many Army
orders by giving them food.’130 And there was deﬁance. Angela Mack of
the WRNS visited the Reich Chancellery in Berlin and, amid the ruins of
Hitler’s ofﬁce, ‘gave a silent “up yours” to the macabre Adolf’.131 When

discussions took place in the Admiralty about the participation of the
WRNS in the demobilisation of its German navy counterpart, the Marine
Helferinnen, one of the arguments used was that Wrens would bring ‘a
soupçon of hard-heartedness to stiffen a male disbandment organisation
which otherwise might be too tender-hearted to the German Women’s
Naval Service’.132

DEMOBILISATION AND THE CREATION
OF THE PERMANENT WOMEN’S SERVICES

Demobilisation
As early as 1941 the government began to plan for demobilisation and following lengthy discussions between the Ministry of Labour,
the three service departments and other relevant government agencies,
a release scheme for the armed forces was announced in the autumn of
1944.1 This was to come into effect at the end of hostilities in Europe.
Like their male counterparts, the bulk of servicewomen were to be
released in groups determined by a combination of age and length of
war service (known as category A release) with the oldest and longest
serving generally being demobilised before the rest. According to this
formula, two months of service was to be treated as the equivalent of
one additional year of age. Therefore, a woman of twenty-four with ﬁve
years of service would be in the same release group as a woman of thirty
with four years of service. In line with their male equivalents, provision
was also made for a small number of servicewomen with special skills to
be released regardless of age and length of service, in order to undertake
urgent reconstruction work (known as category B release).
Underpinning these arrangements, the Reinstatement in Civil
Employment Act of 1944 obliged employers to offer both servicemen
and women the civilian jobs they had occupied immediately before their
war service on terms and conditions no less favourable to them than if
they had not joined the forces. If this was not possible, employers were
required to provide the next best alternative.2

There were, however, differences between the male and female
release schemes. Whilst married servicemen, for example, were to
have no priority of release over their single male comrades, married
servicewomen were to be granted precedence over single female colleagues, if they so desired, in order to return to their marital homes as
quickly as possible. Furthermore, rather than being issued with
a civilian ‘demob’ suit on release, as was the intention for servicemen,
servicewomen were to be provided with a cash grant and clothing
coupons in order to purchase a civilian outﬁt to suit their individual
tastes.3 What these variations indicated were not only assumptions
about the importance of members of the women’s forces to the revival
of family life in post-war Britain but also about the desirability of
enabling them to dress fashionably and elegantly on their return to
civvy street. Penny Summerﬁeld remarks that ‘the message concerning
servicewomen was consistent with the return to gender norms
expected of all women’.4
Such gender norms were also incorporated in various educational schemes that helped to prepare female personnel for civilian
life. As Patricia Allatt has shown, the ground was prepared to some
degree by the booklets compiled by the War Ofﬁce to inform the
regular current affairs discussions that ATS ofﬁcers, like their male
opposite numbers in the army, were expected to conduct with their
subordinates during the war.5 One booklet about women’s roles in the
post-war world, written by William Emrys Williams, the Director of
the Army Bureau of Current Affairs, and issued to ofﬁcers in early
1944, offered pointed advice on how to counteract the arguments of
feminists if they appeared to be gaining the upper hand in a debate on
this topic:
In most discussions about women there comes a point at which
someone tosses a hand-grenade into the debate. The well-worn
phrase ‘Women’s place is the home’, for example, can be
depended upon to make the argument really explosive, for it
develops extremism on both sides. On the one hand it makes the
Grand Turk positively livid in his afﬁrmation that he is the
superior sex and that women’s role is subordinate to his. On
the other hand it goads the Ultra-Feminist into the preposterous
proposition that women have a right to do everything that men
do . . . .

If you ﬁnd that ‘Women’s place is the home’ is rousing a onesided opposition you might ﬁnd it salutary to balance things up
by taking a familiar feminist slogan to pieces.
‘A Woman Has a Right to a Career’
This slogan is usually repeated by upper-class feminists
whose women-friends practise the more elegant professions –
novelists, actresses, staff-managers and so on. It ignores the
grim fact that most women who work are inevitably employed
on rather wearisome jobs – such as ﬁlling bottles in factories.
The feminist extremists always overlook this fact and consequently glamourise the whole discussion. Is there really anything more attractive to a woman in the prospect of a job of her
own than in the prospect of a home of her own? Is this alleged
‘right to a career’, moreover, to apply in a competitive or sexcombative way? What reasonable ground may there be, for
instance, for the fear so many married soldiers express that
they will come back to ﬁnd women entrenched in their jobs?
What about biological differences and social responsibilities?
How do you equate women’s role as mothers with their role as
wage-earners?6
While Williams acknowledged that ‘from the experiences and experiments of wartime we may expect certain new trends to appear in the
post-war employment of women’, he suggested that ‘whatever else we
look forward to after the war we must put ﬁrst of all the principle that as
many women as possible should marry and have babies’.7
The gender conventions were, however, most evident in the
resettlement training courses organised for servicewomen in the run
up to their release. In the autumn of 1944, the directors of the women’s
forces were invited to give their views on the types of classes that would
be most beneﬁcial to their female personnel and they ‘stressed very
strongly the need for the provision of home management courses’:
A considerable number of the younger members of the
Women’s Services who were looking forward to the early establishment of a home had received no training and had missed the
normal opportunities for learning the art of home-making. It
was therefore of the greatest importance that full provision
should be made as far as resources allowed.8

204 / Demobilisation and the Permanent Women’s Services
Instruction in domestic subjects was prominent in the offerings for
servicewomen. An ATS ‘Home Training and Handicraft Centre’, for
example, was established at the Royal Ordnance Corps depot at
Donnington where the auxiliaries were able to acquire a knowledge of
‘cookery’, ‘housewifery’, ‘laundry’ and ‘dress-making’.9 ‘Efﬁcient
housewives and mothers’, it was observed, ‘are a better war memorial
than so much carved stone.’10 Elsewhere, WRNS ‘Housecraft’ vans,
ﬁtted with modern kitchens and household appliances, toured home
naval units to tutor Wrens in similar household tasks.11 Civilian bodies,
such as local education authorities and women’s institutes, were also
involved in these activities. It was reported that over a six-month period
in 1945, 654 ‘single lectures or demonstrations’, 184 ‘short courses’ and
190 ‘classes’ were arranged by various external organisations for the
women’s services on ‘mothercraft’, ‘housecraft’ and ‘domestic
science’.12 Those serving overseas were not forgotten either. The
WAAF, for instance, ran two-week courses on ‘home management’ for
airwomen in Palestine using a bungalow at Ramleh equipped as
a contemporary home.13
There were sometimes waiting lists for such classes and most
seemed to have appreciated the opportunities to learn basic domestic
skills.14 Elizabeth Watkins signed up for a week-long WAAF ‘brides
course’ at a seaside villa in Margate, where the students were given
‘imaginary families’ composed of two young children and a husband
working nine hours a day on the national weekly average wage of £5
and were taught how to manage a household budget and attend to the
domestic chores. ‘It was a good course,’ she recalled, ‘stressing that
budgeting time is as important as budgeting money. The immediate
beneﬁts were that I could now cook a meal, clean a house, and had
made myself a fetching dress in a deep pink angora wool.’15 The Royal
Air Force Quarterly commented that the attendance at the classes
provided for Waafs revealed that they were ‘deeply interested in the
domestic spheres of cookery, homecraft and mothercraft’.16 A few,
however, were sceptical of these offerings. Before her mixed antiaircraft battery was disbanded, Marian Mills attended a series of lectures for the ATS on ‘home management’, incorporating ‘shopping’,
‘dusting’, ‘home nursing’ and ‘mangling’, which she regarded as ‘prehistoric’. They were, in her estimation, ‘a hurried attempt to reorient our
minds towards women’s traditional role and away from dangerous
ideas of inﬁltrating male preserves in the workplace’.17

In June 1945, the release scheme commenced and female
personnel eligible for demobilisation were, as a general rule, discharged from the forces after the appropriate documentation and
other administrative procedures had been completed at dispersal centres or other designated service establishments in the UK.18 The
release process was not without its stresses and strains. There were
complaints from servicewomen about delays in bringing them home
from overseas. Such frustration led to a ‘sit-down strike’ by
a contingent of WAAF clerks at a RAF base in Egypt, during the
summer of 1945, over the non-appearance of troopships to repatriate
the airwomen. This dispute was only resolved after Felicity Peake,

1::79

who was now the senior WAAF staff ofﬁcer at RAF headquarters in
Cairo, had obtained an ofﬁcial explanation from the Air Ministry
about the shortage of suitable shipping and an assurance that
a vessel would soon be on its way to embark them.19 ‘They were
understandably fed up’, empathised Peake, ‘at being constantly
“fobbed off” with excuses.’20
There was also some criticism of the priority given to married
servicewomen in the release schedule. Such a preference, explained
Constance Woodhead in regard to the WAAF, proved particularly
irksome when married personnel exploited their marital status for
their own advantage:
As it turned out, some selﬁsh young wives claimed their priority
without the slightest intention of setting up house with their
husbands; this caused great heartburning among the older spinsters, who were anxious to get a good start in the race for
civilian jobs and whose releases were thereby delayed.21
Similar grievances surfaced in connection with the ATS. Major-General
Alan Pigott, the Director of Recruiting and Demobilisation at the War
Ofﬁce, outlined the dilemma facing the military authorities:
it was argued that it was both unnecessary and unfair that those
married women who had not lived with their husbands for years
and had no intention of doing so again should receive any
priority. The contention was perfectly true; some married
women obtained a priority for which there was no justiﬁcation.
But in practice there were no means of discovering these undeserving cases. It was not practicable to expect an ATS commanding ofﬁcer to ask each of the married women under her
command whether she intended to live with her husband, nor
was it likely that those who did not so intend would give
a truthful reply if they wanted an early release. In fact the
concession was inevitable, whether logical or not. Public opinion had never tolerated the call-up of married women, and
during the war much criticism was aroused by the refusal of the
Services to grant discharge to a woman on marriage. The married men in the Services would certainly expect that their wives
should be released at once, if they wished, to prepare their home
for their return. Love, which proverbially laughs at locksmiths,

1::79

207 / Demobilisation
would doubtless have laughed at any regulation which
attempted to retain married women until their group fell due
for release; and it is better that regulations should not be
laughed at.22
Another gripe was the value of the clothing grant given to demobilised
servicewomen. After hard negotiations with the Treasury, whose female
representative was convinced that a suitable outﬁt could be obtained for
£8 15s, a sum of £12 10s was settled on. This was based on the estimated
cost of certain utility-style items, including hat, scarf, raincoat, shoes,
stockings, blouse or jumper and ‘costume’, together with an alterations
allowance. There was, however, much grumbling that this grant was
insufﬁcient to equip women adequately for civilian life and did not appear
to be equal in value to the suit of clothing provided for servicemen.23
Leslie Whateley reported that among members of the ATS ‘dissatisfaction
was so general that I gave permission – and even encouraged them – to
write to me if after demobilization they had proof that the grant was
insufﬁcient. There was no question about the fact that they had my
sympathy’.24 The sum was subsequently raised to £13 16s.25
A further irritation that came to light was the disparity in the
war gratuity paid to servicemen and women on leaving the forces.
Female personnel were to be entitled to two thirds of the gratuity (a
payment in reward for war service) of the corresponding male ranks.26
According to Woodhead
some bitterness was felt at the apparent inequality of these
beneﬁts as between RAF and WAAF; but DWAAF [Mary
Welsh] refused to ask for a gratuity at the same rate as the
RAF, pointing out that it was illogical to accept two-thirds of
the RAF rate of pay for six years and then to demand an equal
rate of gratuity, since the latter was based on the accepted rank
and rate of pay.27
Meanwhile, pressure was exerted by parents for the early release of the
women. Whateley received pleading letters, as well as personal visits,
requesting the premature discharge of daughters from the ATS, but was
determined to hold ﬁrm in the face of such lobbying – especially from
those who thought that rank or position would earn them preferential
treatment. ‘Both those in the Service and their parents’, she insisted, ‘had
to be made to realize that if the rate of demobilization was speeded up

for the women, it could be only at the expense of those men who had
been serving overseas for so many years.’28
Despite these difﬁculties, the release arrangements seem to have
operated reasonably smoothly.29 By the end of 1946, approximately
350,000 female personnel had been discharged from the women’s services
under category A release and 4,000 under category B. The latter were
earmarked for such industries as clothing, textiles and shoe
manufacturing.30 ‘The demobilization scheme’, concluded Pigott, ‘was,
beyond question, successful in achieving a very difﬁcult operation without
major trouble.’31
The anticipation of a return to civvy street generated a range of
impulses. Many were attracted by the prospect of wedlock and
domesticity.32 Lady Violet Apsley estimated that on the basis of her experience as an honorary ATS welfare ofﬁcer in Gloucestershire, ‘probably about
75 per cent of the women in the Forces are looking forward in the future to
marriage and a home of their own’.33 Yet wartime service also spawned
a desire for travel and adventure that appeared to challenge the notion of
a conventional domestic existence. A Mass Observation report in 1944,
entitled The Journey Home, recorded that ‘wanderlust is very widespread in
the women’s Services. The uppermost feeling seems to be a negative one: ‘I’ll
never be able to settle down again.’34 This cross current was said to be partly
a result of the women’s services comprising a higher proportion of female
personnel from relatively afﬂuent backgrounds, compared to those in
industry, who could afford to indulge more stimulating post-war lifestyles.
But it was also put down to a number of ‘deeper’ explanations:
1. The life of the Service girl has been completely changed by the
war, more so than any other section of the community. Life
after the war has become simply a subject for imaginative
speculation.
2. Because her life is entirely devoted to the war, as one of our
observers in the WAAF remarks, ‘The war is an object in
itself, not a transitory period during which everything stops.’
3. The Service girl is often very young, many coming straight
from school. The future was vague before the war, and has
only become vaguer in the interval. She has no ready-made
life to which to return.
4. The Service girl is almost entirely cut off from civilian life.
Whereas the woman in industry returns home in the evening

1::79

and takes up the thread of home affairs, the Service woman has
only her periods of leave in which to ﬁnd a contact with her old
life.
5. The routines, uniforms, uniformities of Service life, necessarily more rigid than anything civilians know, built up the urge
to step out into new independences, individualities.
All these factors contribute to make the Service girl readier than her
counterpart in the factory, to take a leap forward into the
unknown.35
This sense of restlessness was corroborated by Joan Wyndham: ‘Five years
of regimentation – not to mention those ten years at the convent – have left
me with a lust for liberty that has to be satisﬁed’, she confessed during the
autumn of 1945, when contemplating her release from the WAAF, ‘and all
I really want now with all my heart is to be let off the leash – to be
gloriously, totally and dangerously free.’36
Whatever their hopes for the future, the experience of demobilisation could be an unsettling one for servicewomen. There was a sense of
isolation after the close comradeship of the forces. Phyllis Smart completed
her discharge from the WAAF with a solemn handshake from a female
ofﬁcer and a brisk ‘Thank you for coming’: ‘I was out! I have never felt so
forsaken in my life. After being part of a huge family for so long, I was on
my own. I lay in bed that night and cried.’37 There were strains in readjusting to life in the parental home. After her departure from the WRNS, Joan
Dunhill’s family ‘seemed to ﬁnd it hard to accept that you were no longer
just a young girl, but a mature and changed adult who had learned to stand
on her own feet and make her own decisions’.38 And there were anxieties
about resuming married life. As J. Myler poignantly recounted, she and her
spouse were virtual strangers after lengthy war service apart:
There was also the knowledge that my husband was on his way
back to me. Knowledge that made me glow and tingle from head to
foot, but at the same time I was apprehensive. So many years had
passed since our wedding day and those few short hours we were
together and I knew his life must have been so different in Burma,
the extent of which I only discovered much later and I realised that
he would have changed, but how much and in what way? I knew
I had changed since he went away and I wondered if he would be
able to accept those changes and feel the same about me.

210 / Demobilisation and the Permanent Women’s Services
Right now I had to face the fact that from this moment my life
would be very different, just as it was so different when I joined
the WAAF. Whether or not my husband and I would be able to
cope with so much that would not only be strange, but perhaps
difﬁcult and certainly unknown was something that only time
would tell. One thing I did without doubt know, and that was
that I was going to have a damned good try.39
Furthermore, there were frustrations for those who returned to comparatively mundane civilian jobs. Liz Sealey, formerly of the WRNS,
noticed that ‘those who had been there all during the war did pay a great
deal of attention to such trivia as to how many paper clips one had used,
and such like. It did, for a little while, seem rather petty after Service
life’.40 Mary Palmer, recently of the WAAF, found herself ‘bored stiff
after nearly four years of intense work and everything happening round
me’.41 Angela Mack was surprised at the extent of ‘prejudice against
women from men’ in the workplace following her stint with the Wrens:
this was very strange at ﬁrst to us, who had worked in the
services alongside men and had got used to it, felt quite relaxed
about it and had developed a good working rapport. Our ﬁrst
thought was that a lot of men in the business world were weird,
neolithic creatures whose attitudes were scandalously out of
date. We hoped they would soon wake up to reality.42
Some renegotiated their working identities. Marjorie Hazell related that her
close comrade Rene, an ex-WAAF driver, stuck to her pre-war trade as
a dressmaker for only a short period after release: ‘She missed the outdoor
life, and the freedom of the MT [motor transport] Section, and looked
around for a more mobile job. She found it on the platform of a London
bus.’43 In contrast, Dinny Law, an ex-WRNS ship mechanic (landing craft),
emphatically rejected her wartime incarnation: ‘After the war, I decided
never ever to do a man’s job again and found the most feminine job I could
at Cyclax of London. I learned to massage faces and make them up.’44
Whatever their individual experiences, Helen Forrester commented ruefully on a lack of public recognition for the returning servicewomen:
For years afterwards, one would come across brick walls with
Welcome Home Joey or George or Henry, splashed across it, in
drippy, faded whitewash.

I never saw such a message painted for the Marys,
Margarets, Dorothys and Ellens, who also served. It was
still a popular idea that women did not need things. They
could make do. They could manage without, even without
welcomes.45

The Creation of the Permanent Women’s Services: The
Assheton Report
Discussions over the long-term future of the women’s forces
began in earnest in 1943. Early that year Violet Markham and Thelma
Cazalet-Keir (the latter having served on the 1942 Markham committee) visited the Deputy Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, to ascertain
what consideration was being given to section nineteen of the
Markham report which raised the issue of the continuation of the
women’s services after the war: ‘are the auxiliaries to vanish from the
scene and be lost in the shadows of demobilisation?’, the authors had
enquired in their report. In response, Attlee suggested that an ad hoc
committee, incorporating representatives from the various departments
concerned, be set up to look into the matter and this was approved by
the War Cabinet.46
In the spring of 1943, such a committee was duly established
under the chairmanship of Ralph Assheton, the ﬁnancial secretary to
the Treasury. It was asked to make recommendations on the future of
the three women’s auxiliary services. In order to arrive at its judgements, the committee sought the preliminary views of the respective
service ministries. All three departments acknowledged that in any
new major war women’s forces would once again have to be mobilised
on a large scale and that both they and the Ministry of Labour wished
to avoid the ‘delays and difﬁculties’ that had been encountered at the
start of the present conﬂict. Yet there were varying departmental
perspectives on the organisation of these services in peacetime. If
circumstances permitted, the Air Ministry was in favour of retaining
a slimmed down WAAF on a regular footing, supplemented by
a reserve organisation, which would continue to carry out duties
with the RAF. In contrast, the War Ofﬁce wished to maintain the
nucleus of a permanent ATS, together with a reserve force, but the
former would fulﬁl a purely administrative, training and mobilisation
role. The Admiralty was less enthusiastic. Its stance was that while it
would be advantageous to operate a reserve of women to be called up
for naval service as required, probably overseen by a permanent skeleton headquarters’ staff, there would be ‘no room’ for any regular
women’s organisation comparable to the WRNS. The reasons for this,
it was claimed, were due to the ‘special circumstances’ of the Royal
Navy. These included the necessity of maintaining a constant ﬂow of

1::79

213 / The Assheton Report
naval personnel between the three types of service that sailors were
required to undertake in peacetime (home shore, home sea and foreign) and ensuring that their service was evenly divided between these
three categories. A sizeable WRNS would decrease the number of
shore jobs available at home and thus ‘conﬂict with this essential
feature of the Naval Service’. It was also contended that for every
Wren employed, one fewer active service male rating would be available for the ﬂeet in wartime.47
The heads of the three women’s forces at the time were also
consulted. Jane Trefusis Forbes strongly supported the notion of
a regular WAAF. She proposed that its establishment should be a ﬁxed
percentage of the RAF establishment and that it be employed largely in
the more skilled roles for which advanced technical training was
required. To support her case, she pointed out that since a signiﬁcant
number of airwomen served side by side with airmen on operational
stations, it would be inefﬁcient to organise a peacetime WAAF except on
the basis of a permanent enterprise. She also argued that such a force
would allow parents to become ‘habituated to the idea of their daughters belonging to a service’ and that it would ‘maintain the necessary
sense of trust amongst the members of the RAF in the capacity of women
to undertake work of a technical nature with the Air Force’. ‘The need to
create this trust’, she added, ‘had been a hampering feature in the
present war at the beginning.’48 Jean Knox stated that in her view the
‘minimum requirement’ after the war would be to retain the nucleus of
a regular ATS. Without such a body of trained women, she stressed, ‘the
strain imposed on those who would suddenly become responsible for
creating a service from nothing would be excessive’.49 As for Vera
Laughton Mathews, she suggested – perhaps at variance with her
naval colleagues – that a small regular WRNS was necessary in order
‘to keep the Service as a living organisation’ and that it need not disrupt
the rotations of the Royal Navy if it undertook jobs in peacetime naval
establishments which would normally be ﬁlled by civilian women.50 All
three senior ofﬁcers agreed that a ‘high proportion’ of female personnel
hoped that the women’s services would remain in place after the end of
hostilities and ‘provide them with an opportunity for a permanent
career’.51 Markham herself was sounded out too. She recognised that
there were many factors to be taken into account when considering
whether the women’s forces should continue in peacetime, but that
there was ‘positive advantage’ in employing women in such military

capacities as they had a ‘humanising inﬂuence’ and ‘for certain work
were more suitable than men’.52
During the course of their deliberations, the representatives of
the service departments on the Assheton committee understandably
endorsed the positions of their respective ministries. The non-service
members, it was recorded, drew attention to arguments in favour of
regular women’s services. These included the ‘number of spheres in the
Services for which women have a special aptitude’, the belief that ‘the
presence of Service women in Service Establishments is advantageous
from the point of view of morale’, and the ‘continuous educative effect
on Service and public opinion’ which, however efﬁcient a system of
reserves might be, would ‘better ensure an adequate supply of trained
women to be mobilised for the enlarged Women’s Services which would
be needed in time of war’.53
In its report, completed during the summer of 1943, the committee acknowledged that it was difﬁcult to formulate detailed plans for
the peacetime women’s services until the conﬁguration of the post-war
armed forces had been decided and the budgetary position was clearer.
Nevertheless, it made some tentative recommendations. These largely
followed the lead of the individual service ministries and entailed
a permanent, if smaller, WAAF to undertake RAF duties along existing
lines; a permanent ATS nucleus to perform administrative, training and
mobilisation functions, together with a reserve force; and, whilst it was
accepted that there were practical objections to a regular WRNS on ‘an
active footing’, a permanent WRNS headquarters, augmented by
a reserve organisation.54 The War Cabinet approved these proposals,
but a statement was made by Churchill in the House of Commons that
the future of the women’s services after demobilisation could not be
determined separately from the armed forces as a whole and that the
time had not yet arrived to decide policy on this matter. Reassurances
were given, however, that the women’s organisations would be required
for some time after the conclusion of hostilities.55

Deliberations within the Air Ministry
Towards the end of 1944, the RAF authorities examined in
more detail the likelihood of a regular WAAF as envisaged in the
Assheton report. With the end of the war in sight, an Air Ministry
committee tasked with looking into the manning of the post-war RAF

revisited the merits of the case. The committee’s starting point was that
in a future major conﬂict manpower considerations would make it
‘imperative’ to utilise women in the armed forces to the ‘maximum
extent possible’ and it was thus vital to maintain a women’s reserve.
Yet the prospect of operating a regular WAAF, as well as a reserve, was
regarded as more problematic.
A number of arguments were set out in favour of such
a standing force. It was asserted, for example, that as far as possible,
the RAF should be organised along the same pattern in peacetime as it
would be in wartime and that women should thus be closely assimilated
into its post-war structure. Besides, only by retaining a permanent
WAAF could it be ensured that the necessary continuous experience
was acquired to enable women to be allotted to the most appropriate air
force trades and that the standards of discipline and efﬁciency necessary
in an expanded wartime service could be nurtured. In addition, if a large
RAF was required after the end of hostilities and it was not possible to
recruit male personnel of the right quality, women might be needed to
supplement the available manpower, particularly given they were
‘unquestionably better than men on certain duties’. Furthermore, not
only was it desirable that the public should be ‘educated and accustomed to the continued employment of women in the Services’ but also
if there was to be ‘full and cordial co-operation’ between the genders,
the latter needed to come to view the former’s employment with the
RAF as routine: ‘Only so will it be possible to avoid the difﬁculties which
have arisen in the past as a result of antagonism and prejudice in the
Service against the introduction of women.’ Women, moreover, had
‘played their part’ in the wartime RAF and would ‘expect to take their
share in the post-war regular forces’. They might well resent being
forced into a non-regular service and this could limit recruitment for
a reserve. In any case, it would be problematic to organise and train
a women’s reserve if there were no WAAF schools or similar units
staffed by female personnel on a permanent basis.
Various grounds against a standing service were also laid out.
The incorporation of women in a regular WAAF, it was claimed, would
give rise to ‘problems of administration, training and accommodation’,
the overhead costs of which would be far greater than the beneﬁts
obtained from their employment. In particular, the marriage wastage
rate alone would make them ‘wholly uneconomical’. The Registrar
General’s reports indicated, for example, that if the average age at

entry was nineteen, the annual wastage from marriage would be
7.4 per cent. When this was added to the higher wastage rates than
men from other causes, along with the increased incidence of sickness, it
was calculated that it would be necessary to enlist annually about three
times as many women as men to ﬁll the equivalent number of posts.
Likewise, experience had shown that women were unable, in many
cases, to fulﬁl all the tasks associated with the jobs they were undertaking, such as station defence duties, and further costs would be
incurred because of the need to employ more male personnel at RAF
establishments. What was more, the deployment of women overseas
would be limited by climatic and other factors, such as the nonavailability of appropriate amenities, and this would lead to a ‘lack of
ﬂexibility and mobility’. To aggravate matters, whilst the command of
men by women had been ‘accepted to a limited extent in war time, it
might be resented as a general rule under peace conditions and so lead to
friction and discontent’. As for the women themselves, although they
might have been ‘willing and anxious’ to do all they could to aid the war
effort and would have expected appropriate roles to be made available
to them for this purpose, ‘these arguments would not hold good in peace
time’. It was thus likely that many would not be prepared to sign up for
full-time employment in a regular WAAF. This could make it hard to
secure suitable ofﬁcers and NCOs.56
The preference of the DWAAF, now Mary Welsh, was for
a regular service, covering a wide spectrum of RAF duties, supported
by a reserve. The manning committee was, however, divided on the best
way forward and unable to give a clear lead.57 In early 1945, the matter
was referred to the Air Ministry’s post-war planning committee. This
came down in favour of proceeding on the basis that there should be
a peacetime reserve but no regular WAAF. The planning committee was
swayed in particular by the costs of maintaining a standing organisation, the problems in obtaining competent female ofﬁcers and NCOs to
run it, and the fact that it would inevitably displace trained men who
would be urgently needed as the core of an expanded RAF in wartime.58
Yet when this decision came to the attention of the new air
member for personnel, Air Marshal Sir John Slessor, he was doubtful
it was the correct one. He studied the reasoning for and against a regular
WAAF, as formulated by the manning committee, and found the case
against to be not of ‘much substance’ whilst the case in favour to be
‘unanswerable’ in several respects. In his opinion, the clinching

217 / Deliberations within the War Ofﬁce
argument was that in a future war the RAF would need to draw on
signiﬁcant numbers of women – ‘which no-one contests’ – and therefore
a regular WAAF was a sine-qua-non of a credible women’s service in the
opening phases of such a conﬂict, since a reserve was unlikely to be ﬁt
enough to play an immediate part on its own: ‘Few will deny that the
WAAF was very largely ineffective during the ﬁrst year of war because it
had no foundation of experience, organisation or training.’ Slessor
asked the Air Council to reverse the verdict of the post-war planning
committee and give its consent to a post-war regular WAAF, supplemented by a reserve.59
In the Air Council’s discussion of this matter in the summer of
1945, there was some hesitancy about the Air Ministry acting unilaterally. The view was expressed that this question should be considered in
relation to the intentions of the other two service departments and that
there were ‘important political implications’ which would have to be
evaluated. ‘Women might claim’, it was suggested, ‘that, having proved
their ﬁtness in war, they should have access to the three Services like
other members of the community despite possible objections on the
score of economy.’ It was agreed that a draft cabinet paper be drawn
up.60
This paper, which was drafted in August 1945, explained that
while there was a general consensus that reserve organisations should be
maintained in peacetime, the embodiment of regular forces was a more
complex affair. This involved questions of whether there were ‘sound
Defence reasons’ for such institutions; whether the costs would be
‘worth while’; and whether there would be public pressure for women
to be allowed to have a career in a military service, as did those in the
civil service, on the grounds that ‘they have amply proved their ﬁtness
for a wide range of Service duties’. It was proposed that a new interdepartmental committee be set up to devise a common policy for the
three armed forces.61

Deliberations within the War Ofﬁce
The army authorities had been reassessing their own position in
the aftermath of the Assheton report. Over the course of 1944, the War
Ofﬁce post-war army problems committee had mulled over the question
of a regular ATS and not only recommended that a small standing
service be retained in peacetime, supplemented by a reserve, but also

218 / Demobilisation and the Permanent Women’s Services
suggested that its female personnel might perform certain military duties
in addition to the administrative, training and mobilisation roles envisaged at the time of the Assheton inquiry. Yet in early 1945 the executive
committee of the Army Council had cast doubt on these aspirations by
questioning if the costs of such a force would be justiﬁed given the likely
available funds. The matter was referred back to the post-war problems
committee for further reﬂection.62
During this committee’s reconsideration of this matter, which
involved the participation of Leslie Whateley, who was much in favour
of a regular ATS, compelling arguments were made in support of
a standing force. It was agreed that the ‘real case’ rested on the conviction that the manpower situation in the future ‘will not permit of
mobilization for a national war without the use of women in the
Services’. Linked to this was the admission that the ATS had ‘undoubtedly suffered from having been born late’. Its senior ofﬁcers and NCOs,
for example, now had only six years of service experience behind them,
rather than the twenty-ﬁve to thirty years of their male counterparts.
Furthermore, in the early period of the conﬂict, the ATS had been
‘seriously handicapped because of the fact that the Army did not then
understand or appreciate the employment of women on a duty which, in
peace, had been regarded as essentially a man’s job’. Overall, it was
estimated that as a result of the ‘lack of preparation’ for war, the rapidly
expanding ATS had lost the equivalent of approximately 50 per cent of
its strength through ‘inefﬁciency’ during the period between 1939 and
1941. A regular force was thus required, since there was a great deal of
difference between ‘expansion from a germ and building up a complete
organisation from nothing’. It was reckoned, moreover, that if the peacetime regular army had recruiting difﬁculties, a standing ATS could
usefully make up for a shortage of regulars and that ‘there are certain
duties which are more efﬁciently done by women than by men’.63
In the summer of 1945, the post-war army problems committee
reported back to the executive committee of the Army Council. There
were, it was stated, two separate but interconnected aspects to the question: the need to ensure the ‘full and early use’ of women in an expanded
wartime army; and the possibility of utilising women in the smaller peacetime ‘active army’ as a means of increasing its effective embodied strength.
The ﬁrst aspect was believed to be uncontroversial. Shortages of manpower had made it necessary to employ signiﬁcant numbers of women
across the armed forces in two world wars. Not only was it considered

1::79

219 / Deliberations within the Admiralty
axiomatic that women would once again be required for service in a large
future conﬂict but it was also evident that one of the chief hurdles
encountered by the ATS in the early phase of the present war had been
the difﬁculties of rapidly expanding the service without the existence of
a permanent nucleus on which to build: ‘Our endeavour to do so was, for
a long period, most wasteful both in personnel and in loss of efﬁciency’. It
was thus recommended that a small regular ATS, supported by a reserve,
be maintained in order to expedite this anticipated expansion. Some of this
force would be involved in ‘staff, administration, training, recruiting’ with
the rest undertaking selected military duties with the army.
The second aspect was considered more contentious. If the
principal constraining factor in the size of the ‘active army’ was
a shortage of manpower, then there was a strong case for a larger regular
ATS to augment it. If, however, the chief constraining factor was
ﬁnance, then the justiﬁcation for a more substantial ATS would be
diminished. Special accommodation and additional overheads required
for such a women’s service would make it costly to maintain, regardless
of the savings in lower pay. In addition, from the viewpoint of ‘all-round
usefulness’ in an army mainly needed for overseas service, they would be
‘individual for individual, of less value than men’.64
The executive committee of the Army Council gave its
approval to a small regular ATS, together with a reserve, but was
reluctant to make a judgement on a larger standing service because it
was not yet possible to predict the ﬁnancial limitations under which
the post-war armed forces would operate.65 Shortly after this, the War
Ofﬁce was asked to associate itself with the Air Ministry’s draft
cabinet paper and join a new inter-departmental committee to consider the question of permanent women’s services. The army authorities declined on the grounds that their planning was already at an
advanced stage and their involvement in such a forum would achieve
little. Yet they were willing to discuss the matter at the inter-service
consultative body on post-war organisational and administrative problems (known as PICB), a committee that operated under the aegis of
the War Ofﬁce.66

Deliberations Within the Admiralty
The naval authorities also reviewed their policy as outlined in
the Assheton report. In the summer of 1945, the Admiralty’s naval

220 / Demobilisation and the Permanent Women’s Services
personnel reconstruction committee, which had been tasked with reexamining the merits of a permanent WRNS, reported that it could ﬁnd
no grounds to depart from the position as laid out in 1943. A large
regular WRNS, it was opined, would greatly diminish the number of
‘home shore billets’ available for male ratings and would ‘certainly be
resented by the Lower Deck’. As for a small regular WRNS, other than
a headquarters staff, it was doubted that this would ‘prove of any value
as a basis for expansion’. It was thus concluded that unless it was found
impossible to recruit enough men for the peacetime Royal Navy, a postwar women’s naval service would only continue as a reserve
organisation.67
In tandem with this, there was a belief within the Admiralty, as
outlined in its submission to the Royal Commission on Equal Pay in
1945, that from the ‘limited experience’ of utilising women under war
conditions, it was not possible to draw any ‘sound conclusions’ about
the extent to which they could be successfully employed in a permanent
peacetime WRNS across the variety of roles normally undertaken
by men:
It is of course clear from the very fact that women are not
employed in ships of war at sea, that in the Naval Service
women cannot be regarded as carrying out the full range of
duties that fall to men. Apart from this, accurate comparison is
made impossible by factors such as the complete absence of any
objective analysis or statistical survey of the results achieved by
women, the policy of utilising men on the physically arduous
tasks (except for ships cooks), the training of women in the
limited ﬁeld of the duties of a rating on which they are likely
to be employed contrasted with the wider training necessarily
given to a man even in war time, because he is likely to be sent to
a ship, and the relative educational and mental quality of men
and women recruited into the Naval Service in war. The last
factor is of special importance. The popularity of the WRNS
combined with the small numbers required has enabled the
WRNS recruiting authorities to pick and choose, with the result
that speaking generally the WRNS comprises women of good
education and bright intellect of a standard that is deﬁnitely
higher than the average war-entered man who remains
a rating . . . . There is no doubt, in the Admiralty view, that the

1::79

221 / Joint Proposals to the Defence Committee
success which has attended the employment of Wrens in certain
technical posts previously conﬁned to men is in part due to the
exceptionally high quality of the girls recruited for the WRNS.68
Meanwhile, the naval authorities received the Air Ministry’s draft cabinet paper with its call for inter-service consultations. The DWRNS,
Laughton Mathews, urged her department to participate and also
took the opportunity to sound a dissenting note. Although she admitted
that the matter was ‘rather outside DWRNS’ sphere’, she nonetheless
argued that if women’s services were to be required in a future conﬂict,
the retention of small, active regular forces, combined with reserves,
were the most efﬁcient means of securing their swift involvement after
the outbreak of hostilities. She also posited that ‘permanent Women’s
Services should exercise a very good effect on the morale of the Forces in
peace-time especially for those stationed in isolated places’.69 The naval
authorities agreed that it would be beneﬁcial to engage in discussions
with the other armed forces.70

Joint Proposals to the Defence Committee
In the autumn of 1945, the three service departments began
joint consultations at PICB.71 At this stage, the War Ofﬁce had settled
on a small regular peacetime ATS, the Admiralty was ill-disposed
towards an equivalent WRNS and the Air Ministry was still undecided
on the shape of a future WAAF. During the course of these discussions,
Air Marshal Slessor went back to the Air Council early in 1946 in the
hope of persuading it to make a ﬁrm decision on a regular post-war
WAAF, so that agreed inter-service proposals could be put to the cabinet. He argued that without such a women’s force its members would be
consenting to a RAF shorn of an essential wartime component which
could not be recreated in under a period of eighteen months to two
years. What was more, they might well be condemning the RAF to
a deﬁcit in what was considered the minimum peacetime operating
level if womanpower was not available to make up for a possible shortfall of male recruits.72 Although some doubts were expressed as to
whether a career in a uniformed military service would prove attractive
to women, this time the Air Council gave its consent.73
The naval authorities were having second thoughts too. One of
the chief objections to a regular WRNS was that it would interfere with

the provision of proper periods of home shore service for male ratings.
Yet it had become apparent that in certain branches of the Royal Navy,
such as those which formed part of its air arm, the likely makeup of the
future ﬂeet would result in an ‘unduly high’ proportion of home shore
service. This was considered ‘undesirable in itself’ and would result in
‘invidious comparisons’ with service in other naval branches. The institution of a small regular WRNS would help to remedy this imbalance
and bring the proportion of home shore service back into line across the
service. In addition, it was now recognised that a standing WRNS would
allow a reserve organisation to be better prepared for wartime than
would otherwise be the case and prevent the repetition of an ‘experimental period’ as had occurred in 1939 to 1940. Furthermore, there was
an acceptance that if, as seemed likely, there was a shortage of manpower for the peacetime Royal Navy, women would provide ‘a most
useful increment to ﬁll the gap between supply and demand’ and that in
a number of jobs ‘the woman is generally more efﬁcient than the man’. It
was conceded, moreover, that at remote naval establishments, in particular, ‘the presence of uniformed women had a psychological value and
tended to maintain the men’s morale’. In any event, it was anticipated
that if the army and the RAF maintained regular women’s forces there
would be ‘constant public and political pressure’ on the Admiralty to
come into line with the other service departments.74
When this matter came before the First Lord of the Admiralty,
A. V. Alexander, in the spring of 1946 he was not convinced by the
change of heart. His inclination was that ‘it would be of doubtful wisdom
to attempt to maintain active Women’s Services in peace-time’. The
Royal Navy, he pointed out, would be the smallest of the peacetime
services and funding would be limited; the likely work output of the
WRNS, along with the extra costs of women’s accommodation, would
make it cheaper to employ male ratings; and the nature of naval service
meant that it would in any case be necessary to train some men in peace to
fulﬁl tasks normally undertaken by the WRNS in war. ‘Hence’, he cautioned, ‘we should not be too ready to follow other services in this
matter’.75 Nevertheless, on the advice of the Admiralty Board, which
was under pressure from the other service ministries to ﬁnalise its position
so that a joint submission could be made to the cabinet, he reluctantly
agreed to a regular WRNS.76
In early May 1946, an inter-services memorandum on the ‘organisation of the women’s services in peace’ was duly submitted to the

1::79

223 / Joint Proposals to the Defence Committee
cabinet’s defence committee. By way of background, it was explained
that
All experience has shown that lack of manpower is one of the
strict limitations on this country’s capacity to wage a major war.
It has accordingly been necessary, both in this and in the last
war, to employ women on a very considerable scale in all the
Armed Forces. It would appear certain that, in a future war,
similar or perhaps even greater requirements will arise for the
employment of women in the Royal Navy, the Army and the
Royal Air Force.
‘One of the main lessons learned from the development of the Women’s
Services in this war’, the document continued, ‘has been the impossibility of bringing about a rapid expansion without some peace-time
basis of experience, organisation and training’; and, further to this, it
would be ‘impossible to maintain in peace-time a reserve which would
be ready and able to play an immediate part in the opening stage of
another war without the backing of a small Regular force which would
provide the basis on which to mobilize’. ‘It is also important,’ the paper
added,
if full co-operation is to be assured between men and women in
the Services and the difﬁculties which arise from prejudice are to
be avoided, that the employment of women on full-time duties
should come to be regarded as a natural incident of Service life.
The service authorities thus proposed that not only was it essential to
maintain post-war women’s reserve organisations, but also that regular
women’s forces needed to be established. These standing institutions
would facilitate the deployment of the reserves in an emergency and
perform a variety of military tasks for their parent services. What was
conceived was a regular WAAF of approximately 8,000 women;
a WRNS of between 2,000 and 6,000; and an ATS of some 3,000. The
WAAF would be employed across ‘a wide range of duties’; the WRNS
would focus on ‘branches where they have shown themselves to be
better at the particular work concerned’; and the ATS likewise on
‘jobs at which women have already shown their superiority’. In the
case of the ATS, it was envisaged that women would be employed in
non-domestic trades such as ‘the working of ofﬁce and statistical

1::79

224 / Demobilisation and the Permanent Women’s Services
machinery, mechanical and technical signal equipment and store keeping, together with certain operational duties in anti-aircraft’.77
During the defence committee’s discussion of the memorandum, the Home Secretary, James Chuter Ede, raised some concerns
about whether the women’s services would impact on his department’s
civil defence organisation in a future war – particularly in view of the
threats in the new atomic age – since the latter would again rely heavily
on women. Nonetheless, the committee agreed that regular women’s
forces should be established. In fact, it was suggested that if female
recruits were given training in the services as ‘typists, book-keepers
and domestics’ then on discharge they might usefully plug a gap in the
civilian labour market by helping to meet the urgent requirements for
these categories of workers.78 At the end of May, the Minister of Labour
and National Service, George Isaacs, announced in the House of
Commons that a decision had been taken ‘to continue the WRNS, the
ATS, and the WAAF on a voluntary basis as permanent features of the
Forces of the Crown’ and a statement to this effect appeared in
a government white paper outlining plans for the post-war call-up of
men for military service.79 In regard to her service, Laughton Mathews
described the establishment of a regular WRNS as ‘the ﬁnest monument
to the work of Wrens during the war’:
It still seems wonderful that the Royal Navy, the very heart of
the British tradition and probably the most conservative institution in the world, should have opened its doors to women. The
decision was, of course, very largely due to the manpower
situation and the necessity of cutting down the numbers of
men in the Services, but all the same, the Navy was with us.
The news came at the right moment, when the war was just over
and the WRNS stock high and all the Navy were ready to
welcome us.80
Yet, as she philosophically remarked, the public reaction to the creation
of these peacetime forces was distinctly underwhelming:
The announcement in regard to the ‘regular’ Women’s Services
was received in a most remarkable way. Knowing that this
revolutionary change was due to be made public, I and others
were in a state of excitement, rushing for papers, listening to the
radio, and certainly expecting splash headlines . . . [But] so

1::79

225 / Joint Proposals to the Defence Committee
much interest and controversy were aroused by the terms of
conscription for men that the paragraph [in the white paper]
referring to the Women’s Services passed unnoticed. There was
barely a comment. Not a paper gave it a headline or even
printed it in heavy type . . . The complete acceptance of the
Women’s Services could not have been better demonstrated.81
Pending the formal establishment of the regular women’s forces, opportunities were provided for those still serving in the ATS, WAAF and
WRNS, as well as those who had recently been released, to enter into an
extended service engagement.82 Meanwhile, preparations were made
for the formation of the new standing institutions. The titles of these
services evoked considerable internal discussion. The Admiralty was
content to retain ‘Women’s Royal Naval Service’ for its force, but the
Air Ministry and the War Ofﬁce wished to devise new names for their
respective women’s organisations. It was believed that the words ‘auxiliary’ and ‘territorial’ in the current titles were ‘inappropriate’ and
‘misleading’ for regular women’s services.83 The prime minister,
Clement Attlee, was reluctant to see the designations altered for some
‘pedantic reason’:84
It is always unfortunate to change the name of a Service when
the name has gathered round it a great amount of goodwill and
honour. The fact that the present names are not exactly applicable to the future Services does not seem to me necessarily
conclusive. My own Regiment was called the ‘Prince of Wales
Volunteers’ although a regular unit.85
Nevertheless, the Air Ministry and the War Ofﬁce pressed their case and
permission was eventually obtained to adopt new titles. The RAF
authorities, after toying with such names as the ‘Royal Air Force
(Women’s Section)’, the ‘Women’s Royal Air Service’, and the
‘Women of the Royal Air Force’, opted for the Women’s Royal Air
Force (WRAF) – a revival of its original name from the First World
War.86 The army authorities, following ﬂirtations with the ‘Princess
Royal’s Women’s Regiment’, the ‘Royal Women’s Regiment’ and the
‘Royal Army Women’s Service’, settled on the Women’s Royal Army
Corps (WRAC).87 In so doing the War Ofﬁce rejected a plea from the
ATS old comrades’ association – with Helen Gwynne-Vaughan one of
the chief protagonists – that the term ‘Women’s’ be omitted from any

new title. This request was on the grounds that it had been ‘one of our
sources of pride that the Army could recognise its corps of women
without a reiterated reference to their sex’ and it had given the service
a certain ‘superiority over the corresponding bodies of the Navy and
Royal Air Force, the names of both of which have always begun with
“Women’s”’.88 Gywnne-Vaughan was, however, politely informed that
although the new name might disappoint her, the deliberations had been
‘long and difﬁcult’ and it was ‘probably the best that could have been
selected’.89 Some in the service were not quite so certain. One female
corporal mused that ‘“Wrac” sounds a bit like “wreck” to me and
someone is sure to get around to “Wreck of the Hesparus”’.90
Other aspects of the new regular women’s forces also stimulated
debate. In the War Ofﬁce, as Lucy Noakes has demonstrated, there were
animated exchanges over the introduction of weapons training for
members of the WRAC.91 The DATS, Mary Tyrwhitt, who had
replaced Leslie Whateley in the spring of 1946, believed that even if
‘the WRAC do not go forth to meet the enemy’, given the use of
paratroops and other deep-penetration forces in modern warfare, the
enemy was ‘more than likely to come to the WRAC’. She therefore
proposed that consideration should be given to teaching the WRAC to
use small arms as defensive weapons:
In these days when the enemy may be largely uncivilised, I feel
that most women would rather put their trust in their own skill
with a riﬂe than in the ﬁner feelings of an invading army. It
might also relieve a Commander’s mind (and his available manpower) if the women on his establishment were capable of
defending themselves instead of being dependent upon his few
men for their protection. There are many precedents for this in
history.92
However, not only were there concerns about public opposition to such
a measure – ‘the arming of women in any circumstances’, it was opined,
‘is distasteful to the British people’93 – but also the prospect of guntoting WRACs was clearly anathema to some senior male ofﬁcers. The
Director of Staff Duties, Major-General Richard Hull, was particularly
forthright on the issue:
With the possible exception of those manning AA gun sites . . .
I consider that it would be psychologically unsound and an

1::79

227 / Joint Proposals to the Defence Committee
expensive waste of equipment, ammunition and training time to
train women in the use of personal arms. The fact that ‘little Olga’
is trained to kill and prides herself on the number of notches cut
on her revolver butt [presumably a reference to the Soviet Union’s
use of female snipers during the war] is no reason why we, too,
should cry ‘Annie get your gun’. It is still the soldier’s duty to
protect his womenfolk whatever they are wearing. Even in these
days when war means total war let us at least retain that degree of
chivalry.94
It was not until 1980 that the government announced that servicewomen would be trained in the use of arms.95
At times, negotiations over the details of the permanent women’s
services could be a fraught experience for those concerned. During
a meeting in the Air Ministry to discuss the issue of illegitimate pregnancies
in the WRAF, Felicity Peake, who (as Felicity Hanbury) had taken over as
DWAAF from Mary Welsh in late 1946, became so irate with her male
colleagues that she left in disgust:
I listened, spellbound, to these men discussing, apparently in all
sincerity, what punishment they should mete out to any airwoman or WRAF ofﬁcer who became illegitimately pregnant.
I was fascinated; I could hardly believe my ears. No one referred
to me for my opinion. Eventually I could stand it no longer and
burst out, ‘And what do you propose to do to the men
involved?’ – there had been no mention of men – ‘Promote
them to Air Marshals, I suppose?’ Then I stormed out of the
meeting. I knew I had behaved very badly, but I was so incensed
that I didn’t care what happened.96
On other occasions, more subtle tactics were employed. Peake found
out that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, favoured
a separate pay scale for servicewomen, unrelated to the men’s scale –
a decision, she feared, that would result in protracted arguments over
women’s pay rates every time the men’s rates were increased and make
the prospect of eventual parity in pay more remote. So she arranged for
Caroline Haslett, an old friend of the Cripps family, who she had met
when the engineer gave a lecture at the WAAF ofﬁcers’ school, to ‘beard
the Chancellor in his den’:

When the news came through that she had persuaded Sir
Stafford to change his views in our favour I was overcome
with joy. I remember literally dancing round my ofﬁce. Any
outsider coming in at that time would undoubtedly have
thought that we had all gone mad; for as the news spread,
everyone seemed to come bursting into the ofﬁce to join in the
dancing!97

Inauguration
Despite such behind-the-scenes wrangling, in 1948 an Army
and Air Force (Women’s Service) Act was passed, which gave effect to
the government’s decision to form regular women’s services, and on
1 February 1949 the WRAF and WRAC were inaugurated, with the
permanent WRNS instituted on the same date.98 To augment these fulltime forces, part-time women’s reserve units were also established.99
The WRAF was to be assimilated as closely as possible with the RAF; the
WRAC – notwithstanding some discussion over the practicability of
incorporating women into the existing male military corps – was to
form a distinct corps within the army; and the WRNS was to continue as
a separate organisation within the naval service.100 The WRAF was to
offer eighteen categories of work (including such roles as cook, waitress,
shorthand typist, engine mechanic, airframe ﬁtter and ﬁghter plotter),
the WRNS twenty-four (including steward, hairdresser, sick berth
attendant, air mechanic, bomb range assessor and meteorologist) and
the WRAC thirty-four (including mess orderly, tailoress, switchboard
operator, storewoman, armament artiﬁcer and anti-aircraft ﬁre control
operator).101 Female recruits (who could be single or married) were to
be entitled to a pension after twenty-two years of regular service.102 The
creation of these new enterprises, which afforded women the opportunity to forge a career with the British armed forces in a way that had not
existed before, marked a signiﬁcant advancement for women in the
public sphere. Peake sensed the historical import. ‘Women after this
war should not “slip-back” as they did after the 1914–18 War’, she
wrote to her mother about plans for a regular women’s air force. ‘This
may well be the beginning of great things and great changes, particularly
as regards equality of opportunity.’103 By 1952 the WRNS was some
5,000 strong, the WRAC 6,000 and the WRAF 10,000.104

Yet although these undertakings might have opened up new
career opportunities for women, in a number of respects they remained
on a different footing to their male equivalents. The women’s services
were, for example, to be solely composed of volunteers and exempt
from peacetime military conscription.105 The latter, it was argued, was
unnecessary since there would be ‘no difﬁculty’ in securing the numbers
required through voluntary recruitment.106 Additionally, in all matters
‘distinctively concerning their well-being as women’, female personnel
were to be administered by those of their own gender and they were
entitled to a discharge on marriage if they so desired.107 Furthermore,
these forces were to continue to be non-combatant in nature.108 Indeed,
the mixed anti-aircraft batteries, whose female ‘gunners’ had perhaps
come closest to challenging the combat taboo during the war, disappeared altogether from the army’s order of battle when the anti-aircraft
command structure in the UK was abolished in 1955.109 Moreover,
servicewomen were to be paid three-quarters of their male equivalents,
an agreement reached after a dispute between the service departments
and the Treasury over the level of pay – the service ministers holding out
for four-ﬁfths of the corresponding male rates, but the chancellor insisting on a lower ﬁgure on the grounds, among others, that women were
exempted from combat.110 On top of this, while the WRAC and WRAF
were to be subject to the disciplinary codes of the Army and Air Force
Acts (including military detention), ‘ﬁeld punishment’ (which involved
heavy labour and physical restraint) was to be prohibited for female
personnel as it was deemed ‘not appropriate to women members of the
Forces’.111 As for the WRNS, it was again to be excluded altogether
from the Naval Discipline Act. Although this was still a bone of contention for some Wrens – a grievance said to be compounded by constant references to them in the press and elsewhere as ‘mere civilians’
because they were not subject to naval law112 – the naval authorities
would not budge. The view was held that the peacetime WRNS would
not be as closely assimilated with the Royal Navy as the other women’s
forces with their male ‘parent’ service and that the Naval Discipline Act
was chieﬂy designed for service aﬂoat and would be inappropriate for
women working predominantly in shore-based roles. It was also the
case that civilian status was not deemed to be inconsistent with the
position in other parts of the naval system where civilians ran ancillary
services, such as the supply service. The comparatively small regular
force, it was contended, was likely to be highly selective in its

recruitment and the present arrangements had ‘operated in practice very
satisfactorily’.113 It was to be 1977 before the WRNS was eventually
brought under the Naval Discipline Act.114
What was also deemed important was that peacetime servicewomen retained their femininity. This was exempliﬁed in the design of
their uniforms in the immediate post-war era. For the WRAC’s ‘No. 1
dress’, a War Ofﬁce committee chaired by Mary Tyrwhitt solicited
designs from leading couturiers, such as Norman Hartnell, Charles
Creed, Edward Molyneux and Aage Thaarup and plumped for
a pattern submitted by Hartnell, the royal dressmaker, which incorporated a fashionable bottle-green jacket, cut away at the front in the style
of the Highland regiments, with a four-gored skirt. It was considered the
most suitable choice since it had ‘a feminine line and yet is reminiscent of
Military Uniforms of the early nineteenth century’.115 The new uniform
was unveiled in 1949.116
The development of the WRAF’s ‘No. 1 dress’ was more rancorous. After the brief, unsuccessful trial of a design based on the uniform worn by the WRAF’s Central Band, in 1952 Nancy Salmon, who
had taken over from Peake as DWRAF in the summer of 1950,
approached Victor Stiebel, another prominent couturier who was
based at the Jacqmar fashion house in Mayfair, with a view to creating
a uniform ‘speciﬁcally for the feminine ﬁgure’.117 But his design, which
featured a stylish, shorter air force blue jacket with less square shoulders
and a more accentuated waist, together with a ﬂared skirt, met with
opposition from a number of senior WRAF ofﬁcers. The inspector of the
WRAF, Group Ofﬁcer Anne Stephens, took particular offence. In
a strongly-worded letter to Salmon, in which she complained that she
was ‘dismayed and greatly perturbed’ to ﬁnd plans for a new uniform so
greatly advanced without having been formally consulted, Stephens
protested that she was ‘completely opposed for reason of both morale
and practical value to a departure from the tradition of wearing the
same uniform as the Royal Air Force’. She laid out her objections under
a series of headings:
Need for femininity
I understand that your desire to encourage the women of the
service to both look and be feminine is your biggest reason for
instigating a new design of uniform. I could not be more in
agreement with you regarding the need for femininity in the

1::79

.

231 / Inauguration
service particularly in view of the masculine life and work in
which we are engaged; but are you really dissatisﬁed with the
degree of femininity which prevails to-day? Surely our ideal for
a member of the WRAF is a woman who always maintains her
ladylike qualities coupled with a sense of discipline which prevents her displaying the temperamentalness sometimes associated with our sex. I would claim that apart from the small
and hard core of ‘tough’ women which no change of uniform
will alter we are in the happy position of having a vast majority of
ofﬁcers and airwomen who are both disciplined and ladylike, and
that there is no need for a special crusade to feminise the service
and therefore no need for a specially feminine cut of uniform.
Pride of service
In my experience members of the WRAF are tremendously
proud of belonging to the Royal Air Force. This is certainly
the biggest morale factor in their service lives; the loyalty which
members of the WRAF give to the WRAF is but secondary, and
only called forth when vis-a-vis the other women’s services. The
basic loyalty of the WRAF is to the Royal Air Force and great
pride is felt in wearing the same uniform as the Royal Air Force.
I do not think we shall ever succeed in building up a pride in and
loyalty to a WRAF uniform which may appear to some to
symbolise a separate WRAF service. You know better than
I the need for pride of service and esprit de corps to support
the service man or woman in the day of trial and danger and in
giving the WRAF a uniform different from the RAF I think we
should strike a grave blow at the morale of the service. For these
reasons I am strongly opposed to a departure from the traditional RAF design. I am prepared to say that 90% of the ofﬁcers
and airwomen of the service would resent being put into
a uniform which differed from the RAF and I would further
say that the 10% (or even 20%) who welcomed a new design
would be made up of those who cared least for the traditions of
the Royal Air Force and had least knowledge of the service.
Integration
The policy of integration has been and is being successfully
pursued, but as you are well aware there is still a degree of
prejudice to the full employment of WRAF personnel in male

1::79

.

80

3 91/.

3 /

232 / Demobilisation and the Permanent Women’s Services
posts. This prejudice is more marked amongst the lower ranking
RAF ofﬁcers at station level and it is here that the WRAF uniform is seen daily. I feel that to put members of the WRAF into
a uniform of their own will encourage those RAF ofﬁcers who
are opposed to integration in their belief that the woman is not
a proper substitute for the man. It will, as it were, give visual
expression to their feeling that ‘the WRAF are different’.
Dating
I have already expressed verbally my fears regarding the effect
of changes in women’s fashions on a speciﬁcally WRAF uniform
design. The model which I saw last week with its short jacket
and slightly ﬂared skirt is essentially a 1952 fashion; I wonder if
women may not be wearing Edwardian cut coats and mutton
chop sleeves in 1962, which will make our 1952 model look
very démodé.
I feel that adherence to the RAF pattern would by the fact
that it is a well known and universally accepted uniform exempt
us from comparison with feminine fashions current at any time.
Publicity
I believe that you are hoping that a new pattern uniform would
have good publicity value and enhance recruiting. I think that
this would in fact be true for the ﬁrst few weeks or months after
its introduction but fear that the initial impetus would soon be
lost. Should the pattern date it would, of course, become
a deterrent to recruiting.
At present in the eyes of the public every ofﬁcer and
airwoman is patently a member of the Royal Air Force; it
is possible that, dressed in a uniform which differed from
the Royal Air Force, members of the WRAF might be mistaken for Air Hostesses or Air Rangers [a branch of the Girl
Guides Association] or members of the WJAC [Women’s
Junior Air Corps]. Should such mistakes be made the publicity value of the new design would be lost and the sense of
insult a grievance amongst members of the WRAF would be
very bitter.118
The Air Council was asked to adjudicate on the matter and, despite
Stephens’s lengthy objections, gave its consent to Stiebel’s design. Not

only was its potential recruitment value alluded to – Hartnell’s creation
was said to have acted as an excellent recruiting agent for the WRAC –
but also a survey of members of the WRAF who had seen it modelled at
RAF Hawkinge (a WRAF training centre) had revealed a clear margin in
its favour over the present design. While opinion had been evenly
divided among ofﬁcers, it had ‘been acclaimed by the majority of the
airwomen’.119 The new uniform was launched in 1954.120

As for the WRNS, an evening mess dress for its ofﬁcers was
adopted. On hearing of proposals for this new item of uniform, a group
of WRNS ofﬁcers in Portsmouth Command took the liberty of producing their own design which was forwarded to the Admiralty for scrutiny. It was described as ‘essentially feminine, whilst remaining
unmistakably uniform’, ‘becoming to all ﬁgures’ and successful in
avoiding ‘the pitfall, so dear to the caricaturist, of arraying young ladies
in quasi-military attire’.121 But various shortcomings were identiﬁed in
this pattern by the new DWRNS, Mary Lloyd, and in 1950 Stiebel was
called upon to design the mess dress.122 He was, however, to be left in
little doubt as to the brief. Instructions were given that the views of ViceAdmiral Lord Mountbatten, at this time the Fourth Sea Lord (who was
responsible for supplying the Royal Navy), should be brought to the
couturier’s attention: ‘I shall not approve of any masculinity in the
evening’, insisted Mountbatten, ‘and am glad to ﬁnd the Queen
[Commandant-in-Chief of the WRNS] shares my views.’123 The resulting creation, an elegant combination of long, ﬂowing skirt and bolero
jacket of black ottoman rayon, complemented by a white marcella
blouse with revered collar, was revealed in 1951.124 It exuded naval
femininity.125

CONCLUSION
The wartime women’s auxiliary services were born out of necessity rather than desire. In this regard, the manpower requirements of the
armed forces were clearly of central importance in accounting for their
revival in the late 1930s. After the experience of the First World War, it
never seemed in doubt that in another major conﬂict the service departments would need to employ women in auxiliary roles in order to free up
their male personnel for combatant duties. As the threat of war loomed,
especially in the wake of the Munich crisis, the armed forces were
compelled to make contingency plans in peacetime to ensure that they
would have a trained pool of womanpower available to them on the
outbreak of hostilities. The War Ofﬁce and the Air Ministry were in the
vanguard over this, but even the Admiralty, which was less enthusiastic,
came to recognise the requirement for such measures.
But what was also important, and what can be contrasted with
the focus on the anti-militarist activities of women in the inter-war
years,1 was the part women themselves played in pressurising the
armed forces to readmit them into their sphere. In this respect the
‘enthusiastic ladies’ of the women’s bodies, as the Air Member for
Personnel termed them, played a key role both in persuading the service
authorities of the military utility of women auxiliaries and in keeping
the issue on the ‘rearmament’ agenda.2 Indeed, Constance Woodhead,
who authored the Air Ministry’s internal history of the WAAF, argued
that ‘it was the enthusiasm of the various women’s organisations which
before 1939 overcame governmental and departmental resistance and
ﬁnally brought the women’s services into existence’.3 At the forefront of

this effort were Lady Londonderry and Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (with
Katharine Furse playing a similar role in relation to the Royal Navy).
Before the First World War, both these ﬁgures had been active suffragists who had campaigned for the political rights of women.4 Now, as
a new war approached, they used their formidable lobbying skills to
press for women’s military rights. Yet this was to be a battle fought from
the sofa rather than the soap box. As Mollie Izzard noted: ‘they attacked
on a broad front at the luncheon and dinner table, and harassed by
means of the telephone’.5 What sealed the matter were the hordes of
patriotic women who clamoured to undertake national service at the
time of Munich and thereafter, forcing the service authorities to act.
Felicity Peake of the WAAF typiﬁed their attitude: ‘Like so many
others’, she stated, ‘I merely wanted to serve my country.’ It would
not be long before she was doing her duty on the ‘frontline’ at Biggin
Hill during the Battle of Britain.6
In many respects the wartime women’s auxiliary services represented a considerable gender advance for women. From a position
shortly before the war in which there were no such ofﬁcial women’s
forces, by the end of the conﬂict over 400,000 women were serving with
the ATS, WAAF and WRNS at home and overseas. Servicewomen now
undertook a range of military duties, including manning the ﬁre-control
instruments on anti-aircraft guns, that few could have anticipated ﬁve
years earlier. Furthermore, rather than being ‘camp followers’, these
women (with the exception of the WRNS) were endowed with a military
status that designated them members of the armed forces of the crown
and entitled their ofﬁcers to hold the king’s commission. In certain
circumstances, female ofﬁcers were permitted to issue orders to servicemen. Although this journey was fraught with difﬁculties as gender
identities were renegotiated, servicewomen came to play such an integral role in the wartime armed forces that the military authorities found
it necessary to establish permanent regular post-war women’s services
and, in so doing, opened up a military career for women for the ﬁrst
time. Some justly regard these women as feminist pioneers. ‘The woman
who, today, goes to sea in a warship or ﬂies a jet aircraft’, writes Colin
Dobinson, ‘is heir to the tradition begun by Pile’s “gunner girls”.’7
The women’s forces performed an important military function
for their wartime ‘parent’ services. At their peak numbers, the ATS
made up 7% of the total combined strength of the ATS and the army,
the WRNS 9% of the combined strength of the WRNS and the Royal

2 8:

237 / Conclusion
Navy and the WAAF 16% of the combined strength of the WAAF and
the RAF.8 In the United Kingdom, the WAAF made up 22% of the
combined strength.9 Overall, this represented a signiﬁcant female
labour force for the armed services. It was calculated, for example,
that without the WAAF the RAF would have required an additional
150,000 men who could only have been provided at the expense of the
other services or war production.10 Likewise, the ATS ‘gunners’ in the
mixed batteries in AA Command were alone estimated to have saved the
army 28,000 men.11 This was the equivalent of roughly thirty-ﬁve
infantry battalions – or the riﬂe strength of four frontline infantry
divisions.12 By the same token, some of the non-combatant branches
of the armed forces became very reliant on female personnel. It was
reported in 1945, for instance, that in the British army at home servicewomen made up 50% of those undertaking pay, records and signals
duties; in the RAF, they accounted for 50% of those employed as clerks
and 86% as teleprinter operators; and in the Royal Navy, they constituted 88% of the clerical and 97% of the telephone branches.13 In fact,
during Operation Overlord much of the Royal Navy’s vital shore-based
communications was in the hands of Wrens.14 At the commander-inchief’s signals distribution ofﬁce in Portsmouth, such was the burden of
responsibility that some of the women had ‘tears of fatigue running
down their faces’.15 It was a powerful indication of the importance of
the women’s services to the functioning of the armed forces that when in
the summer of 1945 Churchill called for servicewomen to be demobilised as and when they wished, regardless of their release category – ‘the
sooner they are back at their homes the better’16 – this was ﬁrmly
opposed by the manpower authorities. Their view was that if women
were allowed to leave on such a basis this would ‘seriously impair the
efﬁciency of the Services, and in some branches even lead to a complete
breakdown’.17
As for the servicewomen themselves, although distinctions of
social class, age, race and ethnicity, sexuality, rank, military occupation,
type of auxiliary service and status as conscript or volunteer, intersected
with those of gender,18 most seem to have regarded their experiences in
the forces with a good deal of satisfaction. Admittedly, as Dorothy
Sheridan reminds us, some reﬂected on their period in uniform as merely
a temporary interruption to their peacetime lives: ‘we wanted to get
back home and pick up the threads of normal life once again’, recalled
a former member of the ATS.19 Others, by their own admission, were

238 / Conclusion
just not cut out for service life and never ﬁtted in. ‘I look back on those
years’, confessed one ex-Wren, ‘as the most miserable I have ever
spent.’20 Yet the majority who have placed their experiences on record
appear to have enjoyed and beneﬁtted from their time in the forces.
There were strong bonds of friendship forged. Waaf Mary Hickes
recounted that ‘The camaraderie was excellent – we were all in the
same boat and helped one another; many missed that part of service
life more than anything else on demobilisation.’21 There was
a broadening of outlook. ‘I think the whole thing was very very salutary,’ ruminated Wren Ann Tomlinson. ‘I think I learned how to like
and respect other people who were not of backgrounds like mine, who
had very different experiences.’22 There was a sense of empowerment.
Waaf Jean Wright reminisced that ‘for us it was the chance of a lifetime,
expressing ourselves, doing jobs and experiencing a way of life we had
never had a chance to experience before, and all within the protective
framework of the services’.23 There were feelings of pride. ‘Pride – yes,’
stressed Vee Robinson of the ATS, ‘for with thousands of other girls
I had helped defend this land of ours against an enemy who threatened
us with slavery. That may sound melodramatic; nevertheless it was
true.’24 And there was mischief and laughter to be had. ‘There was so
much natural fun . . .’, remembered Waaf Rebecca Barnett. ‘In a way we
behaved at times like a slightly older version of the St Trinians’ girls.’25
Female veterans were, moreover, linked together by an invisible chain.
Winifred Lane of the ATS commented that ‘For some years after the
war, whenever I met women for the ﬁrst time, I knew if they had been in
any of the women’s Forces. Common experience bred a kindness,
a greater understanding and sympathy between women, unknown
before or since.’26 Penny Summerﬁeld has written of former servicewomen looking back on their wartime lives and reconstructing their
time in the forces around such transformative concepts as becoming
‘better and more complete people’, understanding their ‘spiritual and
corporeal humanity with others’, gaining ‘a sense of identiﬁcation with
the nation’ and acquiring ‘a new gender identity’.27
Yet the more afﬁrmative aspects of service life could be tempered by moments of great pathos. In one of the German ‘tip and run’
raids on British coastal towns in May 1943, twenty-six members of the
ATS serving in 103 AA Brigade were killed. Twelve Focke-Wulf ﬁghterbombers attacking Great Yarmouth destroyed their hostel at Sefton
House, close to the seafront, just after they had returned from early

morning PT. Six of the ATS dead were laid to rest in nearby Caister Old
Cemetery, including nineteen-year-old Private Lilian Grimmer, a local
recruit who had reputedly swopped her leave with a friend who was
eager to celebrate her twenty-ﬁrst birthday.28 A marble memorial tablet
now commemorates the fallen at the site of the former hostel.29 There
were also tragic accidents. In November 1943 two WAAF ofﬁcers,
Section Ofﬁcers Ruth Watson and Monica Daventry, were fatally
injured when, being driven back to their quarters late one night after
duty with the RAF delegation in Washington DC, their vehicle collided
with another at the junction of Albermarle Street and Nebraska Avenue
Northwest. The two Waafs were buried in Arlington National Cemetery
with military honours, their cofﬁns borne on horse-drawn caissons and
draped in Union Jacks with a detail of American soldiers acting as
pallbearers. They were the ﬁrst foreign servicewomen to be interred at
the US national shrine.30
The deaths of servicewomen could leave an indelible mark on
those who witnessed such events. WAAF ofﬁcer, Muriel Gane Pushman,
was deeply traumatised when several of her barrage balloon operators
were killed during a bombing raid on Cardiff in 1943:
In the early hours of the next morning, we were awakened by
the heart-stopping wail of the air raid sirens. Immediately we
scrambled out of bed, grabbed our clothes, ran to our bicycles,
and raced down the long Castle drive to spread out like a fan,
each of us going to a different balloon site . . . .
As I pedalled frantically, I had to admit to myself that I was
terriﬁed. The noise of the guns blazing away in the dark was
deafening, and I felt, rather irrationally, that I was alone in a city
on the brink of destruction. With the exception of the odd
policeman or air raid warden, I saw no one about, until my
bicycle was joined on the main road by ﬁre engines and ambulances, coming and going in all directions. Dear God, I prayed,
please don’t let me be killed tonight. A line from some halfforgotten poem ﬁltered into my mind – ‘nor let me die before
I have begun to live.’ I think I was crying, but being so alone,
consoled myself with the knowledge that no one else would ever
know.
I arrived at the balloon site. All was calm. While the world
exploded around them, these incredible girls were quietly

tending their balloons. I sent a silent thank-you towards the
heavens for our safety to this point, followed by another ﬂurry
of prayers to keep it that way . . . .
The violence of the raid increased, and ﬁnally we had to dash
into the little aid raid shelter on the site and sit it out in the dark.
The only comfort was the proximity of others. We were packed
in and felt the closeness, emotionally as well as physically. None
of us spoke, listening instead to the terrible, persistent bombing
in the world outside our temporary cocoon of safety.
It was not until daybreak that the full horror became known.
One of our balloon sites up on a hill on the far side of the city had
received a direct hit, blowing the Nissen hut to smithereens and
instantly killing several of the girls. The pretty little corporal in
charge had her arm and shoulder blown off and suffered dreadful
damage to one side of her face. In this appalling condition, she
had managed to crawl to the Pioneer Corps position – nearly
a quarter of a mile away – to raise the alarm. She had only been
married the previous week, and her husband, an able seaman in
the Navy, had just left for sea duty, destination unknown.
The ruin of these young lives, and the feeling of sick helplessness at the carnage of that night, marked a watershed in my
life. Painful as my wartime losses had been, I had not been there
at the ending of lives dear to me. I had been able to protect
myself by giving dignity and purpose to their deaths, mentally
burying the realities in ﬂag-draped cofﬁns. Now, as I stood with
the other ofﬁcers while parts of bodies were collected, I found
myself shivering despite the warm sunshine. No one spoke and
no one cried. The hurt was too deep, and our eyes too dry for
tears. How could all this youth and freshness, this joy and
promise, have ended in these torn, sad remnants? . . .
The next week was a blur. Nothing seemed quite real. We
were called upon to accompany the bodies to their respective
home towns and attend the funerals alongside the families. I was
emotionally keyed up with pity, concern, and nerves, but what
does remain in my mind after all these years was the pride and
unaffected dignity with which these ordinary and unheroic people buried their children . . . . There were no parents to whom
I spoke during that agonizing week who did not truly believe that
the daughters they loved had died with honour in a just cause.31

241 / Conclusion
Whilst the wartime women’s auxiliary services might have represented
a considerable gender advance for women, they did not, however,
achieve equality with their ‘parent’ services. The ATS, WAAF and
WRNS remained essentially auxiliary forces and across a wide spectrum
of military life servicewomen were treated differently to their male
counterparts. Despite nuances between the services, they continued,
for example, to be predominantly utilised in ‘feminine’ jobs; they
retained their own corps of ‘administrative’ ofﬁcers who looked after
the women’s ‘well being’; they did not receive equal pay; they were not
subject to the same disciplinary sanctions (and in the case of the WRNS
were not subject to the Naval Discipline Act at all); they faced restrictions on their overseas service; they received priority for release at the
end of the war if they were married; and they were generally held to
higher standards of off-duty behaviour. Above all, and in spite of some
ambiguities, they were not to be used in direct combat roles. The
voracious demands of ‘total war’ were thus undercut by the need to
maintain gender conventions. Furthermore, the service departments’
assessments of female performance were highly gendered. Whilst they
were regarded as being more proﬁcient than their male counterparts at
routine sedentary jobs that required ‘manual dexterity, neatness or
accuracy’ – skills, it might be added, that the RAF’s Director of
Technical Training was reported to have attributed to ‘generations of
patient delicate-ﬁngered females who had devoted long hours to crossstitch, petit-point or invisible mending’32 – they were considered less
accomplished in tasks that called for ‘initiative, responsibility and
drive’, inclined ‘to get ﬂustered in emergency and more easily discouraged when up against difﬁculties’. In fact, their presence on occasion
was justiﬁed on the grounds of maintaining male morale. Margaret and
Patrice Higonnet have used the metaphor of a double helix to delineate
a model of wartime gender relations in which women might have
challenged conventional gender boundaries, but the underlying structures of female subordination remained the same. ‘In this social dance,’
they contend, ‘the woman appears to have taken a step forward as the
partners change places – but in fact he is still leading her’.33
In explaining why the women’s forces did not achieve greater
wartime equality, the intractability of the male service establishment
undoubtedly played a role. As the ATS hierarchy delicately put it, ‘many
cherished traditions and ideals, both of women as such and their place in
a hitherto purely masculine organisation, had to be overcome’.34 There

was also public resistance to the creation of a female warrior corps.
‘Boadicea was, in some ways, a noble character’, remarked one male
MP, ‘but she has never been held up as the ideal of British womanhood.
We do not want to see the ideal of British womanhood brought down to
the pagan level of the Amazons or even to the level of Boadicea.’35 But it
was further due in part to the attitude of senior servicewomen and their
perception of gender differences within the armed forces.36 In the
WRNS, Vera Laughton Mathews strongly believed that ‘a woman’s
Service must be largely run by women’ and its distinctive way of administering things ‘was better for women than if it had been exactly on naval
lines’.37 In the ATS, Leslie Whateley contended that as a result of ‘the
peculiar psychology of women’ it was ‘utterly impossible . . . to try to
run a women’s service on identical lines with those of a male
organization’.38 As for the WAAF, which was more closely assimilated
in organisational terms with its ‘parent’ service than the other women’s
services, similar views were aired within Jane Trefusis-Forbes’s
directorate:
It has been generally agreed that a service of women cannot in
every way be run on similar lines as a force of men. The average
woman, apart from her physique, it not likely naturally to adapt
herself to Service conditions, unless handled sensitively and
carefully.39
In a revealing interview with the American journalist and author
Margaret Goldsmith, Jean Knox, head of the ATS from 1941 to
1943, almost seemed to decry the wartime gender advances of
servicewomen:
‘To build up an effective women’s service like the ATS,’ she said,
‘one must always bear in mind that there are great psychological
differences between men and women, and to get the best contribution for the country out of the women, this fact must be
born in mind so that their special feminine talents and abilities
can be used most effectively. The valuable contribution of
women should be kept separate from that of men. They should
not really walk side by side, for then women would inevitably
get ahead, and this would have a disruptive effect on society. In
an ideal world,’ Mrs Knox added, ‘women should be able to
look up to men.’40

243 / Conclusion
ATS staff ofﬁcer Mary Thomson recalled that establishing a close working relationship with her male counterparts in AA Command was
frowned upon by some in her service as somehow suspicious and as
exploiting her feminine wiles: ‘You weren’t supposed to be helped by the
men. If you said the men were helpful then immediately they thought,
ah, ah, what’s going on’. She felt she was walking ‘a tightrope’ and that
‘she gets on with the men’ was sometimes used as ‘a derogatory
remark’.41
Meanwhile, women in the forces appeared determined to retain
their femininity whilst in uniform. It was reported that when ATS
‘gunners’ assumed operational duties in anti-aircraft batteries there
was an increased interest in ‘feminine matters of dress and
appearance’.42 In similar terms, PT sessions in the WAAF were said to
have only been made tolerable to airwomen at RAF stations when
presented, against the regulations, as ‘health and beauty’ classes.43
Alongside this, reassuring messages were conveyed to the public to
counter fears about the defeminising effects of military life. In a War
Ofﬁce-approved lecture to a conference on maternity and child welfare
in 1942, the recently retired chief woman medical adviser to the ATS,
Dr Letitia Fairﬁeld, sought to allay such anxieties:
It is sometime suggested that by working in close association
with men on jobs usually reserved for men, and in men’s clothes,
women may be ‘psychologically damaged’ and ﬁnd themselves
turning into men. In my experience, for what it is worth, there is
no cause for worry. Service women do not even get these ideas
unless someone else puts them into their heads. They value their
own homes all the more because they have had to leave them,
and the more they work on men’s jobs the more charmingly
feminine do they become.44
Princess Elizabeth reinforced this message. At an ATS reunion in 1949
at the Royal Albert Hall, she observed that ‘the rough, no less than the
smooth, gave us a chance to develop qualities which should make us
better wives, mothers, and citizens’.45
What was more, in the view of Wren Angela Mack, the majority
of servicewomen did not see their military service as primarily a chance
to break down doors marked ‘men only’. ‘There were certainly a few,
but only a few, who enjoyed the idea of being male impersonators’, she
remarked. ‘These pseudo macho characters sported Eton-cropped hair

and enjoyed giving out crisp orders and relished prancing about on the
parade ground.’ Nonetheless, she argued that
Looking back, I’m sure that most of us newcomers hoping to
become members of the Women’s Royal Naval Service were
clear about one thing and that was that we were feminine
creatures putting our normal lives on one side to help with the
war effort. I don’t remember that we thought much about ‘freedom of opportunity’ or the chance at last to show men what
stuff we were made of.46
But the strongly masculine workplace culture within the armed forces
could be inimical to servicewomen. The high proportion of men to
women serving in these forces, combined with a working environment
in which they worked and lived closely together in challenging and
conﬁned circumstances and a rank structure that could lead to abuses
of power, were fertile grounds for sexual harassment by servicemen –
a number of whom regarded their female counterparts as little more
than ‘slap-and-tickle girls’ or ‘comforts for the troops’.47 Some women
never seem to have encountered such behaviour. ‘I think it is forgotten
today’, insisted WAAF clerk Dorothea Gray, ‘how respectful men were
with women during the war. There was never, although I worked in an
ofﬁce with seven or eight men, any of the sly nudging, the innuendos, the
blue jokes or even the swearing one might have expected.’48 Similarly,
ATS driver Joan Stewart reminisced of her posting to a REME unit, in
which ﬁve auxiliaries worked alongside a platoon of soldiers, that ‘The
men were lovely! They treated us like sisters. It was like belonging to
a big family.’49 Others, however, as we have seen, did experience sexual
harassment and Alice Kessler-Harris has argued that such coercive
behaviour in the workplace has ‘long sustained male prerogative and
unequal power relationships’ and been ‘a prime driver of persistent
gender inequalities’.50
Some servicewomen looked back on their wartime lives and
regarded the sexual harassment they encountered as little more than
harmless fun. ‘We took it all in good part’, recollected Morfydd Brooks
of the sexual ‘banter’ directed at her from RAF aircrew, ‘because we
knew the great strains they were under and the dangers they would soon
face.’51 But this was not the case for others. ATS cook, Constance
Poolman, admitted that she was so distressed by the soldiers’ wolf
whistles and cat calls that she often had to hide away after doling out

2 8:

their tea in order to compose herself: ‘I was so nervous I was
trembling.’52 On occasion, they suffered sickening physical injuries.
One Waaf revealed that she and her fellow airwomen could not visit
their latrines after dark for fear of being raped by soldiers from a nearby
transit camp and that ‘several girls had scars and black eyes’ after
violent assaults. Thereafter armed airmen were assigned to guard
them with orders to shoot any intruder found on their site at night.53
At the end of the war, many of the gender complexities and
ambiguities that characterised the wartime women’s auxiliary services
were still at play in the decision to create the permanent regular postwar women’s forces. Again, the Admiralty was less eager to follow this
path but eventually came into line with the War Ofﬁce and the Air
Ministry. On the face of it, this historic development could be interpreted as a feminist victory for servicewomen that rewarded them for
their contribution to the British military war effort by opening up a new
career for female personnel in the armed forces. But whilst the role of
women was acknowledged by the service departments, and there was
some recognition that they might well now expect to take their place
alongside the peacetime regulars and be disappointed if excluded, the
creation of these standing women’s services was not the result of a great
surge of feminism through the corridors of Whitehall. It was more the
consequence of hard-headed calculations about the manpower requirements of the post-war armed forces and the need to create small regular
women’s cadres that were capable of expansion in times of future war –
partly, it should be noted, in order to try and prevent a repetition of the
male prejudices that had characterised male-female service relations in
the early years of the 1939–45 conﬂict. Lucy Noakes has observed that
the motto of the WRAC, ‘suaviter in modo, fortiter in re’ (‘gentle in
manner, resolute in deed’), which fused the military attributes of
strength and tenacity with the womanly virtues of tenderness and compassion, symbolised the gender tensions within the post-war services.
‘Although the work of women in the military had ﬁnally been recognised and rewarded by the creation of a permanent space for them
within the British armed forces,’ she argues, ‘this space was one which
was entirely deﬁned by their gender.’54
Perceptions of bravery could also be gendered. On 30 June 1942
Audrey Roche (then Audrey Coningham), a twenty-three-year-old
WRNS ofﬁcer from Sussex, was aboard the submarine depot ship
HMS Medway II, having been evacuated from Alexandria as the

Germans advanced into Egypt. Her ship, however, was sunk en route to
Haifa by a German U-boat in the Mediterranean, with the loss of thirty
of those on board and Roche was forced into the sea. Whilst swimming
to safety, she came across Leading Seaman Leslie Crossman clinging to
another sailor. Crossman was injured, could not swim and with no
lifebelt was in imminent danger of drowning as his head kept disappearing beneath the waves. Even though she did not know how long she
would be in the water, she unthinkingly gave the man her lifebelt and
told him ‘Lie still. You’ll be all right. Trust me’. Her selﬂess act enabled
Crossman to stay aﬂoat until rescued by a boat while she eventually
managed to reach another ship and was hauled aboard. The captain of
the Medway reported that she had ‘undoubtedly saved this man’s life’.
For her gallantry, Roche was recommended for the immediate award of
the Albert Medal (which has since been superseded by the George Cross)

and this nomination received the backing of the Commander-in-Chief of
the Mediterranean ﬂeet, Admiral Sir Henry Harwood, who had won
fame at the Battle of the River Plate. However, the honours and awards
committee in London decided that since a nearby male ofﬁcer in the
water had helped Roche to put the lifebelt on Crossman, and she was
a strong swimmer, she had not put herself in undue danger and thus
should be merely mentioned in despatches. It was suggested that some
publicity should be given to her action ‘which will bring credit to the
WRNS’, but that this ‘would not redound nearly so favourably if there
were any suggestion that Miss Coningham was granted a decoration
which might be regarded as easily won’. Despite the parsimony of the
authorities, Roche wore her Oak Leaf decoration with pride and is
thought to be the only women to have been decorated for bravery at
sea during the war. Yet it was an indication of some of the challenges
that Roche and others like her posed to the male warrior culture that the
reaction of one naval ofﬁcer to seeing her display the decoration was
said to have been ‘outrage’ since he simply ‘could not believe that she
was entitled to it’. On a happier note, it might be recorded that, unlike
Daphne Pearson, Roche was able to meet again the man she saved. At
a reunion in 1987 a grinning Crossman, who had gone on to be decorated himself for gallantry, was reintroduced to his wartime saviour.
Roche, however, did not immediately recognise him. ‘I can’t pretend
I would have picked you out’, she quipped to Crossman. ‘You weren’t
smiling when we last met.’55

than forty-three for the ATS and WAAF) but all the women’s services were
prepared to accept women up to and including the age of forty-nine if they had
exceptional qualiﬁcations or experience. For a period in 1941 some volunteers for
the ATS were able to enrol for UK service only. From the autumn of 1943, the
WRNS ‘immobile’ branch was no longer open to new volunteers.

exclude women locally enlisted abroad. Precise volunteering ﬁgures for
September 1939 to December 1940 do not seem to be available for the WRNS
and those for the ATS and WAAF seem variable in their accuracy, so the totals
should be regarded as approximations.

45. Quoted in V. Nicholson, Millions like us: women’s lives in war and peace
1939–1949 (London: Viking, 2011), p. 146. Contemporary observers such as
Edith Summerskill contended that such attitudes were part of a longer-term suspicion of women in public roles that ‘struck a mid-Victorian note’: ‘There is a certain
type of individual who is always ready to suspect the morals of women who indulge
in activities outside the home and who is obsessed with the idea that a girl in
uniform attracts certain undesirable characters’. See E. Summerskill, ‘Conscription
and women’, The Fortnightly, vol. 151 (March 1942), p. 209. Also see
P. Summerﬁeld, ‘Women and war in the twentieth century’ in J. Purvis (ed.),
Women’s history: Britain 1850–1945: an introduction (London: Routledge,
2000), p. 329. This opprobrium was not aimed exclusively at the ATS. Jean
Wallace of the WAAF wrote of ‘self-righteous middle class ladies’ who ‘thought
of us girls in uniforms and away from home as promiscuous sluts’ and who ‘made
damned sure that their daughters were in reserved occupations and who could thus
stay at home’. See IWM, papers of J. Wallace, Documents.1161, ‘Recollections of
a servicewoman in the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force during the Second World
War’, undated, pp. 15–16. When, early in the war, the Daily Mail invited its readers

should be noted that women between the ages of eighteen and ﬁfty could theoretically be called-up under the act, but it was indicated in the parliamentary debate
that only those between twenty and thirty would be summoned (although it was
subsequently announced in 1943 that the call-up age for women would be reduced
to nineteen). The liability to serve did not extend to women in Northern Ireland (see
J. W. Blake, Northern Ireland in the Second World War (Belfast: Blackstaff Press,
2000), pp. 197–9). Some 900 women were successful in obtaining ofﬁcial status as
conscientious objectors (see H. Nicholson, ‘A disputed identity: women conscientious objectors in Second World War Britain’, Twentieth Century British History,
vol. 18, no. 4 (2007), p. 416).

pp. 39, 46–8. Henry Harris, a psychologist closely involved in wartime ofﬁcer
selection techniques, surmised that one of the ‘temptations’ that the ‘all-women’
WOSBs might succumb to, was ‘a difﬁculty – that should be obvious enough – in
being objective about candidates who happen to be attractive to men’. Presumably,
‘attractiveness’ to men might have been regarded as a negative attribute by a WOSB,
but this statement can be read both ways. See Harris, The group approach to

comparable. The number of categories also varies between sources, so it is difﬁcult
to establish agreed totals. See, for example, K. L. Sherit, ‘The integration of women

work categorisations or trade groups and numbers ﬂuctuated over time.
However, in January 1944 the WRNS ‘domestic, clerical, and communications’
categories accounted for 68% of its total service personnel; in September 1944
the WAAF ‘admin, domestic, and ground signals’ categories accounted for 70%
of its total service personnel; and in January 1945 the ATS ‘catering, communications, domestic, and clerical’ categories accounted for 70% of its total service
personnel.

of highly secret work, members of the ATS were employed as laboratory assistants,
and in the associated rat houses, producing scrub typhus vaccine for troops in
south-east Asia. See Whateley, ‘The work of the Auxiliary Territorial Service in the

1945; and ‘Comparative quality of the work of RN and WRNS personnel’, by
Head of Naval Branch, 14 May 1945. Kathleen Sherit has pointed out that the
evidence to the commission might have been partly intended to highlight gender
differences in order to undermine the case for equal pay. See Sherit, ‘The integration
of women into the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force’, p. 37; and Sherit, Women
on the front line, p. 39.

of the forces who, for various reasons, were not provided with service rations and
had to buy their own meals from catering institutions, had been set at four-ﬁfths of
the corresponding male rates. However, in 1944 this ration allowance was

free condoms were made available by the military authorities to British servicemen
overseas (and occasionally to units at home), no provision seems to have been made
for servicewomen. When rumours began to circulate in the United States that
contraceptives were being distributed to the US Women’s Army Corps (and one
WRNS ofﬁcer, Betty Hodges, claimed that they were issued ‘as a matter of course’
to the American women’s services) such was the ofﬁcial concern that President
Roosevelt was forced to repudiate them. See J. Marshall, ‘Prevention of venereal

awfully fond of an airman; she knows he has gone out night after night, and
the chances are that sooner or later he will not come back, so dash it, you
might as well’. See LSE, Markham 24/22, women’s services welfare and

her fellow Wrens had to be accompanied by a male escort when going out for an
evening and signed out of their quarters. This procedure, she surmised, must have
become garbled in the telling because when an American aircraft carrier arrived in
the harbour, the ship’s company turned up at the camp gates shouting ‘We Wanna
Wren’. It seems that ‘word had gone around that if you wanted a Wren you signed
for one like a parcel and she was presumably supposed to be handed over like
a parcel.’ See IWM, Ackroyd, Documents.660, letter from Joan Russell to Miggs

125. In 1960, a mess dress for WRAC ofﬁcers was unveiled which was arguably more
glamorous. Designed by Owen Hyde-Clark of the House of Worth, it featured ‘a
slim cream and gold lamé Empire gown, with small sleeves, square neck, a ﬁsh-tail
pleat at the ﬂoor-length hem and a long green silk sash fastened to the shoulder by
a single rank-marked epaulette, then falling to the ground and ending in a gold
fringe’. One contemporary newspaper report remarked that it ’casts aside all
semblance of uniform and comes right out on the side of glamour’. See E. Ewing,
Women in uniform through the ages (London: B. T. Batsford, 1975), p. 137; and
‘Evening glamour for WRAC ofﬁcers’, Glasgow Herald, 27 July 1960, p. 5.

that at the age of twenty she had been spat upon in the street by passers-by
whilst selling the Suffragette newspaper. See Douglas, Feminist freikorps, p. 16;
Thomas, ‘Mathews, Dame Elvira’, ODNB; and Mathews, Blue tapestry, pp.
28–9, 45.
5. Izzard, A heroine in her time, p. 271. In the mid-1930s Londonderry had written
admiringly of Hitler but also pressed for the utilisation of women in the armed
forces. It seems likely that, like her husband, she believed that making friends with
Germany and rearmament were, as Ian Kershaw has noted, ‘complementary strands
of the same policy’. See I. Kershaw, Making friends with Hitler: Lord Londonderry
and Britain’s road to war (London: Penguin, 2005), pp. 155, 340; and M. Pugh,

status of women. See, for example, A. Marwick, ‘People’s war and top people’s

Aircraftswoman Lilian Sarah Ellis who was awarded the British Empire Medal for
‘outstanding leadership, coolness and courage’. See ‘Injured WAAF raid heroine’,

similar terms, Dorothy Sheridan has written of ‘challenge and containment’ in the
ATS. See Sheridan, ‘ATS women’, p. 67. More broadly, Sonya Rose contends that
the war ‘opened up new opportunities for women to exercise their obligations as
citizens’ but ‘gender difference continued to be a fundamental principle of wartime
policies’. See Rose, Which people’s war?, p. 122.

gender shapes the war system and vice-versa (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
2001), pp. 38–49. Julie Fountain has also written of ‘conservative feminism’ to denote
women who were motivated by duty and citizenship and did not explicitly pursue
a feminist agenda, but nevertheless sought wider opportunities and recognition within
the existing system. See Fountain, ‘Modern jobs for modern women’, pp. 16, 224.

public that women were not being defeminised in the ATS, but her comments could
be interpreted as a disservice to the contribution of servicewomen to the wartime
armed forces.

group commanders in 1941 that in suspected cases of rape or criminal assault,
medical evidence was to be obtained as soon as possible and that help should be
obtained from the army medical branch and the Judge Advocate General’s ofﬁce.
With the arrival of greater numbers of foreign troops and increasing numbers of
cases, new advice was issued in 1943 which indicated that the civil police should deal
with these offences and instructed the ATS ofﬁcer on the spot to inform the local
police, ascertain if the woman was to be examined by a police surgeon and ensure
that she was made comfortable whilst minimising the damage to the evidence on her
clothes or person. See Crew, The Army Medical Services: administration, vol. 2, pp.
