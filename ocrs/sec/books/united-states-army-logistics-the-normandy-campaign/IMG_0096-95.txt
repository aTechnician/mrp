145th Tank Battalion), letter to author, April 5, 1991.
Many combat troops believed
that supply personnel in the rear intercepted the best meal menus.
Colonel Bobbett
stated that the rear area people kept all the meals containing bacon as soon they learned
the key code numbers.
Lieutenant Spencer stated that roast beef was the favorite menu
but they seldom received any, and were usually issued meals with beans in them.
Whether or not the rear-area personnel were keeping the most popular menu types for
themselves, many at the front believed that they were. This perception only increased
the Gls' motivation to find fresher, more palatable food.
72. This practice has continued to the present day. In response to overwhelming
demand and is practich amost soldiers began carrying bottles of Tabasco sauce into the
field, the new MREs (meals-ready-to-eat) are now issued with a small bottle of Tabasco
sauce included.

78. Robert E. Cheatham, letter to author, April 16, 1991; First United States
Army,
"Provost Marshal Section," annex 15 in First United States Army Report Of
Operations, 23 October 1943-1 August 1944 (N.p., n.d.), 24.
Other military police
apparently showed a similar lack of zeal in pursuing such cases.
From June 6 to
August 1 the provost marshal handled only ten cases related to slaughtering cattle and
two cases for stealing produce.
The potential for a greater slaughter of French
livestock surely increased in the fall of 1944, when the military police were taxed to
the limit, policing the Red Ball Express, directing troop movements, and guarding the
ever-lengthening supply lines.
It is unlikely that the number of cases brought forward
by the provost marshal would have increased greatly from the earlier period, MPs had
more important things to do than harass units for eating French livestock.
