Landing Craft and Wool
Drawers: The Logistical Plans
While ETOUSA and SOS jockeyed for jurisdiction over various logistical
matters, planning for Operation OVERLORD reached its peak. Historians have
described the American logistical effort in many ways. All of these descriptions
have one thing in common:
they highlight the
"intensive planning
and
preparation" for D-Day.' According to James Huston, "Logistics was a constant
and overriding factor in the
conception, planning, and execution of the
Normandy invasion"?
Russell Weigley described the operation as the "most
meticulously planned endeavor in all military history. "3 Supply planners studied
everything from the number of landing craft required to the quantity of wool
drawers needed to sustain operations on the Continent.
No shortage of plans
plagued the Americans,
just a lack of flexibility.
The SHAEF G-4, Major
General Robert Crawford, summarized the problem best.
He "surmised that the
operation could be supported if everything went according to plan, for there was
no margin of safety. "4
General
Crawford knew, of course,
that combat
operations never entirely "went according to plan."
safety"
Having
"no margin of
made an operation the size of Operation
OVERLORD even more
daunting.
Logisticians faced two major obstacles to successful planning.
First. the
supply personnel had to provide sufficient materiel to meet the immediate
logistical needs of the invasion forces.
The vast majority of time spent on
planning went to ensure that the Germans did not push the invading Allies back
into the sea as a result of a lack of supplies.
Second, the American forces had
to acquire sufficient discharge facilities in France to meet their long-term supply
requirements.
A great deal of long-term planning dealt with this issue.
Much
of the work later proved unusable as developments in Normandy led to changes
in the plans.
The success or failure of the invasion depended upon the ability
of the logisticians to deal with these two issues.
The Operation NEPTUNE initial joint plan (IJP) guided the overall planning
for the Normandy invasion.
