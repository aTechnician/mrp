of rations on hand on the first, 2.1 days on the fifth, .7 days on the eighth, and
0.0 days on the ninth. The lack of rations became so critical that on September
11 and 12, FUSA had to use 75,000 and 52,000 captured rations, respectively?
Luckily, on September 8, when TUSA captured a German meat packing facility
intact with 2,600,000 pounds of frozen beef and 500,000 pounds of canned
meat, its Class I officer took immediate possession of the facility.® U.S. forces
used captured enemy rations as much as possible so that COMZ could devote
space on the Red Ball Express to other items.'
While the ammunition supply proved adequate in August, ADSEC diverted
a large part of its truck force to haul artillery shells early in the month to meet
increased
expenditures.
While
halting
the
German
Vire-Mortain
counteroffensive and assaulting the Brittany ports of St. Malo and Brest required
a large quantity of shells, by mid-August the heavy fighting had ended for the
bulk of the army and ammunition expenditures decreased.
The First Division
G-4 noted in his August report that ordnance expenditures had not been
excessive and that the division's 200 ton reserve on attached trucks had been
dropped. l° The division needed the vehicles to haul gasoline.
Meanwhile the
ammunition shortage continued to hinder the efforts of the VIII Corps to clear
the Brittany Peninsula."
increased
When the American forces reached the German West wall in September, the
resistance combined with the difficulties encountered
ammunition forward led to a serious shortage.
moving
As shortages of the larger
caliber shells persisted, Twelfth Army Group limited expenditure of 240 mm
145
Caroline and More
z' 8-inch shells to 3.8 and 3.1 rounds per gun per day, respectively, in late
Goprember.?! The combat units handled the shortages as best they could.
The
I Cops reinstituted rationing from September 20 to September 30, limiting the
apenditure of both 105 mm
howitzer and 81 mm mortar ammunition.
Begining October 1 it instituted a "silent policy," hence, all its guns remained
sintercept for emergencies until October 9.
The shell supply had improved
sit by the October 10 for the corps artillery to resume active harassing,
incity, and counterbattery fire. 13 In another case of rationing, VII Corps
ordered all T105 fuses in corps, divisional, and tank destroyer units turned in
i the corps ordnance officer. Headquarters reserved the fuses for the use of
is m gun units delivering observed fire against concrete installations.! The
XIl Corps experienced similar problems; it reported shortages of 4.5-inch gun,
Binch howitzer, 155 mm gun and 155 mm howitzer ammunition.
Additional
XII Corps shortfalls included 57 mm high-explosive shells, rifle grenades, white
phosphorous ammunition, rifle grenade cartridges, and .30-caliber eight-round
rifle clips.
As the railroad system came into full-scale operation in October, the
ammunition situation improved dramatically, just as the Third Army's fighting
around Metz in October required large quantities of ammunition.
Expenditures
for one corps, for example, totaled 1,000 tons a day for a ten day period.
To
supplement the artillery, TUSA forces utilized captured German weapons in the
Metz area, firing many thousands of captured 75 mm, 88 mm, 105 mm, and
155 mm shells at the German defenses that ordnance personnel tested, tagged,
and distributed to U.S. forces.
Since no American weapons could fire 88 mm
shells, they used captured guns.
To use the large stockpile of captured 50 mm
mortar shells, ordnance personnel improvised a mortar and had it produced
locally. 16
Contributing to the deteriorating ammunition situation was the gasoline
shortage that developed during the pursuit phase.
As noted earlier, the further
the Americans advanced, the more difficult the fuel situation became, partly due
to the rate and distance.
FUSA consumed 571,000 gallons of fuel per day on
average in late August and early September."' FUSA's daily gasoline and ration
situation declined steadily throughout August and September (see Tables 7-4 and
7-5). The limited quantity of FUSA supplies in ADSEC dumps demonstrated
the difficulty the COMZ had in building up stockpiles.
Until the railroads and
pipelines reached the front, the gasoline depot personnel could not build up a
large fuel reserve forward.
The first serious gasoline shortages appeared in late August, grew worse
during the succeeding days, and seriously hindered FUSA operations.
The V
Corps G-4 centralized control of fuel issues, basing all corps allocations upon
gasoline receipts at the truckheads.
Although its units had no gasoline reserves
and most conducted day-to-day operations with less than a full tank of gas, V
Corps Headquarters reported that the fuel shortage never prevented a unit "from
fulfilling its assigned mission. "18
However, the headquarters pulled the corps'
armored division and main consumer of fuel, the Fifth Armored Division, out
