supply flow back to desired levels.
Whereas Cherbourg could supply a
maximum of thirteen divisions, Antwerp could support fifty.
Although supply operations at the invasion beaches and minor ports in
Normandy had begun as scheduled, unfortunately for COMZ, VII Corps troops
did not capture Cherbourg, the only major port in Normandy and crucial to the
American supply effort, until nearly two weeks behind schedule.
When the
heavily damaged port handled its first cargo on July 16, only 2,000 tons were
moved, but by late August engineers had the port discharging up to 12,000 tons
daily.
In the long run, the Brittany ports, deemed so vital to the overall
success of Operation OVERLORD,
played no part in American supply
operations in the summer and fall of 1944. A comparison of planned- versus
actual-capture dates and
capacities of ports specified
in the
Operation
OVERLORD supply plan reflects the distribution problems confronting the
Americans, and how until Antwerp opened, the
Americans relied almost
exclusively on the invasion beaches and Cherbourg for landing vitally needed
supplies (see Table 6-1).
When fall came and inclement weather halted beach operations, the failure to
develop the Brittany ports, delays in getting Antwerp into operation, and Paris's
daily need of 1500 tons led American planners to search desperately for
additional port capacity? COMZ developed limited substitute ports to replace
discharge capacity lost when Eisenhower and Bradley scrapped Operation
CHASTITY, and by November 10, an average of 9,900 tons of cargo per day
was being landed at Le Havre, Rouen, and Morlaix. These supplies came at a
time when daily OMAHA and UTAH beach capacity had dropped to 1,825 total
tons. When inclement weather closed both beaches in November, the opening
of additional ports enabled the Americans to maintain an average discharge
capacity of approximately 25,000 tons a day.®
While the opening of the port of Antwerp solved the American supply
problems, it was much longer in coming than expected. Although British forces
captured the port of Antwerp itself in early September, the Scheldt Estuary and
the seaward approaches to the city remained in German hands until mid-
November.' In October and early November, the Allied armies directed their
main effort to clearing the Scheldt Estuary and preparing the port for use.
After it opened in early December, Antwerp contributed an average 14,300 tons
a day during its first month in operation.
While its capacity increased
throughout early 1945, peaking at an average 20,000 tons a day in April 1945,
port operations did not impact operations until long after the pursuit across
France had ended."
Even though the development of port capacities did not progress as planned,
sufficient supplies arrived on the Continent to build large stockpiles in France.
The Normandy Base Section reported 600,000 long tons in depots in November
1944. Getting the supplies ashore proved easy when compared to the difficulties
encountered moving the materiel inland to the combat forces. When the army
rear boundary was declared on August 1, and ADSEC became responsible for
keeping the armies supplied, it relied upon truck companies, in conjunction
