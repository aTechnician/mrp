was not the case.
For example, the FUSA operations plan NEPTUNE terrain
estimate, which sought to "present the tactical and strategical features of the
terrain involved in the operation" included the word "hedges" only once and
then only
in a basic description of the terrain between the Taute river and
Bayeux. According to the description,
"the country is extensively cultivated and
consists principally of square and rectangular pastures and orchards bordered by
hedges.
nS6 Furthermore, the "Military Aspects of the Terrain" section cited the
marshy areas along the rivers in the region as the principle obstacles, but little
else. The failure to recognize the significance of the hedgerows is demonstrated
by the lack of pre-invasion training for hedgerow operations.
Considering the
number of special vehicles and weapons developed for Operation OVERLORD,
the "funnies" of the British Seventy-Ninth Division for example, the production
of hedgerow busting vehicles prior to the landing would have been helpful to the
troops who later had to fight their way through Normandy, one field at a time.5
If the terrain
1n
Normandy proved to
be
more of an obstacle than
anticipated, the logistics plan would break down. If the campaign did not go as
anticipated, the supply effort would have to be revised to meet the changing
situation ashore.
As the landing craft advanced toward the beach on the
morning of June 6, 1944, all the logistical planners could do was to see how
their planning assumptions survived both contact with the enemy and the
subsequent changes in Allied operational plans.

combined operations, to explore the possibility of constructing an artificial port. This
research resulted in plans to construct two artificial harbors off the

OVERLORD beaches, one for each invading army. These installations were to ensure
a dependable source of supply until the Normandy ports were rehabilitated by the
engineers. The project was code name, MULBERRY.
