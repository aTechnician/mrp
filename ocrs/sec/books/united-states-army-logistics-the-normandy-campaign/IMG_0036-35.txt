schedule called for 495.5 tons to arrive from D-Day to D + 14.52 See Table 2-11
for planned Civil Affairs tonnages to D+90.
While FUSA and Advanced Section, COMZ planners spent many hours
covering every conceivable logistical matter to ensure adequate supplies for the
invasion forces during the crucial early days, other logisticians devoted their
energies to ensuring the long-term supply of the American forces ashore. They
determined that the success of the American supply effort depended on the rapid
occupation of French ports.
Operation
OVERLORD planners ranked the
capture of the Brittany peninsula, with its ports, second in importance only to
securing a beachhead in Normandy.
The plan called for American forces to
break out from Normandy and drive south, then west, to liberate the Brittany
ports of Nantes,
St.
Nazaire, and Brest.
The Operation
OVERLORD
logisticians deemed these ports crucial to meeting the long-term supply needs
of the American forces in France.
An examination of the planned-versus-actual
capture date and capacities of the French ports
illustrates the importance
planners placed on the ports.
Although the beaches and minor Normandy ports
would fall into American hands on D-Day as planned (see Table 2-12 for the
planned versus actual occupation dates and capacities of French Ports) the timely
occupation of the larger French ports, most crucial to the long-term success of
the invasion, was another matter.
Fears that French ports would not fall into American hands or meet supply
requirements once captured led to the development of Operation CHASTITY in
April 1944. Logisticians, recognizing that capturing and restoring the Brittany
ports would require large numbers of combat and support personnel, informed
SHAEF that "regardless of how we [logistical planners] crowd and stretch the
facilities, we shall not have sufficient capacity to deliver the tonnage needed to
support all the armies in their
Therefore,
authorized changes in the plan. Operation CHASTITY called for delaying the
capture of Nantes and St. Nazaire while developing a major port facility at
Quiberon Bay on the south coast of the Brittany peninsula between Lorient and
St. Nazaire.
Reconnaissance indicated that Quiberon Bay had 3,000 yards of
suitable beaches and sufficient anchorage for 200 liberty ships.
Moreover,
transportation personnel deemed the road and rail net sufficient to meet
American needs.55
Planners concluded that the Quiberon
Bay project in
conjunction with Brest would provide the required logistical flow needed to meet
the long-term needs of the American forces on the Continent.
Only time would
tell if Operation CHASTITY evolved as planned.
The complexity of logistical planning for the invasion, and attention to detail
overshadowed the most serious logistical problem which the army actually
confronted in the summer of 1944.
Predicating
Operation
OVERLORD
planning on the Allied forces advancing at a prescribed rate, while necessary for
planning purposes, proved a serious error in light of the fact that most Operation
OVERLORD planners overlooked or underestimated the effect of the terrain in
Normandy.
The impact of the hedgerows, stoutly defended by determined
German soldiers, should have been anticipated and taken into account.
