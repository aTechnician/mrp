supplies, rations, presented the fewest
problems.
Since soldiers consumed
rations at a steady rate, prediction of quantities needed was relatively easy;
Based on the experience of previous operations, quartermaster planners called
for 2.21 tons of rations per 1000 men with a 25 percent loss factor. 32 For the
initial period of the operation, plans called for rations to arrive in 500 long-ton
blocks, each feeding 21,000 men for ten days.
Prestowed merchant ships,
capable of carrying twelve or thirteen of these blocks, sat offshore filled with
rations, and engineer and signal equipment.
Although the initial blocks
consisted entirely of field rations, over time quartermasters altered the contents
of each block to provide variety and better rations for the troops, who preferred
B and 10-in-1 rations over the C and D varieties.33
About D+40 ships loaded
exclusively with rations, each carrying 2.5 million balanced B rations and
500,000 operational rations, were to arrive. 3* Thus, the forces on the Continent
during the Normandy operation and the drive across France, except for short-
term distribution problems, had sufficient rations. Calculating the requirements
for the other supply classes, however, proved more difficult.

Notes:
Actual Tonnage Allocations by FUSAG, 19 April 1944. 20,377 long tons of
rations, 12,839 long tons of POL, 10,286 long tons of ordnance Class V, and
2,700 tons chemical warfare Class V on D+41.

Quartermaster personnel found it fairly easy to calculate the expenditure of
Class Il and IV supplies (clothing, equipment and regular supplies) or so they
thought. From D-Day to D+3, the planners expected the troops to make do
with what they carried on their backs.
From D+4 through D+14 beach
maintenance sets were to meet the quartermaster Class Il and IV supply
requirements of units ashore, each set including everything needed to maintain
5,000 men for fifteen days (75,000 man-days of supply).
