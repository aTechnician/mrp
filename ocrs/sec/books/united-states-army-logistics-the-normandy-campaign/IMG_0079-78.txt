18d and elements of 769th Military Police Battalions controlled movement of
moys, the Medical Service provided medical support, the Signal Service
povided communications,
and the Transportation Corps Motor Transport
Brigade operated the trucks. 58
On August 25, the first day of the operation, the Motor Transport Brigade's
sity seen truck companies, with 3,358 trucks in operation, hauled 4,482 tons
iro. Most truck companies used 2.5-ton models, as there was a serious
shortage of six-, ten-, and twelve-ton semitrailer vehicles.
Although the
hater transportation officer repeatedly called for more of these vehicles, they
yur did not exist, since the War Department had not anticipated their need. 5º
On thefth day, August 29, the Red Ball Express flow peaked when 132 truck
companies, 5,958 trucks, moved 12,342 tons at a rate of up to 400 trucks per
Of the initial 100,000 tons moved by September 5, the Red Ball Express
ransported 88,939 tons.52 The cargo included 15,040 tons of rations; 29,791
ions of equipment and regular supplies; 19,047 tons of POL; and 25,061 tons
ofammunition. The Military Railway Service moved an additional 47,912 tons
ofall types forward by rail from Le Mans, Chartres, and Dreux. 63 To speed up
the movement of supplies, trucks hauled cargoes to rail transfer points near
Paris. Fortunately, railroads outside the Normandy area had suffered relatively
ite damage and engineers quickly put them into operation.
After COMZ extended the operation,
originally scheduled to end on
Seember 5, for an indefinite period, headquarters informed FUSA and TUSA
that they each would receive only 3,500 tons a dav for the foreseeable future 64
During the seventy-two day phase of Red Ball Express operations that lasted
until November 16, the Red Ball transported 315,225 tons of supplies to
forward depots or to Paris for
transfer to trains, including 66,477 tons of
rations, 105,362 tons of equipment and regular supplies, 74,729 tons of POL,
and 52,783 tons of ammunition.
The average daily haul of this period was
4,552 tons of all classes, and on the peak day, September 18, Red Ball truckers
"Red Ball, 3 February 1945,"
hauled 8,882 tons, while on the slowest day, November 16, only 299 tons
moved forward. 6s
The railroads also moved cargo to the troops. The chief of transportation
proposed on September 18 that the Red Ball route terminate east of Paris, where
cargoes could be transferred to rail cars.
He argued that since the Military
Railway Service had ample rolling stock to carry 2,000 tons to each army per
day, transferring supplies to rail cars would free up trucks for other duties.
The
first truck-rail transfers east of Paris took place on September 29 at the Paris
transfer points, including FUSA's at La Courneuve and TUSA's at Vincennes-
Fonteney.
Railway personnel established an additional transfer point for the
Ninth Army at Ruilly on October 4. As of November 3, no Red Ball trucks ran
east of Paris unless approved by the COMZ G-4.6 In addition to the supplies
moved by truck, 498,367 tons cleared the railheads during the period of the Red
Ball Express.
The quantity of supplies moved increased from 2,772 tons on
