Introduction
The Allied invasion of Northwest Europe in June 1944, Operation OVERLORD,
was the largest amphibious undertaking in military history. The logistical effort
in support of the operation was similarly impressive.
While the Supreme
Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in the United Kingdom dealt with
strategic issues, the national supply organizations handled the day-to-day support
of their respective forces.
Responsible for seeing that the American Army in
France received all the supplies and services necessary to conduct military
operations, the Services of Supply (SOS), later designated the Communications
Zone (COMZ), served as a giant conduit for manpower and supplies pouring
into Europe from Britain and the United States.
The efficiency of the COMZ
determined the level of logistical support reaching frontline combat units.
The dilemma confronting
the military historian with regard to D-Day
logistical planning and the subsequent performance of the American supply
organization in Europe in the summer of 1944 is defining its success or failure.
Typical official army
postwar evaluations of the logistical effort have
included such comments as the "progress and development of the logistical units
of COMZ is considered to have been as satisfactory as could possibly be
expected, under the circumstances of changed plans and the accelerated schedule
of the entire operation far beyond anything which was anticipated," and "the
supplying of our armed forces in Europe has been a remarkable achievement,
involving
the delivery
across the ocean
and
over beaches and through
demolished ports, and then over a war-torn countryside
into France and
Germany of tonnages far in excess of anything previously within the conception
of man. "1
Although
both comments are generally correct, they downplay
difficulties and use the Allied victory over Nazi Germany as a vague
benchmark.
There were a few officers critical of the COMZ's performance during the
war. Major General Henry Aurand, commander of the Normandy Base Section
and much closer to the day-to-day operations of the COMZ than Lieutenant
