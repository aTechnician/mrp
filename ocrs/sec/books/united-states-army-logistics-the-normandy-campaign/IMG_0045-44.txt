week of August, a 300 percent increase.
late July figures are
compared with fuel consumption during the first week following D-Day, fuel
consumption increased from .6 gallons per
vehicle per day to 18 gallons, a
3,000 percent increase.
In June and July the POL supply proved adequate for
operations in Normandy; the distribution system worked despite the delays in
capturing Cherbourg and constructing the POL System.
The true test of the
POL system came when the American forces broke out from Normandy and
commenced mobile operations.
Overall, the First Army's supply distribution system improved steadily from
D-day to July 31.
The great Channel storm of June 19-22 represented a major
setback, but one that the ESBs rapidly overcame with emergency measures and
increased efforts on the beaches.
The FUSA reserves for the period June 19 to
July 31, stated in ration days, POL days, and ammunition units of fire (see
Table 3-3) indicates the
successes
and
failures
of the
American supply
distribution effort. It is clear that during the months of June and July, the period
of the buildup and the heavy fighting in the hedgerows, that supplying Class I
(rations) and Class III (POL) presented FUSA forces with few problems, and
reserves of these remained constant or increased steadily.
The ammunition supply remained the critical problem area.
As the supply
of mortar and artillery ammunition fluctuated greatly, FUSA stopped recording
ammunition reserve levels for lack of up-to-date information.
Despite the
distribution problems, emergency measures ensured an adequate supply of
ammunition, but ammunition shortages, as will be seen, persisted throughout the
campaign in Northwest Europe.
Another means
of evaluating the successes and failures of the supply
distribution system in France in June and July
1944 is to compare planned
versus actual numbers for supply tonnage, vehicle and troop build-up in the
period.
Buildup figures reveal that the supply system fell behind early but for
the most part, exceeded daily tonnage levels and reached nearly 100 percent of
the cumulative planned tonnages by the end of July (see Table 3-4). Measuring
success by the quantity of materials moved did have its drawbacks.
example, a quartermaster base depot company arrived ashore on July 20 and
reported the arrival of 11,070 corn brooms and 12,789 cotton mops.
Moreover,
the unit questioned the need for 5,269 large garbage cans and 32,616 reams of
mimeograph paper, items which did little to win the war in the short run or
meet the ammunition needs of the troops blasting through the hedgerows.?6
Overall, supply distribution in June and July went fairly well considering the
complexity of operations.
After the war, the U.S. Army convened a series of
general boards to examine its performance during the war. Major General
Royal
Lord headed the board that prepared the report Supply
Maintenance On The European Continent.
And
Lord had served as chief of staff of
the COMZ and deputy chief of staff ETOUSA."
The report reviewed the
supply effort in France, and concluded that a succession of events which "had
not and probably could not have been foreseen" had upset the supply distribution
system and had produced both positive and negative effects. 78
