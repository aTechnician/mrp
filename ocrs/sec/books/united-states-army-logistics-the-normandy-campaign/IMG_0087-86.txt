United States Army Logistics

A comparison of FUSA's daily maintenance requirements with ADSEC's
ability to move supplies forward outline the basic transportation problem that
confronted supply personnel. At the end of August, when FUSA submitted its
daily maintenance requirements, First Army planners had calculated that they
needed a minimum of 5,752 tons of logistical support each day to maintain the
advance, while the Third Army called for 6,699.61 tons (see Table 7-1).2 On
September 6, COMZ informed FUSA and TUSA that since the supply system
could only deliver 7,000 tons to the front, until further notice, both armies
would receive 3,500 tons of supplies a day.
Since First Army planners had
already determined they needed at least 3,300 tons of ammunition and fuel, to
say nothing of rations and other vital items, the decision not to give FUSA
supply priority, according to Charles MacDonald effectively ended any hope of
concluding the war by Christmas because FUSA, rather than Twenty-first Army
Group or TUSA, was in the best position to bring a quick end to the war with
a single thrust into Germany.3
To deal with the shortfall, FUSA established a rationing system, under which
each of its services received a tonnage allocation from headquarters.
FUSA's
average allocations for the period September 6-12, when compared with the
average tonnage received from COMZ, indicates how distribution fell short of
the 3,500 tons promised (see Table 7-2).
Those limits remained in effect until
COMZ raised the daily tonnage level to 5,000 tons per army per day on
September 23, then to 5,400 tons on September 25, and to 6,500 tons on
October 4, but increased tonnage levels proved overly optimistic, and the supply
system once again failed to meet its commitments.*
The average FUSA
allocations compared with average receipts, September 13-October 15, again
demonstrated that COMZ deliveries did not reach promised levels (see Table 7-
Although the delivery of supplies improved in late September and early
October, COMZ failed to keep up with promised increases in daily allocations.
Moreover, ADSEC often sent "filler" tonnage with the deliveries, that is,
anything on hand to replace out-of-stock items.
Since depots often lacked
requisitioned Class Il and IV items, delivery of unordered items became so
serious that early in October FUSA requested a general policy change, calling
on COMZ to make "every effort to fill requisitions as submitted."
FUSA
argued that if a depot did not contain an item requisitioned, the depot personnel
should backlog the order and make up the tonnage with Class I and ill goods.
When the items became available, they could then be shipped in Class I or III
space. A team of Twelfth Army Group officers followed requisitions through
the system to see what happened and as a result the problem eased somewhat.'
The failure of the supply system to deliver even minimum promised levels
resulted in serious shortages at the front.
Continent remained sufficient to feed the army ashore, ration use did exceed
planned levels by 30 percent.
Although ration supply on the
Moreover, the limited cargo capacity of the
Transportation Corps led many frontline units to utilize their ration reserves to
free up truck space for other badly needed materiels. As a result, FUSA ration
reserves declined steadily throughout the early part of September, with 4.4 days
