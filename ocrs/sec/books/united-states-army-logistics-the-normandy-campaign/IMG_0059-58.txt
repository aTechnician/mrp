The ammunition allocations were periodically adjusted to
take into account revised estimates of ammunition on hand (see Table 4-5).
Modifications continued right up to the beginning of the operation. A FUSA
message on July 22 increased the expenditure of 81 mm light shells by five
rounds per day per tube until 0600 on D+1 when the army authorized an
additional five rounds per weapon. 2 Only allowing ten rounds per tube for an
attack illustrated the gravity of the mortar shell shortage. On July 24 General
Omar Bradley authorized each corps to fire an additional 200 rounds of 155 mm
howitzer and 200 rounds of 155 mm gun ammunition for counterflak operation
on D-Day of Operation COBRA.63
The First Army punched through the
German line near St. Lô on July 25 and began its drive to the German border.

Ammunition supplies remained dangerously low in some categories (see Table
6). Expenditure limits remained in effect but on D-Day of Operation
COBRA, General Bradley informed all corps that they could consider the
amuntion for 0600 July 25 to 0600 July 30 as a block allocation. That meant
Stuti culd fire off ammunition as they wished-but had to make it last five
days, Theoretically, if a corps expended all its ammunition by July 28, it would
tart to do without until the thirtieth. With the offensive underway, FUSA
imited the ammunition allocation for the Second and Fifth Infantry Divisions

rained in fect, they quickly lost much of their significance as the breakout
tuned into a pursuit.
