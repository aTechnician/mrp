Acknowledgments
I wish to acknowledge the assistance of all who aided me in one way or another
with the preparation of this work.
The staffs of the National Archives, Dwight
D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, and the United States Military History
Institute have all been most helpful.
I owe a special debt of gratitude to my
Dissertation Committee
Chair,
Dr. Joseph G. Dawson III,
whose patient
guidance and expertise made this book possible.
I must also thank Professor
Roger Beaumont, Professor Arnold Krammer, Professor Chester Dunning, and
Professor Charles Smith for their encouragement and counsel. A special thanks
to the many World War II veterans that answered my call for assistance.
Their
recollections were most helpful. For the graphics I thank Professor Don Frazier
of Frazier Educational Resources, Abilene,
Texas who did an excellent job
producing organizational charts, maps and selected tables for this work.
Finally
I must thank my parents and brother for their unwavering support even though
the end often seemed nowhere in sight.
