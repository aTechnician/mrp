per 45,000-man division slice as their usage figure, with gasoline accounting for
84.6 percent of the total.
The SHAEF POL section, using this data to establish
new POL factors, produced new consumption figures: 153 short tons of POL
per 40,000-man division slice in combat and 45.5 long tons of POL per 40,000-
man division in reserve.
The new figures had no impact on the first ninety days
of the Normandy operation, as POL to D +90 had already been requisitioned
from the Ministry of Fuel and Power.
Despite three years of war, American logistical planners could only make
educated guesses when they calculated POL consumption for the upcoming
campaign.
If distribution had not been such a problem, fuel-consumption
estimates would have meant very little. Getting the approximately seven million
long tons of POL stored in the United Kingdom by D-Day to the Continent and
then to the troops that needed it would be the greatest task confronting the
logisticians. 40
To meet POL requirements
in the short term, until necessary pipelines
became operational,
quartermasters
packaged the gasoline
in
five gallon
jerricans, a vital means of keeping the frontline units supplied with fuel. Troops
were to save the empty containers and return them for refilling at a bulk fuel
decanting point.
Supply personnel, with the cooperation of the combat forces,
were to recycle each jerrican through the
system every
thirteen
days.
Quartermaster planners estimated can losses at 15 percent from D-Day to
D+ 30, 10 percent from D+31 to D+60, and 5 percent after D+ 61. If the loss
estimates proved overly optimistic, gas can shortages would develop. From
D+3 to D+ 14, the plan called for 37 percent of the POL to arrive loaded on
