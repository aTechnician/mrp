hedgerows, a more sensitive fuse was produced in France.l9 Such expedients,
although effective, could not solve the larger problem of a general shortage of
weapons best suited for close-in hedgerow fighting.
Ordnance Class Il and IV shortages during the build-up phase in Normandy
included all types of ordnance, not just small arms. At various times, the FUSA
critical shortage list included medium tanks, 105 mm howitzers,
60 mm
mortars, 81 mm mortars, M15 and M16 half-tracks, jeeps, DUKW parts, and
155 mm M-12 motor carriage parts. During the first few days of the landing,
artillery losses ran high. On D-Day, when seventeen 105 mm howitzers failed
to reach the beach because their landing craft was hit and sunk, FUSA requested
the immediate shipment of eight and nine 105 mm howitzers for the Twenty-
ninth and First Infantry Divisions, respectively. 20 Armor losses also ran heavier
than planners anticipated.
For example, the Third Armored Group reported
fifty-seven tanks lost by June 15.21
Tank reserves on the Continent remained
at zero throughout June and July 22
By the end of June, the situation had improved greatly, only M7 grenade
launchers and BARs were listed in short supply. While ordnance Class Il and
IV shortages at army level decreased, they continued at divisional level
throughout July, at the end of which the First Infantry Division's critical
ordnance shortages included 1 jeep, 72 pairs of binoculars, 239 trench knives
with scabbards, 260 M7 grenade launchers, 19 bazookas, 3 60 mm mortars, and
1 M61 telescopic sight.23
Such shortages,
while interesting,
longer
represented a serious problem.
ADSEC found the Class Il and IV shortage much easier to deal with than
the ammunition shortage that plagued FUSA throughout late June and July
marking the second phase of supply shortages during the buildup in Normandy.
The Class V supply difficulties, which began on D-Day, did not reach crisis
levels until the great channel storm which began on June 19. As early as June
14, the V Corps ammunition officer, investigating a reported shortage of 105
mm shells, learned that most of a large quantity that had been brought ashore
the night of June 13-14 had been hauled away by VII Corps supply personnel,
leaving only 2,700 rounds in the OMAHA ammunition dumps. FUSA informed
ADSEC of the problem and ordered additional ammunition ashore to alleviate
the shortage. 24
Until the requested ammunition arrived, FUSA ordered 105 mm M2, 155
mm howitzer M1, and 155 mm gun M1 shells rationed for three days beginning
at midnight on June 14. With expenditures limited to 15,000 rounds of 105
mm, 2,000 rounds of 155 mm howitzer, and 800 rounds of 155 mm gun shells,
V Corps allocated the First Infantry Division 8,475 105 mm rounds and 1,000
155 mim rounds and the Second Infantry Division 6,525 105 mm rounds and
1,000 155 mm rounds? Those limits could, with FUSA approval, be exceeded
and often were. For example, when the First Infantry Division G-4 requested
permission to fire an extra 3,000 rounds of 105 mm and 600 rounds of 155 mm
howitzer shells on June 16, FUSA approved 26

BARs and Mortar Shells
As policies regarding artillery ammunition supply changed frequently,
fontine commanders had a difficult time keeping abreast of current policy. For
crample, at 2110 on June 17, V Corps artillery learned that FUSA would lift
rations on 105 mm and 155 mm ammunition at 2400, ending three days of
raining. At 2330, however, FUSA notified corps artillery that rationing
would continue for two more days. With an authorization to expend 18,000 105
mm rounds and 3,500 155 mm rounds, V Corps Headquarters allocated rounds
as follows: First Infantry Division, 9,000 105 mm and 1,400 155 mm; Second
Infantry Division, 9,000 105 mm and 1,400 155 mm rounds; and 955th Field
Arillery Battalion, 700 155 mm."
On June 19, the V Corps artillery was
advised rationing would expire at 2400 as planned and would not be extended
but that plan did not last long since the storm which hit that day halted
unloading of supplies for seventy-two hours and forced FUSA Headquarters to
use the limited reserves built up ashore.
The disruption of beach operations caused by the storm required emergency
messures to conserve the ammunition already ashore and to speed additional
shell across the Channel as quickly as possible.
When V Corps G-4 Colonel
Mood met on June 20, with the headquarters of the Second Infantry Division,
the Twenty-third Infantry Regiment, and the Third Battalion of the Thirty-eighth
Infanty Regiment, they reported no supply shortages but they discussed the
number of artillery rounds allowed at each gun position. The Second Infantry
Division wanted to position 200 and 100 rounds of 105 mm howitzer and 155
mn howitzer ammunition at each position respectively, a move requiring the
approval of the corps artillery officer? At 1720, on June 21, FUSA notified
the V Corps ordnance officer that except in emergency cases, the expenditure
and withdrawal of all types of ordnance Class V would be limited to one-third
UlF per day. 30 The V and VII Corps G-4s complained about the slow arrival
of ammunition on the Continent and VII Corps' units hoarding of shells." VII
COrps Headquarters had already ordered, on June 18, that units possess no more
than a basic load of ammunition.
Before a unit could draw more, it had to
expend everything over its basic load 32 This situation did not last long, since
on June 23, the first day after the storm, the FUSA G-4 authorized an increase
that permitted each artillery battery its basic load plus 200 rounds of 105 mm
or 100 rounds of 155 mm ammunition. FUSA ordered all units to turn in all
shells over these levels to an army supply point."
Units often violated the one-third U/F limit imposed by FUSA to conserve
ammunition, even though they had to report all overages to corps headquarters
which then had to report to FUSA.
The repeated expenditure of ammunition
above the authorized level led the V Corps artillery officer to repeatedly warn
the commanding generals of both the First and
Second Divisions to halt
excessive expenditures (see Table 4-1). To provide additional ammunition to
the two infantry division, V Corps Headquarters ordered the Second Armored
Division to give its one-third U/F allocation to the First and Second divisions.
This move
gave each division an additional
1,125
rounds of
105 mm
ammunition. 34
Even with the added shells, the divisions continued to exceed
