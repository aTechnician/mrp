routing the pipeline from La Haye du Puits east toward Vire and Mortain, rather
than southward, delayed construction for twenty days as the Germans held the
Vire-Mortain area into mid-August. When American forces finally cleared the
Vire-Mortain pocket, the pipeline was extended to Chartres and then on to a
terminal at Coubert south of Paris.31
One six-inch pipeline reached Domfront on August 21, from which, tank
trucks hauled fuel to Le Mans where POL personnel had established a 200,000-
gallon decanting point. On August 27, two days after Paris fell, another
200,000 gallon POL installation opened at Ablis.
A few days later, after the
pipeline reached Alençon, bulk fuel arrived at Ablis from both pipeheads.
Despite the advance of the pipeline to Chartres and Dourdan on September 13
and 22, respectively, most gas reaching FUSA and TUSA arrived in packaged
form. 32
The POL engineers found constructing the pipeline a difficult task. While
their crews could lay up to thirty miles of six-inch pipe in a day, it then took
ten hours of pipeline capacity to fill the newly laid pipe, that is, to move the
pipehead forward required shutting down the pipeline for up to ten hours a
day. That meant losing pipeline capacity that could never be recovered. A
400,000-gallon-a-day pipeline could never give more. If pipeline personnel drew
only 300,000 gallons one day,500,000 could not be drawn the next day, since
the 100,000 gallons of capacity not used was permanently lost. 34
Because the
troops needed gasoline immediately, ADSEC diverted fuel to trucks rather than
using it to fill new sections of the line, which required a substantial quantity of
fuel. On September 13, for example, the pipeline held over 200,000 barrels 35
When engineers diverted fuel into new sections of the pipeline they often leaked.
The new part of the line from Vire to Domfront leaked so badly when filled that
it had to be shut down for a time to repair the problems, and trucks continued
to haul fuel from Vire even after the pipehead had
moved forward to
Domfront 36 As the pipelines failed to keep pace, the American advance was
curtailed.
By late September, the Military Pipeline Service had three lines in operation,
the closest still twenty miles from the Seine.
Not until October 1 did pipelines
reach the outskirts of Paris at Alençon and Vincennes where engineers set up
decanting facilities, from which railway tank cars and tank trucks moved the
gasoline forward from Paris.37
Five-gallon cans remained the primary means
of dispensing fuel at the front." The pipelines and bulk fuel proved crucial in
keeping the combat units moving as packaged fuel could not meet their total
requirements (see Table 6-2). As a result, despite arrival on the Continent of
millions of gallons of fuel,
gasoline remained critically short at the front
throughout August and September. That shortage resulted from several factors,
but transportation difficulties caused the most problems.
From September 6 to
12, for example, FUSA used an average of 571,000 gallons of gasoline a day."
TUSA requested 500,000 plus gallons as well. Between September 13 and 20,
FUSA requirements, determined by FUSA Headquarters, totaled 6,865,235
gallons of gasoline and 233,594 gallons of diesel. 1°

along the Vire-Mortain line in early August. That taxing of ADSEC's limited
truck resources left few trucks available to build up the army service area.
FUSA and TUSA had to use their own trucks to meet all their tactical as well
For instance, in mid-August, FUSA had to support three
corps with a supply line that started in the north and circled around the German
position to replenish the corps from the south, move its army service area 150
miles forward, and support heavy troop movements-all at the same time."
Moreover, as all FUSA petroleum had to be hauled in its own trucks
exclusively, the gasoline shortage started and continued throughout August and
September (see Table 6-3). Only 2.21 percent of the POL transported to FUSA
during the period August 19 to 26, for example, arrived in ADSEC trucks.
Furthermore, the armies rapidly exhausted their stockpiles of equipment and
regular supplies (Class II and IV items) and acute shortages developed. 42
ADSEC found itself running a race in which it always remained a step
quickly outran its service area located
Villedieu-Vire (August 6-19).
Before a proposed site at Alençon could be
developed, the army advanced further east and made the Alençon site unusable.
FUSA selected La Loupe to replace Villedieu-Vire as the army service area,
where it remained from August 19 to 29, after which it was moved to Hirson
La Capelle until September 12.
From September 13 to October 22 FUSA
located its service area in the vicinity of Liége-Eupen. 43
Stocking the La Loupe depot alone required moving 62,000 tons of supplies
forward. ADSEC informed FUSA it could only move 26,000 tons in ten days
