maintenance set, for example, included 500 wool drawers and 200 steel helmets.
The seventy-three beach maintenance sets in the final plan equalled 5,475,000
man-days of supply.
From D+15 to D+43, plans called for follow-up
maintenance sets to meet Class Il and IV needs ashore, each containing 450,000
man-days of supply.
Tables 2-7 and 2-8 include a complete listing of items
contained in beach maintenance and follow-up maintenance sets.
Beginning
around D+30 ships carrying Class Il and IV supplies were to arrive directly
from the United States with type-loads, ships loaded with only one or two types
of items. 35
Quartermaster personnel determined the number and type of Class II and IV
items within the
beach
maintenance
and
follow-up maintenance
sets by
multiplying the replacement factors for each item by the projected troop strength
on the Continent.
Planners based replacement factors on the lifespan of the
items in question. Items which wore out quickly had high-replacement factors. 36
The success or failure of the system depended upon
the accuracy of the
replacement rates. If items wore out slower or faster than anticipated, surpluses
or shortages would develop.
Each branch of the army handled the acquisition and distribution of its own
unique Class Il and IV items.
The ordnance plan called for bulk Class Il items
to arrive with replacement vehicles to D+ 15.
Thus the material would never
be out of Ordnance hands.
Beginning D+ 15, the limited bulk shipping of Class
Il items would enable ordnance units to maintain their basic load and a fifteen
day reserve by D+41.
Thus when ADSEC took control of the rear area
following the declaration of the army rear boundary the ordnance units would
have few bulk supplies to turn over.
From D+41 on, ADSEC would handle
ordnance requisitions and shipment of all supplies.37
Class Ill (POL) and Class V (ammunition) presented the planners with the
most problems, since usage depended heavily on the rate of advance.
Heavy,
static fighting increased ammunition demands and reduced consumption of POL,
while a rapid advance against light resistance had an opposite affect.
The
problem confronting the planners was prediction of the rate of advance of the
invading force in order to calculate expenditure rates.
POL planners,
determining consumption and devising means
of distribution,
calculated
requirements like other supplies.
They multiplied POL logistical factors (see
Table 2-9) set forth in the final quartermaster plan of April 30, 1944, by the
estimated number of personnel and vehicles ashore for a given day of the
operation.
Moreover, the invasion forces required sufficient POL to build up
reserve stocks.
Plans called for the army to maintain a seven-day fuel reserve
while the COMZ would stockpile a three-day reserve by D+41 and a twenty-
one day reserve by D + 90.38 The army's previous experience determined these
factors.
POL requisitions for Operation OVERLORD, based
the
above
logistical factors, were submitted well before the invasion. In May 1944, Allied
Forces Headquarters (AFHO) in the Mediterranean theater provided information
on fuel-usage levels during the Italian campaign. AFHO used 150 tons of POL
