United States Army Logistics

is easy enough to minimize a problem by chalking it up as an unforeseeable
event, this report slides past the most serious problems and represents the views
of the victor analyzing a victorious campaign.
The authors of the report
conclude that the supply difficulties encountered must not have been too severe,
for the Allies won the war.
In reality, the American supply system came close to failing.
General
Moses, Twelfth Army Group G-4, recognized the narrowness of margins when
he concluded that "without meeting planned buildup in either supplies or service
troops, logistical development and support was,
with certain exceptions,
generally satisfactory; the most unfavorable aspect was the lack of safety
factors. "31 The lack of "safety factors" (extra increments of supplies on hand)
meant that when part of the system failed, another part had to take up the slack
or else the whole system would collapse. Historian James Huston summed up
the other side of the equation when he noted that the
"surprise came in the
quantity of goods that could be landed over the beaches, and this type of
unloading continued as a major activity far beyond the time originally
planned. "82
Supply personnel strove valiantly to make the distribution system
work as the invasion forces fought to secure and enlarge the beachhead.
beach operations had not exceeded expectations, the loss of MULBERRY A and
the failure to capture Cherbourg on schedule could very well have spelled
disaster for Allied forces on the Normandy beachhead

had an additional reason to resist beaching LSTs:
a fear of German artillery fire.
According to Bradley, the navy held the view that "while our tanks were expendable,
(their] ships presumably were not."
