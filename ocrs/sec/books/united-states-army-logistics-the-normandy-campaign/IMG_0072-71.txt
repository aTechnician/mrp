Confusion Continues
Setion Number Three, headquartered in Cherbourg and soon designated Normandy
But Section, commenced operation on August 7, 1944 and took over from the
Cherbourg Command (provisional) following its deactivation.
The Normandy Base
Setion was divided into the Granville, OMAHA, and UTAH districts on October 6.
The Granville district was dissolved on November 27, its territory absorbed by the
acher two districts. Base Section Number One became the Brittany Base Section on
August 16. Base Section Number Two became the Loire Section, not the Loire Base
Setion as most in the higher headquarters persisted in calling it, on August 22. With
the decision not to develop the Brittany ports, the Loire Section was absorbed by the
Brittany Base Section at the end of November.
Base Section Number Four became the
Intermediate Section, and Base Section Number Five became the Seine Section on
August 22. The Intermediate Section was redesignated the Channel Base Section on
September 15. The Seine Section established its headquarters in Paris on August 26.
On September 15 the Oise Base Section, later the Oise Intermediate Base Section, was
evablished with the mission of taking over COMZ activities in the area relinquished by
ADSEC east of the Seine. In Southern France, the Continental Advance Section served
as the ADSEC to the Seventh U.S. Army.
On October 1, the Delta Base Section
transferred from Corsica to Southern France. On November 1, ETOUSA and COMZ
took over functions of the North African Theater of Operations in France, creating the
Southern Line of Communications (SOLOC) on November 3, to handle supply
functions in France.
