that all vehicles would land with full grease guns.
With regard to ammunition,
plans called for each unit to arrive in France with a basic load—the normal
quantity carried by a unit for each weapon, plus spare primers, fuses,
and
blasting caps.
As the planners anticipated that anti-aircraft (AA) units would
expend ammunition at a greater rate than others, AA units landed in France with
a basic load plus one unit of fire (U/F).27
In addition to ordnance, the plan
called for each assault unit to carry a two-day supply of essential medical items.
Water, a half-gallon per man per day and two and a half gallons per wounded
man per day, was scheduled to arrive for the first two days of the operation.
Of course, administrators required each unit landing in France to carry a thirty-
day supply of blank forms and stationery. 28
While the assault forces went ashore with what was seen as sufficient
supplies to gain a foothold on the
Continent,
maintaining
that foothold
depended heavily on logistical planners.
They formulated separate plans for
each class of supply; Class I, rations; Class II and IV, clothing, equipment and
regular supplies; Class III, POL; and Class V, ammunition. 29
The "logistical factors" that shaped those plans were based on a set number
of pounds per man per day, and the amount of supplies of a specific type
required by each
soldier needed
each day.
The logistical factors used
tocalculate supply maintenance requirements for the ninety-day period following
D-Day are detailed in Table 2-4.
The pounds-per-man-per-day estimates meant nothing without some idea of
the number of soldiers and vehicles expected on the Continent on any given day.
By multiplying the logistical factors by the number of troops and vehicles on a
given day, planners calculated minimum supply requirements per day for the
campaign.
These calculations did not take into account the buildup of reserves,
which required tonnages above the day-to-day supply requirements.
The buildup
figures used are detailed in Table 2-5.
The schedule for the buildup of reserves on the Continent relied primarily
on the "day of supply"
(D/S)
concept-the quantity of materials needed to
supply everyone with an item for one day.
For example, one ration day of
supply represented sufficient rations to feed every American on the Continent
for twenty-four hours.
This concept produced the build-up schedule in Table
2-6. The shortage of landing craft, especially LSTs and other supply vessels,
prevented planners from moving men, equipment, and supplies to the Continent
as rapidly as they would have liked. Logistical personnel prestowed 90,000 tons
of supplies on coasters, landing craft, and motor transport ships (adapted
"liberty" ships), enough to meet the army's needs for eight days of operations. 30
Early in the planning process the quartermaster truck companies slated for
the invasion were left empty in anticipation of last-minute tonnage requirements.
As planning progressed, their 3,835 tons of emergency lift were utilized, and
planning staffs looked for more. 31
For every ton of lift capacity located, there
seemed to be an additional 1.5 tons of cargo to move.
As transportation
remained a chronic problem throughout Operation OVERLORD, each class of
supply presented planning staffs with a unique set of difficulties.
