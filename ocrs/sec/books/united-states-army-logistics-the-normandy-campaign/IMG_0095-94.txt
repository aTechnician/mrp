49. American servicemen have always been good scroungers.
Their efforts prior
to the twentieth century dealt primarily with the supplementing their meager rations or
acquiring such items as boots, blankets, coffee, and tobacco.
Soldiers stationed along
the frontier prior to the Civil War often grew vegetables and kept livestock to
supplement their diet.
During the Civil War Union troops were known to trade coffee
to Confederate soldiers for tobacco.
The advent of modern warfare with its dependence
on everything from gasoline to signal wire has made the scrounger even more
important. Sources relating to supply improvisation are limited.

The
Campaigns of France and Germany, 1944-1945. (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University

The best sources of
information regarding the topic are unit histories and interviews with veterans who
participated in the operations in France in 1944-1945.
