authorized artillery expenditure limits.
While, as detailed in the proceeding chapter, forces ashore attempted to stay
within expenditure limits, the supply elements worked frantically to move
ammunition to rebuild army reserves on the Continent. As soon as the weather
cleared following the storm, emergency air supply commenced on June 24 with
twenty C-47s per hour landing on among four airfields during daylight hours
carrying approximately two tons of ammunition each. 35
1800 June 24, aircraft flew in 430 tons of ammunition in addition to the 16,915
tons landed over the beaches.
From 1800 June 23 to

required a large quantity of artillery ammunition

meet its reserve
requirements. For example, on June 25, FUSA had 214,000 105 mm howitzer
M2; 57,000 155 mm howitzer M1; and 10,522 8-inch howitzer shells on hand,
but was, repectively, 282,500; 93,500; and 15,740 shells short of reserve
requirements.37
The quantities short are somewhat misleading,
since those
figures represented the quantity of ammunition needed to meet the five U/F-per-
gun reserve requirement on the Continent. Offloading over the beaches eased
the ammunition situation following the storm. The June 28 FUSA G-4 report
indicated 305,396 105 mm shells on hand and only 31,954 needed to reach the
five U/F level. On June 29, FUSA reported no critical Class V shortages. The
apparent abundance of shells led to calls for an end to firing restrictions. When

die Second Armored Division G-4 asked the V Corps G-4 on July 1 if the one-
did U policy remained in effect, he replied that it did. 38
Since headquarters allowed units latitude in expending their allotments, the
one third unit-of-fire restriction resulted in some creative bookkeeping by field
commanders. On July 1, for example, the commanding general of the First
Inanty Division requested permission
to allocate his
one-third unit-of-fire
vitin his division. He wanted to give one unit-of-fire of 81 mm mortar shells
lo the Twenty-sixth Infantry Regiment, but none to tank destroyer, armored,
field artillery, and other corps units.
They worked out a similar arrangement
for 60 mm mortars later in the day.?9
When the Second Armored Division
sougnt permission the next day to expend 60 mm and 81 mm mortar shells, its
GA received authorization to expend one unit-of-fire of each during that day as
ong as the number of shells expended by the entire corps did not exceed the
we third unit of fire limit, but if it did, the corps ordnance officer was to notify
the corps G-4 immediately. 40
As a result, the corps' units had to inform the
cops arillery officer of every expenditure so he could ensure that the total
corps expenditures did not exceed authorized levels.
Thus,
an accountant's
nightmare developed.
With the supply system apparently recovered enough to remove restrictions
on atillery ammunition expenditures,
on July
4, V Corps lifted the one-third
UF restrictions on all types of ammunition and substituted an expenditure table
which stated that weapons could expend unlimited quantities of ammunition on
the first day of an attack, one-half U/F on subsequent days of an attack, and
one-third U/F on normal days.
Since these limits applied on a corps basis, each
cops had some flexibility in distributing its allocation.
As any expenditures
exceeding these levels had to be explained within twenty-four hours, justifying
ammunition expenditures to corps artillery headquarters became a common
occurrence for division G-4s.41
V Corps Headquarters made it clear in their
order to end rationing that the ammunition situation remained critical and that
rationing could be reinstituted at any time.
Headquarters informed all V Corps
units that
experience in campaign to date indicates a tendency to utilize artillery fire on targets
which should be engaged by infantry small arms and or supporting weapons.
It is
directed that all units be impressed with the importance of expending ammunition only
on targets which are renumerative and are beyond the capabilities of other weapons.
If this princinle is adhered to there will be available at all times sufficient ammunition
of all types to meet the requirements of all fire missions. *2
Despite the increased use of ammunition allowed by the new expenditure
table, units continued to fire more ammunition than authorized. The V Corps
ammunition officer reported that on July 5 the Second Armored Division had
fired 1,953 105 mm shells over the one-third UF authorized by the expenditure
table, just a day after the new limits went into effect. Because the overage did
not push total corps expenditures over authorized levels, the corps escaped
