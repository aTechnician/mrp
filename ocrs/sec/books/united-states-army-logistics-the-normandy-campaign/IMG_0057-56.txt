censure by FUSA; however, corps headquarters notified Second Armored
Division Headquarters that they owed a written justification for the overage. 43
The
next day, First
Infantry
Division
received
notification
from corps
headquarters that it had exceeded its allocation.
They had fired 772 rounds of
105 mm, 172 rounds over the limit.
Fortunately, like the day before, this
overage tell short of the one-third U/F allowance for the entire corps. 44
Ammunition shortages extended to all types of ordnance.
On July 8 the
FUSA chemical section limited 4.2-inch chemical mortar expenditures to one-
third U/ a day, a mere twenty rounds per tube per day, until further notice. is
The next day FUSA placed limits on the expenditure of all calibers of white
phosphorus shells 46 Combat units found that white phosphorus (WP) had "an
extremely high demoralizing effect on enemy troops
"and as a result nearly
depleted the army reserve.47
FUSA ordered army supply points to limit WP
issues to 2 percent of high explosive shells on each requisition.*
Disputes arose between combat units and corps headquarters regarding the
expenditure of ammunition.
A case involving the Second Infantry Division
illustrates the problems encountered.
The V Corps ordnance officer informed
the Second Infantry Division that its three attached 4.2-inch mortar companies
had fired 2,527 rounds over their allocation from July 8 to July 13. When the
division G-4 cited authorization from the General Bradley to fire one U/F on
July 11, V Corps Headquarters asked that a copy be sent to the corps ordnance
officer. When Second Division got the situation cleared up on July 15, it
turned out that the July 11 expenditure of ammunition had been authorized,
since the division had built up a credit balance of mortar shells by not expending
their daily allotment. Even with the July 11 expenditure, the division still had
a 1,268-round credit balance as of July 13.50
Therefore, the division had
actually fired less then their allotment for the period, mot more as corps
headquarters had charged.
Clearly a corps bookeeping error, this case illustrates the chaotic nature of
the rationing system. As tons of supplies poured across the beach and as
ADSEC personnel haphazardly filled supply dumps throughout Normandy,
inventory control became nearly impossible. While moving thousands of shells
through the system each day, FUSA and its corps tried to keep track of every
shell expended by maintaining accounts for each unit.
balance could exceed daily allotments.
Units with a credit
requisitions and expenditures, it also had to take into account whether a unit had
"banked" unexpended allotments.
Thus, as bookkeeping dealt with
Such bookkeeping only complicated matters as the ammunition situation
became critical in mid-July. After a July 12 fire at the main ammunition dump,
Depot 101, initial estimates concluded that the fire destroyed 5,000 tons of
ammunition. Actual losses included 1,000 tons of serviceable and five hundred
tons of unserviceable ammunition."
The July 15 V Corps G-4 Operations
Journal contained no ammunition situation report, just a notation that losses
resulting from the fire had not yet been determined 52
That losses at the depot

remained unclear for several days further compounded inventory
control
difficulties.
The ammunition dump fire, increased ammunition requirements related to
the heavy fighting around St. Lô, and the need to build up reserves for
Operation COBRA, and the impending breakout all placed enormous pressure
on he ammunition supply system.53
As of July 14, reports indicated 1.8 units
ofire of 81 mm mortar shells on hand with one liberty ship containing 71,000
rounds expected shortly, which sailed from the United Kingdom on July 11, but
acording to Advance Section personnel, had not yet arrived three days later.
COMZ indicated that only 2,000 rounds of light and 12,000 rounds of heavy 81
mn mortar rounds remained in the United Kingdom. 54
The mortar shell situation became so serious in mid-July that the FUSA
began listing the supply of 81 mm mortar shells by type, light, heavy, and
smoke, in the daily report.
Previously all had been lumped together under the
mortar category. On July 15, General Bradley ordered the First, Fourth, Ninth,
Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth,
Thirty-fifth, and Eighty-third Infantry and the Third
Armored Divisions to limit the use of 81 mm mortar ammunition, stocks of
which bottomed out at .3 U/F on July 17.35
As a result FUSA restricted the
allocation of shells for the period July 15 to 18 (see Table 4-2).
The next day,
July 16, the commanding general of the Second Armored Division received
excessive use of field artillery ammunition from V Corps Headquarters, with the
clarification that "conservation of ammunition is essential.
It will be expended
