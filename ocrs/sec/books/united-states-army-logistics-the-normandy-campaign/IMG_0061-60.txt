Although the shortage of Class Il and IV items, especially quartermaster,
engineer, and signal equipment, which developed in mid-July did not materially
affect the course of the campaign in Normandy, those shortfalls proved
significant in that they only got worse over time.
The causes of the shortages
that developed during the Normandy operation were only intensified by the
breakout and pursuit across France, the arrival of the Americans at the German
Siegfried Line, and the approaching winter.
As planners requisitioned Class II
and IV items months in advance, time remained the only long-term solution to
the supply problem.
The supply shortages confronted by the First United States Army, whether
Class I, Il and IV, III, or V, all created problems of one kind or another for the
logistics personnel. The ordnance scarcity led to improvisation.

estimates and questionable inventory figures as tools.

fighting and the resulting shortages.?6
advance across France left most of the hedgerow-related problems behind, but
the pursuit would generate a new array of supply difficulties.
