only on renumerative targets. "S6
As ammunition use increased dramatically
between July 6 and July 15, FUSA reserves fell at a rate of .2 U/F per day, a
depletion rate that could not continue indefinitely.
During this peak period,
units expended more ammunition than at any other time in the Normandy
campaign. FUSA's July 15 reserve ammunition levels are detailed in Table
4-3.
As reserves fell, General Bradley, the FUSA commanding general, faced
with escalating expenditures of ammunition, supply uncertainties, and expected
future demands, ordered rationing to resume.
He reinstituted expenditure limits
to build up artillery reserves to seven U/Es within thirty days, while allowing
sufficient ammunition for tactical operations.
As with expenditures, FUSA
bookkeeping with regard to ammunition stocks on hand became extremely
creative.
The FUSA calculation of reserves not only included the number of

rounds supposedly in ammunition depots, it also counted ammunition supposedly
on ships bound for the Continent.
Considering the chaos in the supply dumps,
the lack of manifests for many ships, and unloading delays offshore, FUSA
reserve figures were highly dubious at best.
The lack of precise information
may have led planners to conclude that a critical shortage of ammunition existed
when ample ammunition actually lay in dumps, but lost within the system.$8
In the continuing effort to end hoarding,
Major General William B.
Kean,
the FUSA chief of staff, ordered the V Corps' commanding general to inform
all his units that to possess more than a basic load of ammunition without the
permission of the FUSA commanding general was forbidden. FUSA prohibited
units from drawing more ammunition until they expended all ammunition in
excess of their basic loads.") Although various headquarters periodically warned
subordinate units not to possess excess ammunition,
hoarding remained a
problem.
FUSA established further expenditure limits in preparing for the upcoming
Operation COBRA.
The ordnance section reported in the July 17 V Corps G-4
Operations Journal that the artillery and mortar ammunition situation remained
so critical that no figures could be obtained regarding these types for the daily
journal. FUSA established a Table of Authorized Ammunition Expenditures
for V Corps for the period 0600 July 18 to 0600 of D +1, July 26, of the
forthcoming operation (see Table 4-4).
During that time, FUSA authorized V
Corps to expend 500 rounds of 4.2-inch high explosive,
