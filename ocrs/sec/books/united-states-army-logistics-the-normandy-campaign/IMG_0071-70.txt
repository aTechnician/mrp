organizations or "unforeseeable" events for the supply problems in Europe, for
example, channel storms, Normandy hedges, and delays in capturing ports.
Lee's defense of COMZ accomplishments stressed,
We should record at more length the difficulties of planning with commanders who do
not clearly know or who underestimate their missions' requirements. We were pressed
from the beginning by General Somervell for our likely and final requirements.
These
had to be obtained from the Allied Commander and his American subordinates. Where
the figures were not available, we had to make the best guess possible."
Lord took the argument a step further, admitting that
all advance planning estimates (relating to port availability and capacities] were over-
optimistic
beyond anything which was anticipated. "7o
Thus the essential argument became, COMZ did exceptionally well considering
nothing went according to plan, and victory made such an argument plausible
to many.
Such questions as why plans changed, projections failed, and
schedules did not hold up were lost in the shuffle.
Lee concluded that the
administrative support of the field forces was "on the whole, successful. "7I As
during the Great War, the U.S. Army logistical system in World War II
performed at a level sufficient to ensure the defeat of Germany.
Thus the
supply personnel are to be commended for doing their part, had they failed to
perform as they did the war could have very well been prolonged. Conversely,
had the supply organization been simplified, less bureaucratically overwhelming,
and better prepared to support the forces in Normandy and during the breakout
with the supplies they needed, the war might very well have been shortened.
