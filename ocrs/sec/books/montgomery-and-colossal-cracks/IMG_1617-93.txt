Crerar and the First Canadian Army
This chapter examines the contribution made by the First Canadian Army to the
manner in which the 21st Army Group conducted the Northwest Europe
campaign. This army was commanded by Lieutenant-General -from November
1944, General -Henry D. G. Crerar.
To recapitulate, the contribution made at
army level to the operational approach of the 21st Army Group was determined
by the following: the functions of an army; the relationship between army group
and army; and the extent to which army group operational methods were
implemented at the level of army.
The last two of these aspects are now
examined with regard to Crerar's First Canadian Army.
CRERAR'S OPERATIONAL APPROACH
This analysis briefly explores, within the context of an army's operational
functions, Crerar's operational approach in Northwest Europe
Three factors
ensured that in this campaign Crerar's operational methods mirrored those of
Montgomery: The latter was determined to disseminate his methods; Crerar had
alreado been inculcated with Montgomery's approach back in 1942 as the latter s
subordinate in Southeastern Command; and the British army had developed a
broad doctrinal consensus from its experiences in the western desert!
The
operational style of General Crerar and the First Canadian Army are now
examined using the same categorization that was used earlier to analyze
Montgomery's and Dempsey's approaches.
Crerar's operational methods, like Montgomery's, displayed strong concern
to maintain the morale of his troops.
His own cautious approach mirrored
Montgomery's fears that setbacks would have an adverse impact on troop
morale.
For example, on 13 September 1944 Crerar told Montgomery of his
concern that the morale boost gained by the recent rapid success at Le Havre
"should not be more than lost by an unsuccessful attack on the next objective,
