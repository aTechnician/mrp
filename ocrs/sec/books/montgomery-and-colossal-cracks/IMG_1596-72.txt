"Colossal Cracks" II: The Other Elements
Having examined those key tenets of Montgomery's "Colossal Cracks" tech-
nique that comprised the crux of his physical conduct of set-piece operations,
this chapter analyzes the other four fundamental components of his operational
technique: maintenance of the initiative, balance, administration, and air power.
This study then examines the following seven ancillary characteristics that
comprised the remaining components of Montgomery's operational technique:
grip, flank protection, surprise, flexibility, cooperation, simplicity, and the
assimilation of the lessons of combat experience.
THE OTHER FUNDAMENTALS OF "COLOSSAL CRACKS"
A key concept in Montgomery's operational approach was the classic mili-
tary principle of the initiative —imposing your will on the enemy.
The Field
Marshal believed that the events of the 1939-45 war demonstrated that the
achievement and maintenance of the initiative over the enemy in combat had
become essential to victory.
Montgomery meant by the initiative that a
commander had to "make the battle swing [his] way" and "make the enemy
dance to his tune from the beginning, and never vice versa.
I To maintain the
initiative a commander had to "continue relentlessly with his own plan." To be
able to do this, his dispositions had to be "so balanced" that he "need not react to
the enemy's move."
Put simply, it was crucial for a commander to position
appropriately his readied reserves to block swiftly previously anticipated enemy
countermoves before they achieved any degree of tactical success?
Hence to
Montgomery the initiative meant that a commander had to ensure that opera-
tions developed according to a predetermined plan.
Such actions would force
the enemy merely to react, rather than be able to instigate their own measures.
A force that successfully undertook offensive action and maintained a grip on
the initiative accrued distinct moral advantages, and Montgomery hoped that
