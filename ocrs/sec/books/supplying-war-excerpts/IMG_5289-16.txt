a revolution in warfare. For Louis XIV's war against the Dutchi

mobilized from all over Westen
Europe. The approach to Holland from the south being barre
by row after row of river fortresses, it was decided to launch the
invasion from the east through Guelderland. The army was to be
kept supplied from a chain of magazines established in advanc
on the territory of France's ally, the Elector of Cologne, who ea
marked four of his towns - Neuss, Kaiserswerth,
Dorsten - for the purpose. The next step was to send agents into
Cologne who, while ostensibly working for the Elector, were to
have those magazines filled. The principle followed throughout -
one that may sound strange in these days of 'export or die ' - s
to procure from one's own country only that which could not be
got at abroad. In this particular case it was necessary to bring up
the artillery from France, but everything else was acquired out-
side her own frontiers. The powder and ammunition even came
from Amsterdam by means of the good offices of a Jewish banker
there, Sadoc. At the same time, France's own magazines along bet
northern frontier were also filled.
The campaign proper opened on 9 May. Turenne with 23,00
men and 30 guns left his camp at Châtelet (near Charleroi) and
marched down the Sambre. Taking Tongres and Bilsen on his
way, he reached Maestricht and invested it. At this point he was
joined by Conde's Army of the Ardennes which had come march

left, both marching north along the opposite banks until re-united
at Emmerich on 11 June. The Rhine was crossed on 12 June and it
was now that the war began in earnest. In just one week the
French had reached Amersfoort, sixty miles from Emmerich and
perhaps twenty from Amsterdam. At this point the Dutch opened
their dykes and, in face of the rising water, the campaign came

spite of these exceptionally favourable circumstances it did not
cover more than about 220 miles in thirty-three days, averaging
under seven miles a day in what was to be the most mobile of all
the campaigns of Louis XIV. It was not until enemy territory was
reached that performances somewhat improved, aided by the fact
that distances were short and opposition almost nonexistent. It
was, to be sure, a highly successful campaign, but one perhaps
more marked by the thoroughness of its organization than by any
extraordinary mobility.
Coming now to the limitations of the system, it is important
above all to keep in mind how incomplete it was.
method, indeed the very aim of warfare in this period was to live
at the enemy's expense. As Louvois himself put it in a standard
formula that he used whenever informing his intendants with the
army of a forthcoming campaign,
'His Majesty has...a consider-
able army assembled.. in order to enter the lands of His Catholic
Majesty and live at their cost until the governor of the Catholic
Low Countries will give in to his demands...[the intendant] will
be responsible for making the Spanish lands pay the taxes that
will be imposed on them.'3 Even when it was Louvois' express
intention to 'avoid burdening the country', fodder was one com-
modity that had to be taken away from it on practically every
occasion. 35 Usually, however, there was no room for such niceties.
French commanders were instructed to live off what you can
find on the way' even when it was only a question of making a
relatively short flank march, and to this purpose were authorized
to use means every bit as ferocious as those employed by Wallen-
stein, including the destruction of houses and the seizure of men,
beasts and movables. Even in the early phase of a campaign,
when part at least of the army's demand had to be met from a
