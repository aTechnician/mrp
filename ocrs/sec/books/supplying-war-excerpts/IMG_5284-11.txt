writing to his chancellor, Oxenstierna,
Werben:
from the camp at
'we have often informed you of our conditions, i.e. that
we and the Army are living in great poverty, difficulty and dis
order, all our servants having left us, and we are compelled to
wage war by ruining and destroying all our neighbours. It is so
at this very moment, for we have nothing left to satisfy the men
except for what they can rob and plunder..
And in another
letter:
'regardless of your own proposal, Mr. Chancellor, to send
us 100,000 thalers a month.. the Army has not received one penny
for the last sixteen weeks.. to feed our men we have had only
such bread as we could squeeze from the towns, but there is a
limit even to that. It has been impossible to restrain the horsemen
...who live simply
from
wild plunder. Everything has been
ruined thereby, so that nothing more can be found for the soldiers
in towns or villages.'? It was, to be sure, high time for the army
to expand its
'base' area once again. In September, the way for
this was opened by the signal victory at Breitenfeld.
Having defeated Tilly,
two courses were once again open to
Gustavus Adolphus. He could continue his way along the Oder;
strategically this might have been the logical thing to do, for
down to the southeast lay the centre of his enemies' power,
Vienna. Alternatively, he might advance to the Rhine. This
second route promised better going for the artillery.22 What was
more, it would carry the Swedes into the richest part of Germany
instead of the bleak mountains of Bohemia. The upshot was that,

taken possession of the greater part of central Germany.
ever its other merits, the decision had certainly justified itself in
terms of the army's material state down to its very appearance.
Almost overnight, the crowd of beggars infesting Brandenburg
and Saxony had been turned into a rich, well-appointed force."
This, of course, was achieved by thoroughly squeezing the towns
on the way, priests and Jews everywhere being made to pay an
extra contribution.
The winter of 1631-2 was spent in the general area of
Würzburg-Frankfurt-Mainz. By this time, Gustavus Adolphus
had under his command over one hundred thousand men. In pre
paration for the next campaign, he hoped to double that number.
Even though his troops were now able to draw on the resources
of half Germany, however, it was clear that no such enormous
