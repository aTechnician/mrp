PREFACE
This study owes its existence to a book, The Blitzkrieg Era and
the German General Staff, 1865-1941, by Larry H. Addington,
which first excited my interest in logistics. Professor Addington
has also kindly answered some queries, as did Mr David Chandler
Christopher Duffy, both of the
Department of Mili-
tary History, Sandhurst. I owe a debt of gratitude to Professor
Laurence Martin and Mr Brian Bond, of King's College, London,
for aid and encouragement. Material for Chapter 7 was made
available on behalf of the Liddell Hart Centre for Military
Archives by Lady Kathleen Liddell Hart, for whose kind hos-
pitality I am most grateful. Some financial support during my
stay in London came from the British Council.
Above all, however, I thank Rachel my wife; it was she who
typed out some of the chapters, and suffered for the rest.
