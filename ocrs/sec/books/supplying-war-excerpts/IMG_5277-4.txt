INTRODUCTION
Logistics are defined by Jomini as 'the practical art of moving
armies' under which he also includes providing for the successive
arrival of convoys of supplies' and 'establishing and organizing...
lines of supplies' 1 Putting these together, one arrives at a defini-
tion of logistics as 'the practical art of moving armies and keeping
them supplied', in which sense the term is used in this study. The
aim of the study is to arrive at an understanding of the problems
involved in moving and supplying armies as affected through time
by changes in technology, organization and other relevant factors;
and, above all, to investigate the effect of logistics upon strategy
during the last centuries.
Strategy, like politics, is said to be the art of the possible; but
surely what is possible is determined not merely by numerical
strengths, doctrine, intelligence, arms and tactics, but, in the first
place, by the hardest facts of all: those concerning requirements,
supplies available and expected, organization and administration,
transportation and arteries of communication. Before a comman-
der can even start thinking of manoeuvring or giving battle, of
marching this way and that, of penetrating, enveloping, encirc-
ling, of annihilating or wearing down, in short of putting into
practice the whole rigmarole of strategy, he has - or ought - to
make sure of his ability to supply his soldiers with those 3,000
calories a day without which they will very soon cease to be of
any use as soldiers; that roads to carry them to the right place at
the right time are available, and that movement along these roads
will not be impeded by either a shortage or a superabundance of
transport.
It may be that this requires, not any great strategic genius but
only plain hard work and cold calculation. While
