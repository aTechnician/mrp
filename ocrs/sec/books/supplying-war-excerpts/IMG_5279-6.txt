The background of two centuries
The tyranny of plunder
The period from 1560 to 1660 has been described as 'the military
and as such was characterized above all by the im-
mense growth in the size of Europe's armies. Marching to suppress
the revolt of the Netherlands in 1567, the Duke of Alba made a
tremendous impression by taking along just three tercios of 3,000
men each, plus 1,600 cavalry; a few decades later, the Spanish
'Army of Flanders' could be counted in tens of thousands.' The
most important engagements of the French Huguenot wars during
the latter half of the sixteenth century were fought with perhaps
10,000-15,000 men on each side, but during the Thirty Years War
battles between French, Imperial and Swedish armies number-
ing 30,000 men and more were not uncommon.
At the peak of
their military effort in 1631-2, Gustavus Adolphus and Wallen-
stein each commanded armies totalling far in excess of 100,000
men. Such numbers could not be sustained during the later stages
of the Thirty Years War, but growth continued after about 1660.
At Rocroi in 1643, the largest power of the time - Imperial Spain -
was decisively defeated by just 22,000 French troops, but thirty
years later Louis XIV mobilized 120,000 to deal with the Dutch.
Even in peacetime under his reign, the French Army seldom fell
below 150,000 men, that of the Habsburgs being only slightly
smaller, numbering perhaps 140,000. The war establishment of
both forces was much larger still, the French one reaching 400,000
during the years of peak military effort from 1691 to 1693. In 1709,
it was already possible for 80,000 Frenchmen to meet 110,000
Allied troops on the battlefield of Malplaquet. More and better
statistics could be adduced, but they would only serve to prove
what is generally recognized: namely, that apart from a period of
about twenty-five years between 1635 and 1660, Europe's armies
