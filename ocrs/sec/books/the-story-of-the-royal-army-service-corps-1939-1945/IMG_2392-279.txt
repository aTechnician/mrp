THE RASC, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
The standing committee which had recommended the adoption
of the tin,
The Standing Committee on the Method of Delivery and Dis
tribution of Petrol in Front of Railhead', had made it clear that although
supply by tine filled at home would have to be the sole means of
distribution in the first phase, they foresaw a second phase when
supply would be partly in tins and partly in bulk
particularly for
whation spirit. A third phase would follow when all supply would
be in bulk and tin making and filling plants would be established
in the theatre of war,
It was obrious to OMG 6 before the war that a new organization,
separated from food supply, would be needed to develop supply in
the second and third phases and that all other theatres of war would
eventually have to be provided with a similar organization,
lack of time, manpower and money prevented any action from being
taken to that end in peacetime,
The most that OMG 6 could do
was to plan the type of petroleum units which would probably be
wanted,
However, it only took a few weeks of war before simultaneous
action was taken to initiate the second phase of supply and to
chain agreement to the addition of 'petroleum' an a separate branch
d the Corye many activities,
The fient requisite was to form a petroleum branch at the Wat
Office, It was staffed by the three officers of OMG 6 who dealt
with petrol, and was named OMG 17 until it was redesignated as
ST a later in the war,
A small staff headed by Mr Puller of the
MOC, who was hasily commisioned for the purgene, was provided
fen the BEN,
By the combined efforts of there two new branches an
appreciation of the petrel situation in France and recommendations

The plan advocated that evil bulk surage should be taken over at
Honteir and le Have, a port which had been excluded from the

attack, Details of the methods of reduen fire risks were inested
in the appreciation.
It was veggested that the evil installation at

that new filling contes should be established further forward on the

of cans which would be required, and the principle of bringing
petrol in bulk to mobile filling points close behind the forward
troops had still to be accepted,
A total of 1,290,000 returnable cans
were, however, shipped to rance between January and May, 1940,
from orders placed in 1935, for 1,800,000, on three firms who normally
specialized on making, motorcar bodies,
Even so the BEV had to
continue to make extensive use of the A gallon tin to maintain
There was no delay in setting the organization (establishments)
of the new petroleum unite required and the first unit, a bulk petrol
Morage company, was in Vrance by December, 1990, and followed
shortly after by another,
Two base petrol filling centres were
formed and were in France by carly 1940,
They were static unite
and wete equipped with heavy plant which necesitated a gond dent

Mobile
petrol filing centres were introduced later in the war,
Petrol
depots, formed from the No, 5, Section of base supply depots, were
organived for holding packed reserves of spint and other fuels and
