THE RASC. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
English Chanel, Its place was taken by operation 'Orelob', a
reversal involving the handing over of establishments by the United
States army to the British,
There were still certain establishments
retained for depot use by our Allies, England being used not only
as an air base but also as a staging point in the reinforcement of
American formations on the Continent and as a base for the recep-
tion of American sick and wounded from Europe.
But a steady return of camps and depots of all sorts was in progress
from the last months of 1944 onwards.
Several legacies tame to
the British Army in the way of former American hospitals and
camps of semi-permanent construction and of mote lavish lay-out
thân out 6wh:
These formed welcome additions to the Army's
post-wat accommodation.
Finally, with the overthrow of the last of our enemies, Japan,
and the setting up oh occupation forces in Germany, Austria,
Venetia Giulia and Japan, the RASC establishments were every
where severely cut and, in Germany, transport compaties adminis
tered by the RASC but manned almost wholly by our late enemies
(albeit reduced to the status of civilians) and supply and petrol
depots similarly 'Eviliatived came into being.
The wheel had
come full citele, but this time, thanks to our occupation forces and
to our overseas cottitments, and thanks to the need to bé on out
zuard against Communist astression, the Corps was not crippled
by such drastic cats as in 161G.

Flaming for War
Between the Murich crisis and the outbreak of war, the ondering
of vehicles and equigment from evil industry for the RASC formed
& large part of the work of the transport branch at the Wat Office,
The ta monthet grace proved to be barely encrugh to obtain
all the material wanted, but it was sufficient to equip the RASC
mits of the field force adequately:
Wat the hid fence wee wat end of August, and it was only *
question of receiving the code word for mobilization to tise,
morent & notice, the assets available, and to set the mobiliation
machinery into thotion.
The code word for general motivation,
which was to be despatched to all commands at hete and abroad,
was Wait,
At that time there was & staff officer called Captain
Haig in the Quartering Directorate, and an amusing situation (on

The ambiguity of this reply was luckily detected in time to prevent
the British Army from going to war too early
When the order was issued, the success of the venture depended
largely on the ability of the War Office to provide units with
their vehicles, particularly their technical ones:
The load car vin
vehicles were to be obtained by impreming civil vehicles.
Technical
vehicles such as workshops and stores torties and ambulances were
& different problem because they had to be found from the geton and
3o-owt, load vatrying six wheeled vehicles operated by kASCicom
panies in peace and converted for such purposes when war came.
All unite holdings had to be despatched to the Heavy Kepait
Shớp at Felthat, where normal overhad programmes were swept
aside and the whole of the shop was devoted to this great task
Most of the a ton six-wheeled vehietes had to be fitted with workshop
machinery, breakdown lorry equipment, or MiT steres bins from
the stock which had been built up and held in the M'T Stores bepet.
There were many other specialist vehietes, such as hygiene and
bacteriological laboratories and brideng vehicles, Which retoni
tated the removal of the load carrhine body and is complete
replacement bry a techreat body.
The layonut oh the Fits precided
