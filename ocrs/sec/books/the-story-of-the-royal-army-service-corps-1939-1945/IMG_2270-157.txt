the mainland, and some of the formations due to take part in it,
such as the 5th Division and Ist Canadian Division, were still
awaiting the balance of their transport and equipment, which was
not due to arrive until some weeks after the assault was to take place.
The plan for the assault involved three operations: 'Baytown', an
assault across the straits of Messina on September 3rd, which was
to be effected by
XIII
Corps with
5th
British
and the Ist
Canadian Divisions; 'Avalanche', the assault on Salerno on Septem-
ber gth, which was to be undertaken by the American Fifth Army,
which included X British Corps, with 46th and 56th Divisions
and the 7th Armoured Division under command; and 'Slapstick',
which was to be directed against Taranto on the evening of Septem-
ber gth by V
Corps,
which
was
allotted
the
Ist Airborne
Division, the 78th Division, and the 8th Indian Division for the
purpose.
Other formations, which were to be available if required, were
the Ist Division, 2nd New Zealand Division and the 25th Tank
Brigade.
The general direction of the campaign was the responsibility of
the Supreme Allied Commander, at that time General Eisenhower
whose headquarters,
Allied Force Headquarters, was located at
Algiers. General Alexander, whose headquarters was the HQ
15 Army Group, was responsible for the conduct of operations, his
two armies the Eighth (British) and Fifth (American) being com-
manded by General Montgomery
and
General Mark
Clark
respectively.
Initially HQ 15 Army Group was relieved of responsibility for
administration
and maintenance,
a special
headquarters,
advanced administrative echelon of the AFHQ,
called Flambo,
being provided for the purpose.
The provision of the requirements
of the force was undertaken by the main Allied headquarters which
remained at Algiers until May, 1914, when it was moved to the
Royal Palace at Caserta, near Naples.
Some time after the armies were established on the mainland,
HQ 15 Army Group was renamed HQ Allied Central Mediter-
ranean Forces, and the Flambo organization was incorporated into
it, thus reverting to the normal organization whereby operations
and administration are controlled by the same headquarters.
little later the name of the headquarters was changed again, to
HQ Allied Armies in Italy.
As AFHQ did not maye to Italy until May, 1944, the brunt of
the task of building no he RASC organization in Italy fell on
