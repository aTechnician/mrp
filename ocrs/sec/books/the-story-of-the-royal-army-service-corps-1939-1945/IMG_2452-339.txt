THE R.A.SC, FIRET
A similar reconnaimance was successfully completed on the Lewer
or Láttle Scarcies,
Lack of Buropeans and the very real maintenance difficulties
increasingly took their toll as the months went on, and in 1943 the
whole of the water transport requirements were reviewed,
In
consequence 793 Water Transport Company, WAASC, was formed
to replace the existing services,
It had its headguarters at Freetown
and a section in each of the four colonies. As there are no docking
facilities for large ships at Bathurst in the Gambia, four launches
were stationed there and used for embarkation and for ferrying
men across the River Gambia, They were also used for the
transport of cattle from the interior, and even target towing,
As Freetown is another port where large whips cannot berth, the
importance of our craft for embarkation and disembarkation needs
no emphasis,
That task therefore continued, and similar work was
done at Takoradi in the Gold Coast.
The Nigerian section of the Water Transport Company operated
in Lagps Harbour and lagoon, which extends parallel to the coast
for some 5p miles, The section ran a ferry service from Lagos
proper (which is an island) to Apapa on the mainland opposite,
where the main supply depot was situated,
It also ran a service
and ferried drinking water to the Fire Service command battery
at Tarquah, and later was engaged for some time on the dumping
of ammunition in the sea,
Fast Afrea
The RASC Fleet in Fast Africa Command has no epie tales to
tell, but rather a record of steady achievement and tremendously
hard training and work,
No RASC craft were stationed there before
the war, and although alter the war began a few local craft were
operated by various formations and units to ferry men, it was not
until May, 1943, that the service really got going,
Some 15 vessels
were then transerted to RASC charge, most of them in poor condi-
tion. Many boats were requisitioned both for training and for
service until delivery could be effected of motor fishing vessels from
Bouth Africa and fast launches and harbour craft from England.
A training cadre was sent out from
the United Kingdom to
train the natives, and by 1944 510 Company, BAASC (water
transport) was well established,

Corps were drafted to the unit and tried out. Training was rapid
and intensive.
Some of the initial trainees proved unsuitable and
had to be replaced with special recruits from the coast and lake
districts of East Africa,
Yet the askaris soon became enthusiastic,
and their greatest ambition was to win the sailor's cap issued to
each man when he passed his proficiency tests.
This was a real
triumph for the Luo native from the lake district of Kenya.
One
of the greatest difficulties was the teaching of the tides, another was
the language problem; for all commands were given in English.
Workshop personnel were also trained, and so successful was the
instruction, both in workshops and on the water, that many big
African business concerns, as well as Government harbour depart-
ments, arranged to employ the EAASC water transport askaris on
their discharge from the Army,
One of the company's best efforts was the voyage, unescorted, of
four s6-ton motor fishing vessels from Mombasa right the way
through to Alexandria, where they were needed for urgent transport
work a distance of 3,000 miles.
Their route was via Mogadishu,
Dante, round Cape
Guardafui, Aden, Port Sudan, Port Suez,
and thence to Alexandria.
The voyage took 24 days, and enough
food, water and fuel was taken on board at Mombasa for the
whole trip.
"Nil sine labore was indeed a reality to this unit,

The Caribbean
Throughout the war, RASC vessels operated in both the North
and South Caribbean,
For most of the period, they were controlled
ay the officers commanding RASC, but in July, 1944, No, 899
Company, RASC (water transport) was raised to operate all Fleet
craft in the northern waters.
Based on Jamaica, it had for its near neighbours the Naval, Air
Force and loyal Artillery establishments at Kingston harbour,
Its most interesting task was the long distance passenger and cargo
run between Kingston and Belize, a distance of some 650 miles,
For this service a 250-ton American Fleet auxiliary, re-named the
RASCY Catania, was obtained under the lease-lend agreement,
A RASC Fleet civilian crew cook delivery of her at Boston and
sailed her to Jamaica,
She also made several voyages between her
home port of Kinaicon and British Honduras, Nassau in the Bahamas
and Turks Island,
On one occasion, in the middle of the Caribbean
Sea, the cook went mad (perhaps because of the heat of the galley)
