CHAPTER V
THE MIDDLE EAST II
GREECE, 1941
Tis not with very cheerful feelings that one sets out to try to
describe the part played by the RASC in the brief campaign in
Creece in early
1641,

Whatever benefits may have been
looked upon from the broades
aspect, by British intervention in Greece
and that is a matter th
which there can be more than one opinion
there can be no doubt
about its catastrophie effects on the unfortunate
Dominion at
British troops involved,
In this the RASC and its allied Corpo
were no exception.
It has been calculated, probably with reas
able accuracy, that of the 1y8 officers, 4.424 other ranks and som
2,700 vehicles of the RASC to land in Greece, 75 officers, 2pt)
other ranks and not one vehicle returned eventually to Bay,
Losses in men, therefore, exceeded one half in the RASC alone al
were presumably equally heavy in the AASC and NZASC,
The first British troops to be sent to Greece consisted of a smal
RAP detachment, and to maintain it a small supply depot wit
established near Athens, The despatch of further British loret
began in early March.
By April 6th the Germans had erossed the
frontier and the Crecks had been rapidly overcome and driven tack s

Such a short lived campaien, full of incident though it was, fe

to any unit to settle down,

issue depots, one field butchery and cold storage depot, one petrol
depot, one base petrol filling centre, one bulk petrol storage com-
pany, and many
minor
units
and miscellaneous detachments,
including a detachment of 28g Company (L of C (RH)) of 10-ton
lorries,
The force was thus well provided with RASC units, few of
which however got into their stride in their proper functions,
KASC detachments which accompanied the early RAF party
included aga Company and the detachment of 28s Company, as
well as a few ambulances.
DDST to the force arrived on March grd.
Before his arrival a CRASC had been attached to the RAY HQ
Most of the remainder of the force headquarters arrived after the
DDST, so that it was some time before a firm maintenance plan was
available,
However, it eventually became clear that the line
which there might be some prospect of holding was what was known
as the Aliakmon position, running from the Aegean Sea and Mount
Olympus to Edhema on the Yugoslay frontier,
co-operation with the Greek equivalent of supplies and transport
apparently did not arises they had none worth speaking of.
base area was to be in the Athens area using the port of Piraeus,
It has been mentioned above that a smali supply depot had been
established at Athens to maintain the RAFs actually it was on the
race-course. Supplies from Egypt for the maintenance
of the
whole force and for building up a reserve now began to arrive in
carly March in such quantities that this depot was overwhelmed
and quite incapable of reducing the mass of stuff arriving into any
sort of order.
Matters were not helped by the high proportion of
broken cases usually found in any consignment of supplies moved
by sea in the Middle East.
However, as it had been decided to
establish an advanced base in the Tarisa area, some relief was
effected by consigning stores direct from the docks by rail to that
Unfortunately the only RASC troops
in Larisa were a
placement of aga Company, hardly ideally suited by education or
training to run a supply depot; but they did their best,
the arrival of supply units continued to be behind that of stocks,
the unfortunate outcome of the campaign rendered this of little
eventual importance, but it was trying to tidy-minded ST staff
officers at the actual time.
However, when g1 Base Supply Depot
came along the supply situation was soon in hand and work pro-
ceeded in the establishment and stocking of ISDs within second
