county divisions, apart from the mass of training and administrative
units outside these categoties, in too complex to relate here, nor
indeed is it necemary to do so,
But it was obviously important to
examine the situation to ensure that there was unity of operational
control and that duplication of administrative effort was avoided,
Our readers will be interested to know that the responsibility for,
sorting out by examining the respective administrative responsi
bilities of field formationa, ADCP, areas and sub-areas (into which
commande were divided) in the United Kingdom, having special

Sale, wo was appointed chairman of the committee which bore
his name.
The resultant recommendations went a long way to
