15 Post-D-Day
15.1 Allied casualties on D-Day
If all the British military casualties of the 20th century marched past the
Cenotaph in columns it would take three days and three nights. In the
First World War about three
quarters of a million
British deaths
occurred. ' In the Second World War that number decreased to around
145,000.2 Including all the casualties in all the theatres of war between
1939 and 1945, over 23,000 people died every day. Overall, almost 7
per cent of US forces did not make it through the war unscathed. Two
per cent died in action, 1 per cent died from wounds or disease and 4
per cent were wounded but lived. In contrast, by July 1944 over one
third of the German army had been wounded once, 11 per cent had
been wounded twice and 11 per cent had been wounded three times.
The casualty rate amongst German officers was even greater: on aver-
age cach officer's position was refilled nine times.? Most of these casu-

The Allied planners for D-Day calculated that on D-Day itself the
initial assault divisions would suffer 15 per cent casualties, with the actual
first wave RCTs suffering 25 per cent. Seventy per cent of these would,
they assumed, be wounded, 30 per cent would be dead, missing or
POWs. The follow up divisions would, they assumed, suffer 8 per cent
casualties overall, with the combat regiments taking 15 per cent." By the
end of D-Day the Allies had landed something in the region of 175,000
soldiers® on the beaches and 22,000 inland by air.
Casualty figures are notoriously unreliable: there are no official
German figures for D-Day itself, and of the three main Allied forces only
Canada collected data from individual soldiers. Overall Allied casualties
seem to be somewhere between 8,443 (4.3 per cent) and 10,865 (5.5 per
cent) depending on whose figures are accepted. Roughly one-third of
these were deaths.? Whatever the number it was still far smaller than the
29,500 the planners had assumed.® Churchill had feared 70,000, and the
generally expected number had been half this at around 35,000. In fact
