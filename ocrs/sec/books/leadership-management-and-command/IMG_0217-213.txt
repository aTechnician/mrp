RETROSPECTIVE
SHAEE's secret prediction had been the most accurate at 10,000 dead.
Ambrose estimates that perhaps 10 per cent is a more accurate account. 10
weeks of D-Day the Allies had 20 full divisions in
against the Germans rapidly depleting
18 divisions.11
According to the Official US statistics the 101st Airborne's casualties
were 1,240, including 182 confirmed dead and 501 missing (presumed
captured or killed). The 82nd Airborne's casualties were 1,259 includ-
confirmed dead and 756 missing (presumed captured or
killed). Of the 11,770 troops who fought for the 82nd Airborne
Division for the 33 days it was in action in Normandy (i.e. including
replacements) 46 per cent were casualties, of whom 1,982 were either
killed in action (KIA) or missing in action (MIA); 17 per cent did not
get back to England. 13
The US 4th Infantry Division losses at Utah were put at 197. The
casualties at Omaha for the 4th Division and the 29th Infantry were
approximately 2,000 on the first day and by D-Day +1 between 3,500
and 4,200 were dead, wounded or missing. 14 Within five days the Ist
casualties amounted to 1,373 (656 wounded; 717 dead or missing) for
the same period to 10 June (Hall, 1994: 138).
The 116th RCT of the 29th Division took the highest casualties of any
US regiment in the war. The Division itself took 28,766 casualties in the

242 days it was in the line, a 204 per cent casualty rate. When the 115th
Regiment of the 29th Division was awarded a Distinguished Unit
Citation in March 1945 General Gerhardt wanted each company flag
holder to be a D-Day veteran; six of the 12 companies could not find a
single representative riflemen left. 15 The most significant naval casualties
amongst the US navy were the 46 (13 dead and 33 injured) members of
the Corry sunk by a mine. 16
On Juno Beach the Canadians suffered 805 casualties to add to the
146 suffered inland. There were another 243 casualties in this area from
the British Commando units involved on or near Juno, to bring the total
tor the Juno area to at least 1,204 (and this excludes casualties taken by
the Commando units operating inland). The Canadian 3rd Infantry
Division suffered over 2,800 casualties in the first five days. On 7 June
alone, the Nova Scotia Regiment suffered 242 casualties (84 dead), and
377 casualties were taken in the battle for Carpiquet airport with the
12th SS. On D-Day itself 335 Canadians were killed; most of these are
buried amongst the 2,044 others at the Canadian Cemetery at Bény sur
Mer. There are nine pairs of brothers here and one set or three - the
Westlakes, as well as a father and son (Edward and Alfred Mantle) who
died in the two world wars.17
On Gold Beach itself the British suffered 413 casualties. The Ist
nampshires, who landed on aut anuma a complement of around 600,
lost 231 dead and 1,050 wounded between D-Day and 17 November. In
tect the battalion was wiped out twice.!8 On Sword the beach casualty
figures totalled 630.
The British 6th Airborne Division suffered around 1,500 casualties,
on D-Day and 4,500 in the Normandy campaign as a whole, including
821 dead. 19
Gale's parachute battalion incurred 141 casualties out of
160 participants just in the counter-attack against Breville on 12 June,
while the British 6th Airborne as a whole lost 4,t5/ casualties (1,748
dead or missing and 2,709 wounded).20 The 2,500 members of the Ist
Special Service Brigade of Commandos under Brigadier Lord Lovat
lumed 96 casualties (29 per cent) between D-Day and late August
when it was withdrawn (Oakley, 1994: 248). Of the 87 members of No.
3 Troop, No. 10 Commando on active service, 41 (47 per cent) were
casualties (19 were killed in action, 22 wounded) 21 The 15th Sce rite
Infantry Division lost 2,720 soldiers in six days and half of the rifle
companies were amongst them.?2
Despite Leigh-Mallory's cos, erns, the loss of aircraft carrying the
aurborne forces was relatively low, at about s per cent. The RAF lost
10,000 fighter aircraft in the war and 3,600 pilots, the Us lost 3,/ 39
Plots in Europe and the Mediterranean.
