By the end of June, the 14,634 members of Panzer Lehr had been
reduced by 20 per cent (1,809 wounded and 1,163 dead and missing).49
By 30 June the Germans had 400,000 troops in battle (leaving the
250,000 of the 15th Army still around Calais). By 7 July, Army Group
B had taken 80,783 casualties and received 4,000 replacements. By 6
August Army Group B had taken 144,261 casualties and received
19,914 replacements. In the six weeks from D-Day the Germans lost
250 tanks, which should not have been a major problem since this coin-
cided with the peak of German tank production - but only 17 replace-
ment tanks made it into Normandy in that period, so intense was the
aerial blockade. 50
By the end of the battle for Normandy 25 of the 38 German divi-
sions had been destroyed. Over 1 million soldiers had fought in
German uniforms in Normandy and total German losses, including
POWs, are put at around 450,000 troops (250,000 casualties plus
200,000 POWs or missing), 1,500 tanks, 3,500 artillery pieces and
20,000 vehicles.51
Of the 18,000 strong SS Divisions, the Ist SS had no tanks or guns
left and precious few soldiers; the 2nd SS were a little better off with 450
soldiers and 15 tanks; the 9th SS had 460 soldiers and 25 tanks, the 10th
SS had no tanks and the 12th SS HJ had just 300 soldiers and ten
Only 60 of the German 6th Parachute Regiment's 3,000 soldiers were
still fighting by the end of August 1944. Of the 250 members of the Ist
Company, Ist battalion, 25th Panzergrenadiers that had fought around
Caen on D-Day, only five remained. Within three weeks of D-Day
Panzer Lebr had lost 5,400 soldiers and 160 officers.53
Surprisingly few prisoners were taken in the carly days of Overlord.
The plan had assumed 500 per day for D-Day to D-Day+9 and 1,000 a
day thereafter. In fact, by 26 July, after 56 days of battle, the numbers
were not the assumed 50,000 plus but less than a quarter of this at
12,153. And of these over 90 per cent were ethnic German. By compar-
ison enemy' casualties in Normandy up to 30 June were: 76,996 ethnic
Germans (including 1,830 officers) and 3,787 Russians - over 96 per
cent German. In short, fewer enemy troops surrendered than had been
expected and there scemed little significant difference between the
propensity to surrender between the ethnic Germans and their eastern

15.4 Retrospect
According to Montgomery:
In spite of the enemy's intentions to defeat us on the beaches, we found no
surprises awaiting us in Normandy. Our measures designed to overcome the
defences proved successful. Although not all our D-Day objectives had been
achieved - in particular, the situation at Omaha beach was far from secure - and
in all the beach-head areas there were pockets of enemy resistance, and a very
considerable amount of mopping up remained to be done,
foothold on the Continent of Europe. 55
One particular reason for the high casualties and tardiness of progress
on the ground was that for all the superiority in matériel and numbers
that the Allies could achieve it was rendered less significant against an
enemy that was well dug-in, well armed and prepared to stay-put.
Ironically, then, it was in some respects a rerun of the First World War -
most of the advantages lay with the defender and it seems that only the
ability to win a bloody battle of attrition ensured a victory for the
But success in Normandy was by no means foreordained. Alan Brooke
later accepted that a defeat would have been likely if strong counter-
attacks had been launched at mid-day on the Allied beach-heads -
sommel had been right - but they were not. Partly this was because the
Allied control over the air and over the immediate hinterland prevented
this but it was also the case that the Germans redeployed their own rein-
cement away mom Omaba nos som he time when the situation was crit-
al for the amenicans. similarly, nadethe defenders not moved half their
ammunition back to 'places of safety' they would, perhaps, not have had
to withdraw quite so quickly nor use tracer ammunition that enabled the
invaders to spot them more easily.
And for all the information made available for the assault on the
beaches - and this aspect was markedly successful in general - it was in
sharp contrast to the very problematic information available about the
defences and deployment of defenders off the beaches. Even when the
shes correctly identified theil juaw they almost always underestimated
the skill and tenacity with which these enemies held their ground or
counter-attacked when their ground was lost. for all that Montgomery
was the great planner, the plan really only covered the beaches, after that
there was neither a coherent plan nor were local commanders empowered
to use their initiative because the great planner, allegedly, already had an
infallible plan; it only the Germans had allowed it to unfold.
