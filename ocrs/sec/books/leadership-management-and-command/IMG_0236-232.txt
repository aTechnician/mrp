four regiments - as they had done in the First World War - but the 'square
division' of 22,000 troops was generally regarded as too immobile for
modern warfare and the regular US Army changed to a 'triangular divi-
sion' of 15,500 troops in three regimental formations in late 1941. Each
regiment had three battalions and each battalion had three or four compa-
nies composed of three platoons that themselves had three squads.
Normally, A,B,C, and D Companies were allotted to the Ist battalion; E,F,
G, and H Companies were the 2nd battalion's responsibility; and I, K, L
and M Companies were with the 3rd Battalion (no one seems to know why
J Company was always omitted) (Balkoski, 1999: 95). In March 1942 the
29th Division also moved to a triangular formation when the 176th
Infantry departed (Balkoski, 1999: 24-38).

US officers in Europe received a monthly allowance of alcohol that makes
my consumption levels seemed positively pathetic: two pints of scotch, one
pint of gin, one or two bottles of Cognac, one bottle of Cointreau and one
bottle of Champagne. Several young lieutenants assumed the ration was for
their entire platoon until put straight by letters in the Stars and Stripes
(Linderman, 1997: 200). British sailors were allocated one tot of rum per
day - that was composed of one third of a gill of rum mixed with two parts
water. The drink was known as grog after Admiral Vernon whose nickname
was Grogram after his coat. Being drunk on board ship was still a serious
offence however, so that, for example, on 24 April 1944 a drunken stoker
was arrested and sentenced to six months in jail the following day. Two
days later the stoker was back on board because the jail was full and his
sentence was commuted to six months loss of leave (Maher, 1996: 22,
99-100). Being drunk was also an offence for British soldiers under the
Army Act, as was catching VD and incurring a self inflicted wound (which

is what VD was considered to be) (Lewin, 1998: 39).

51. Frank Sinatra, perhaps the most famous 4-F, was also one of the most
unpopular individuals as far as many combat soldiers were concerned,
though their sisters would probably have disagreed. However, Sinatra
quickly learned that any continuing popularity required him not to play the
hero to the troops and just to sing songs (Linderman, 1997: 317).

"A' Rations comprised 70 per cent fresh food.
'B' Rations added canned single items, such as tomatoes and powdered
Cggs. (By the end of 1941, the dried egg factory in Denison, Texas, was

coffee, jam and the ubiquitous
'SPAM'. In addition C Rations included
toilet paper and cigarettes. The cigarettes were often the Lucky Strike with
the red bull's eye. the Or pal packet had been green but the green dye
was all used for munitions.
I Rations were the emergency bars of oUV-calone chocolate, so hard that
you really did need your own teeth to eat them.
K' Rations were also complete meals but, unlike "C' Rations did not need
to be heated (Wright, 1998: 26-7).
