NOTES TO CHAPTER 13
Ellis, 1990: 340.
The solidarity of the small
group has historically been exploited most
significantly in elite
units whose limited size and the tightly defined
requirements often generated a military success and influence well beyond
their notional 'effects'. The Persian King, Xerxes, for example, deployed
his 'Immortals' - so named because entry could only be acquired by the
death of an existing 'Immortal' - against the Spartans at Thermopylae in
480 BC, and one could argue that the entire Spartan army was composed
of an elite force, even though the king's bodyguard (Hippeis) were the elite
of the elite. As well shall see, one of the characteristics of elite units is the
ability of most to use their initiative and to assume command wherever
necessary. In the Spartan army this sometimes led to a refusal to obey
orders, especially if the subordinate officers and troops regarded an order
as leading to dishonourable action (Warry, 1980: 46-7). In the Theban
army 150 years earlier, 150 male couples formed the 300-strong 'Sacred
Band' originally formed as an elite guard for the Theban citadel, developed
into a unit whose framework of solidarity was rooted in the homosexual
relationship between lovers and the assumption that one partner would not
desert the other on the battlefield. When the Sacred Band was all but elim-
inated at the battle of Chaerona in 338 BC Philip II of Macedon, their
destroyer, allegedly cried over their massed bodies proclaiming: Perish any
man who suspects that these men either did or suffered anything that was

canal bridge was renamed 'Pegasus Bridge' in honour of the winged
insignia of the British Airborne forces. In November 1993 the original

the 2nd Battalion of the 505th PIR from an ammunition cart (Ramsey,

landing in Normandy and insisted on being pushed around in a wheel-
barrow - until Maxwell Taylor ordered him to return to England (Taylor,

The successful attack by ten German DFS 230 gliders on Fort Eben Emael,
Belgium's allegedly impregnable fort, on 10 May 1940, had impressed the
Allies, especially Hap Arnold. He had suggested raising 6,000 glider pilots
on a voluntary basis and 100,000 British troops had put
themselves
forward initially. Most were rejected, but on 1 June 1942 the first glider
