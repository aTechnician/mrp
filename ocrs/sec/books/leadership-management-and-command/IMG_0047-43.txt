hampered ... by the superiority of the enemy air force (and) the effect of
the heavy naval guns'? By 0930 all the major German batteries had
been hit, though there was some sporadic fire throughout the day. Most
of the damage to the landings from large artillery was achieved through
mobile guns hidden in woods that proved difficult to track down. 80

3.5 Air cover
The provision of air cover was anything but a simple deployment of the
massive superiority achieved by D-Day. To secure that meant, amongst
other things,
integrating the USAAF and RAF administration where
required, re-equipping 110 RAF squadrons with modern aircraft and
ensuring
the total staff involved (232,000 British and
181,000
Americans) were trained and in the right place do their jobs.
It was assumed that many enemy airfields would be damaged in
capture or sabotaged so planning replacement landing strips began in
December 1942 with photographic reconnaissance for the five levels of
airfield required:
• Emergency Landing Strips (ELS) - minimum length 1,800 feet.
• Refuelling and Rearming Strips (RRS) - minimum length 3,600 feet
with provision for rearming and refuelling.
• Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) - an upgraded RRS to provide
temporary accommodation to alternate squadrons.
