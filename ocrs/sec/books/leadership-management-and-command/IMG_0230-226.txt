NOTES TO CHAPTER 4
September 1940. The Germans claimed to have shot down 170 British
fighters - when only 26 were actually lost, while the British claimed that
they had shot down 185 German planes, when only 60 were lost. In effect
both sides were lying but the German lies (and losses) were bigger than the
British ones (Macksey, 1996: 117).

11. When Patton took over the 3rd Army in Normandy FUSAG's ghost army'
was taken over by Lt General L. J. McNair on 14 July. McNair was subse-
quently killed by 'friendly fire' near St Lô but his death was kept secret to
enable the deception to continue. Not until late July did the German High
Command eventually accept that there was no FUSAG (Bennett, 1995:

of National Liberation (CNL), based in Algiers but Roosevelt in particu-
lar refused to recognize its claim to sole legitimate representation of the
French people and he forbade Eisenhower from discussing the post-war
administration of France with de Gaulle until after the Allies had 'berated'
France. Nevertheless, on 26 May 1944 the FCNL proclaimed itself the

provisional government of France (Ramsey, 1995: 158-9).

43. French members of the British SAS were to suffer greatly at the hands of
the Wehrmacht who, in line with Hitler's Kommandobefehl of 18 October
1942 and 25 June 1944, regularly executed them. For example, of the 55
individuals involved in Operation Bulbasket 1 and Bulbasket 2, reconnais-
sance drops in France in support of Overlord, only 2 survived: 31 were
captured and executed by 80th Armeekorps Radfahrschwadron on 7 July
1944 near Rom. On the other hand, two members of No. 3 Troop, No.
10 Commando were saved from probable execution by the personal inter-
vention of Rommel in April 1944 after they were captured while examin-
ing beach defences in France. In fact, Masters (1997: 125-6, 221) suggests
that many local German commanders ignored Hitler's order to execute
44. The dummies were made in the Littlewoods factory at Carrickfergus. They
had first been used in September 1942 by the SAS in Egypt and were last
used in Holland in April 1945 (McLeod, 1995: 252).

invasion of southern France in August 1944, 300 dummy paratroopers
were again dropped and, once more deceived the Germans and delayed the
47.
movement of reinforcements (Westall, 1994: 29).

The Abwebr was not the only German counter intelligence organization
for the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the intelligence system of the Nazi party, also
operated against Allied intelligence, though the SD was not as large as the
Abwebr with its 13,000 employees.

51. Twenty in Roman numerals being a double X. The Allies were not the only
ones to succeed in breaking up a network of agents. The German Abwehr
managed to infiltrate the Dutch resistance from 1941 to such an extent
that 52 agents (all but one from the SOE and all but six subsequently
executed) were captured, as well as 350 local resistance fighters. In addi-
tion, thanks to the deception, London provided the Germans with 570
containers of arms and ammunition, thinking they were being dropped to
52.
the Dutch Resistance (Miller, 1998: 49-51).

Breuer, 1995: 60-2. Churchill was extremely worried about aggravating
the Irish government throughout the war - just in case Hitler occupied
Ireland (as he had intended at one point) and thus hugely increased the
risk to Allied shipping from U-boats operating from Irish ports (my own
grandfather came across two U-boats in Irish coastal waters while working
on a fishing smack during the war). Irish neutrality extended to a multi-
national POW camp on the Curragh, known as K-Lines. Prisoners of all
sides were allowed into the local pubs and were on their honour not to
escape - indeed, so concerned were the British not to upset the Irish that
at least one escapee, Bud Wolfe, an American flying with the RAF, was sent
back to K-Lines from Belfast by RAF police. So bizarre was the whole set
