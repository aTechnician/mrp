approaches: it was not the ability to lead collaboratively over Wicked
Problems that secured success for the Allies, nor the ability to manage
Tame Problems, nor even the ability to command Critical Problems, but
rather the ability to do all three at different times and in different places.
Again this reflects the issue of effective war fighting versus effective battle
fighting: being good in a crisis, or good at securing collaborative consent,
or good at managing, simply isn't good enough, you have to be good at
all three. Those who romanticize the notion of collaborative leadership -
that democratic or participative leadership will prevail over all problems
- will drown in endless and often unnecessary committees.
Those that
rely solely on Management - that targets and science can fix everything
- will forever be required to rationalize the consistent failures that follow
ineluctable from their consistent application of 'the' correct process.
Those who believe that the decisive actions of commanders are the guar-
anteed way to every victory will always want to look anywhere but at the
history for the litany of decisive failures. All attempts at the consistent
application of the same technique are likely to fail because success on D-
Day was secured - but never determined - by a judicious and subtle
blend of all three decision-modes: Leadership,
Command.

Western Allies lost six aircraft a day to accidents in 1944 and 1945
(Freeman, 1998: 94).
10. Murray, loss: 3o, In tact the greatest losses of German aircraft occurred
right at the end of the war: on 16 April 1944, 724 aircraft were destroyed
and 373 damaged; most had not even taken off (Freeman, 1998: 176).
