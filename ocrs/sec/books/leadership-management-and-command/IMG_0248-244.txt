pilots of the new Glider Pilot Regiment (GPR), part of the Army Air
Corps, began their training at Tilshead Camp, Salisbury when five officers
and 45 other ranks were addressed by their commanding officer, George
Chatterton. He impressed upon them all that they were not just pilots but
soldiers too.
Like his American
Airborne colleagues,
Chatterton's
approach was to dissuade people from joining or remaining as the most
effective way of selecting the best volunteers (Collier, 1999: 64). Having
reduced the numbers to an acceptable level, Chatterton then trained his
troops to use their initiative by setting them tasks in pairs, having dropped
them off from the back of a lorry with 2 shillings and 6 pence (about 12p)
between them. The kind of tasks were extraordinary:
• Obtain 30 minutes dual control on a steamroller
• Secure a reasoned critique of euthanasia from Professor Julian Huxley
• Secure a duck's egg signed by the singer Elizabeth Welch.
But equally extraordinary was the survival rate of these British glider
pilots: 600 landed in Normandy on D-Day itself and 580 came back for a
second mission (Collier, 1999: 65). Overall, 59 glider pilots (25 American
and 34 British) were killed in Normandy and 227 became casualties. A
further 53 were made POW (Devlin, 1994: 281).

It Brotheridge, in charge of D Company, was killed crossing the bridge
and was probably the first Allied officer killed on D-Day itself, though he
died about an hour after being shot in the neck and thus after Lance-
Corporal Fred Greenhalgh who was thrown from number 3 glider and
drowned in the pond (Bowyer, 1995: 133; Gale, 1995: 227).
The first
Allied soldier killed on D-Day depends, of course, on when D-Day actu-
ally began. Lance-Corporal Edward Hull, A Co. 9th Battalion of the
Parachute Regiment destined for the Merville battery - and part of the
only glider that actually made the link up with Otway's troops - was acci-
dentally shot at Broadwell airfield on the evening of 5 June and died on D-
Day. He is buried in North Hinksey cemetery near Oxford. The first
American casualties occurred when a gammon grenade exploded as para-
troopers of the HQ Co., Ist Battalion, 505th PIR of the 82nd Airborne
were emplaning at Spanhoe airfield. Three were killed instantly and one
died the following day. Several paratroopers were killed as they descended
carly on D-Day (Stackpoole, 1995: 256-7). The first senior German offi-
Cer to die was probably Lt General Falley, commander of the German 91st
Luftlande Division who was shot by Lt Brannen, 3rd Battalion, 508th PIR,
82nd Airborne when Falley's car was ambushed on D-Day (Ridgeway,
1995: 267); Carell, 1995: 37).

building to be liberated in France. Georges Gondrée,
the owner,
had
hidden 99 bottles of champagne in the garden and dug them up to cele-
brate his liberation. The café then became known as the Café Gondrée or
the Pegasus Bridge Café. Georges Gondrée died in 1969 and the café was
then run first by his wife and subsequently by his daughters until 1994
(Ramsey, 1995: 231). In June 1999 the restored bridge and a museum
were opened. A month before this John Howard - who had visited the
bridge every year since the war - died at the age of 86.

were actually four 10cm Czech (Skoda) field howitzers (Ramsey, 1995:
