MANAGING TAME PROBLEMS
German composition and the rest a heterogeneous group of Russians,
Poles, Tartars, Armenians, Cossacks, Mongolians, Georgians, Yugoslavs,
Koreans and even some Indians from the anti-British 'Indian Legion.
The rest were "old Germans'?? However, the 716th Division, originally
formed in Bielefeld on 2 May 1941, while it had initially been composed
of older men, by D-Day comprised many younger soldiers who had been
wounded on the Russian front and the average age was probably closer
to late twenties and early thirties rather than late forties. 3 By then it had
two infantry regiments of three battalions each (726th and 736th), as
well as the 1716th Artillery Regiment. It also had two battalions of 1,000
Ost troops, the 439th and 642nd East Battalions, which were attached
as a fourth battalion to the 726th and 736th Regiments.
The division
also had 36 howitzers and one anti-tank squadron in its artillery regi-
ment, most of which was destroyed in the initial Allied bombardment
just before D-Day.74
However, unknown to the invading Americans, the 716th were not
the only division at Omaha, because the 352nd Division, a first rate
assault division was also there. A pigeon carrying information about the
change of defenders some weeks before the invasion never reached the
Alies, and another was killed by Günter Witte of the 1,262nd Army
Coastal Artillery Regiment just two days before D-Day?5 Bradley was
torctualy told of the switch - but not until 5 June, after the invasion
force had left England and Bradley was on board Admiral Kirk's flagship
he USS Augusta. Radio silence was maintained throughout this period
thus preventing the news from belpapied to the troops approaching
Umana Beach. Facing the nine Canadian battalions on the four mile
Juno Beach, on the other hand, was one battalion of the 716th Division,
composed or the / 36th Infantry Regiment - about 400 Germans of
bodensen ge status, a misture of very young and rather old German
troopers, some of whom were partially disabled veterans of the eastern
front, plus an array of Russians and Poles."7
The 3.sops facing the British were primarily elements of the 716th
Division who were mixed in with both the 352nd Infantry Division and
the List l'anzer Division on D-Day, and an additional 1,000 Ost troops,
the 441st Ost Battalion were deployed near La Rivière. It was this unit
which collapsed early on D-Day allowing the British to press on towards
Bayeux, persuading Marcks to deployewo battalions of the Battle Group
meyer (2nd Battalion of the 915th Fdantry Regiment and Fustier
Battalion of the 352nd Infantry Divise n) as reserves to compensate

But far from being a poor group of old men, the 716th grenadiers
used tactics perfected in Russia - allowing the British and Canadian
oops to pass before opening fire from the flanks and rear, thus greatly
delaying the Allies' progress inland - especially towards Caen. 80 They
were also intent on inflicting maximum damage on their adversaries
before any thoughts of capitulation were entertained. In the process the
7l6th Infantry Division was virtually destroyed. 81 For example, the
North Shore Regiment with the Canadian 3rd Division on Juno, only
took one pill box with the help of a Royal Marine Centaur after the pill
box had expended 75 rounds from its artillery piece.82
In fact, besides the 716th Limited Employment (LE) Coastal Defence
Division, the infantry units deployed on the coast itself were two of the
352nd division's three regiments: the 726th Grenadier Regiment and the
916th Grenadier Regiment. Both the 716th and the 352nd were part of
General Marcks' 84th Corps.83 The 716th had been in Normandy since
March 1942 under Major-General Richter, and had been reinforced by
units from the 77th and 243rd Divisions in early 1944.
The Allies
papies is a weak unit comprising only 7,771 soldiers, of whom about
half were Slavs or Poles; that was an error.84 The 352nd had been acti-
vated on 5 November, just two days after Hitler's Directive No. 51 that
strengthened the western defences. The division was raised from around
Hanover in northern Germany from the remnants of the 321st Infantry
Division which had been decimated in Ukraine in the summer of 1943.
Using the cadre of remaining 321st soldiers and the new Hanoverian
recruits (some young men [18-19\some rather older {30-35), the
352nd arrived in St Lô on 5 December 1943 where it was supposed to
