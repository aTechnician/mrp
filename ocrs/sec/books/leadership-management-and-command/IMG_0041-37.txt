LEADERSHIP AND WICKED PROBLEMS
comprised 4,854 aircraft in total, with 1,968 on the western front, 1,771
on the eastern front, and 1,115 on the southern front. That suggested a
huge loss over the year given that at least 25,000 German aircraft had
been produced in that year. In contrast, the Western Allies had 8,351
aircraft available by May 1944.® In January 1944 the Germans lost 1,311
aircraft; by February the monthly loss was running at 2,121 and this
included the deaths of 434 almost irreplaceable pilots (18 per cent). The
so called 'Big Week', between 20 and 25 February 1944 resulted in the
loss of almost 2,500 Allied air crew as 240 US bombers and 33 fighters
were shot down but the attacks on German aircraft manufacturers broke
the back of the Luftwaffe. This was not in terms of destroying the capac-
ity to build aircraft, because the original 27 major factories had already
been redistributed into 729 smaller construction units, and in 1944
alone the Germans managed to build 40,500 aircraft. But they could not
replace the aircrew lost in defending the factories? By the spring of 1944
the new 108-gallon drop tank fitted to the P-51b Mustang provided
fighter cover all the way to Berlin and average Allied bomber loss rates
fell from 20-25 per cent to just 6 per cent. 0 By March a further 2,115
Luftwaffe planes were destroyed, including 511 pilots killed (22 per
cent).' The German pilot loss was 20 per cent in April, and 25 per cent
in May.
This strategy ensured that German fighter aircraft losses were running
at over 2,000 a month just prior to D-Day - twice the number of Allied
losses in aircraft at this time and twice the rate at which new German
tighter plots could be trained. In effect, in the first five months of
1944 the pilot turnover in the Luftwaffe was 99 per cent. 13 Between
January 1944 and D-Day the Luftwaffe lost 6,259 planes in combat and
roughly half that number in non-combat accidents. 14 From an average
force of 2,283, the deaths in that six months amounted to 2,262. In the
first two days of the invasion 200 fighters were moved from Germany to
France, but the pilots had been trained for air defence not ground attack
and Within two weeks the Germans had lost another 594 aircraft. In
fact, the Luftwaffe was probably never short of planes - Cooper, for
example, came across an airfield near Frankfurt in 1945 with roads
running into some local woods wherein lay over 2,000 planes, including
many Me109s, EW190s and Ju88s. The Luftwaffe ran out of pilots,
ground crew and fuel but not planes l6 Hence, the complaints of the
German ground troops when they appeared to have been deserted by the
Luftwaff in their greatest hour of need should have been tempered by
the realization that almost all the pilots that had protected them as they
celebrated the beginning of the year were already dead. Adolf Galland,
commander of the Luftwaff's fighter forces certainly argued that by

1944 the loss of pilots was far more important than the loss of planes,
indeed Germany's greatest plane production occurred in September
1944 - but by this time Allied air attacks on oil plants and the Soviet
assault on Romania had reduced German oil production to less than one
third of its rate produced in June.l7 Moreover, so great was the demand
for troops to defend Germany from Allied air attack that 900,000 were
involved in the air defence system alone (search light, anti-aircraft batter-
ies and radar facilities). 18
tained its nightly assaults upon German areas, especially industrial cities,
even proclaiming that if his plan was fully implemented a German surren-
der by April 1944 was 'inevitable'19 while 'to divert Bomber Command
from its true function would lead directly to disaster' 20 Harris's appear-
ance and style was the opposite of Spaatz's [to the extent that Harris never
even visited his bomber stations] but his methods appeared, at least to
him, to be equally effective: between November 1943 and March 1944
only 50 per cent of planned German aircraft production occurred. 21 The
debate over the utility of strategic bombing of German industry need not
delay us here; suffice to say that although German military output trebled
between 1941 and 1944 - in line with the escalation of the bombing -
Overy is surely right in his conclusion that the effect of bombing on the
German economy was not to prevent a sustained increase in output, but
to put a strict ceiling on that expansion.
From 11 May for three weeks all known Luftwaffe maintenance and
repair units within 150 miles of Caen were attacked incessantly. These
included 40 operational airfields and 59 other aircraft repair facilities.23
But the cost was high: in April and May 1944 the Allies had lost 12,000
aircrew and 2,000 planes to German fighters and anti-aircraft fire. 24
Operation Pointblank - the destruction of the Luftwaffe - was profli-
gate with the lives of Allied air crew whose average survival rate was down
to 15 missions in 1943, with 25 per cent of aircraft struck by anti-aircraft
fire on their first mission. 25 But the rewards were also high: by D-Day
the Luftwaffe - which had promised to have 1,000 fighters in the air for
the invasion - had only 319 operational aircraft within flying distance of
Normandy: 88 bombers, 172 fighters and 59 reconnaissance aircraft to
attack the invasion beaches. 26 Indeed, 124 of the fighters in the 26th
Fighter Wing were moved back from the coast on the afternoon of 4
June, presumably in accordance with the German strategy of preserving
aircraft from Allied air attack so that they could return once the invasion
began.27 Colonel Priller,
commander of the
26th
Fighter Wing,
protested vehemently to his group commander about the move: "This is
