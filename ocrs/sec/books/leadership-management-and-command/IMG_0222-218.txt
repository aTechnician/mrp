unirds of those in the ist Royal Norfolk Regiment were battle casualties
and one in six killed. For officers the rates were yet higher: almost three
quarters of all the officers serving with the 15th (Scottish) Division
became casualties and over a quarter (29 per cent) was killed. 36
In the US forces things were little different: in the lst, 4th, 9th and
29th Divisions, between D-Day and 31 July, 60 per cent of the original
rifle companies were no longer serving and 69 per cent of their officers
were absent. In June alone the 12th Regiment lost three quarters of its
officers and almost two thirds of its enlisted soldiers. On average, platoon
leaders (lieutenants) lasted about three weeks in Europe.
Battalion
commanders lasted a little longer: two of the nine battalion commanders
(majors or lieutenant colonels) of the US 29th Division were still in
command two months after D-Day.37 Ironically, one of the most danger-
ous jobs was being a medic or an 'aidman'. John Worthman, a medic
with the US 4th Infantry Division was lucky to remain alive, uninjured
and uncaptured for 'Our regiment had 80 per cent of its aidmen lost in
Normandy - wounded, killed in action or captured' 38 And though
soldiers in action usually spoke very highly of the bravery shown by most
medics, in training medics took a lot of stick. In the British Army medics
were members of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), but, as far as
the infantry was concerned, the acronym stood for Rob All My
Comrades, after medics in the Napoleonic Wars had been seen robbing
their own wounded. Or, in a reversal of the letters, it stood for Can't
Manage a Rifle 39 In the RAMC about 30 per cent were conscientious
objectors, though only 3 per cent of the total numbers of British
conscripts were conscientious objectors.40
Despite these casualty levels courts martial on the Allied side were rela-
tively rare: in the British army during the Second World War 211,684
soldiers were court-martialled, representing between 0.6 and 1.8 per
cent of the total serving force and the vast majority of these were for
being AWOL (Absent Without Leave) in Britain or for 'borrowing' mili-
tary vehicles without permission. In the US army around 30,000
soldiers were court martialled for 'serious offences' (robbery, rape and
murder) representing about 0.5 per cent of the total force. Some of the
D-Day assault troops had been informed that to stop or retreat on the
beaches would be a court-martial offence but there is little evidence that
this threat made any difference one way or the other. 42 102 Americans
were executed throughout the war (49 of them after the Normandy
campaign for raping French women) with all but one for crimes tha
would have incurred a death penalty in civilian life; only one American
was shot for desertion. In both armies desertion was primarily restricted
to infantry soldiers and just as these bore the brunt of the casualties so

too they - or rather the very young, the weakly integrated and the less
educated - tried to escape the conflict, but only in relatively small
proportions; perhaps as few as 4 per cent deserted. 43
The Allies had landed over 2 million troops in 39 divisions, along with
438,471 vehicles. They had suffered 209,672 casualties (including
36,976 dead) and lost 16,714 aircrew in 4,101 aircraft. 44
15.3 German casualties
German battle casualties are even more unreliable than Allied figures. It
is estimated that between 4,000 and 9,000 were killed in the bombing
and naval bombardments. German casualties for Omaha Beach on D-
Day are unclear, but have been estimated at 1,200.45 Including POWs,
for the slightly longer period from 6 June to 7 July 1944 there were
about 81,000 casualties but there were no replacements. 46 When the
battle for Normandy formally ended, on 19 August, 20 Germany Army,
Corps or Divisional commanders had been killed or captured and 40 divi-
sions destroyed or badly beaten with total losses at around 200,000
soldiers, 1,000 tanks, 3,000 artillery pieces.
By 11 June, 6,000 of the original 10,000 members of the 716th
Infantry Division were casualties and the division was withdrawn. Only
180 of the original 15,000 members of the 352nd Infantry Division
survived the Normandy battles. 47 By 30 June, 47,515 German casualties
