assault infantry whose task was to clear the lanes for the main body of
troops? These would land in five waves precisely twenty-seven minutes
after the underwater demolition engineers and combat engineers had
landed with the first assault wave.® Since the chances of any particular
ship being sunk or disabled were considered quite high, the larger
specialized teams were not all placed in one boat but distributed over
several, and each team carried spare capacity in troops and equipment to
compensate for assumed losses.
ashore these groups had to
reassemble themselves and that, of course, required each boat to land in
more or less the right spot.
Map 6.2 Development of the lodgment: 21st Army Group forecast of operations as of 26 February 1944
So good was the preparation and deployment on the day that, with the
exception of the Ranger assault upon the Pointe du Hoc (which was 35
minutes late), every beach was attacked within 15 minutes of the planned
time. But timing was only one problem, and less critical than the intent
of the defenders to keep the invaders out. For example, Omaha Beach, a
four mile stretch of gently curving sand and shingle, is the only plausible
for 40 kilometres between the
Arromanches, with soft sand and a low water mark some 300 to 400
meters from the high water mark - which was then a one to three metre
high shingle bank that extended in parts to over 100 metres in depth.' A
sea wall ran behind the shingle bank and behind the wall there was a
grassy plain from 150 to 300 metres deep running up to a steep 30 to 50
metre bluff or cliff from where the entire beach area could be seen. A
cross sectional representation of Omaha reproduced below reveals the
problems facing the attackers.
First, only four exits or draws existed off the beach, leading to the
towns of Vierville-sur-Mer, Les Moulins, Saint-Laurent and Coleville
