LEADERSHIP AND WICKED PROBLEMS
dishes on the road: the former blew off tracks while the latter required
the whole column to stop while the 'mine' was inspected. At Souillac, 28
Maquis volunteers held up the column for 40 hours and just before the
column reached Tulle, 45 miles south-east of Limoges, the local popula-
tion attacked the German garrison and proclaimed themselves liberated.
When Das Reich reached Tulle on 9 June the German commanding oft-
cer,
Brigadier General Lammerding, claimed that 40 of the German
garrison had surrendered and then been murdered. As a reprisal he
ordered 99 of the inhabitants, men, women and boys, to be hanged from
the balconies of houses lining the main street - while he watched the
spectacle sipping coffee from the Café Tivoli. 113 Later that day two offi-
cers of the division's Panzergrenadier Regiment 'Der Führer', were
kidnapped and one was shot at Oradour-sur-Glane.
The other escaped
and then led SS- Sturmbannführer Diekmann and a company of troops to
the village. There, the 642 inhabitants were rounded up and the 245
women and 207 children were locked in the local church that was
promptly set on fire. The 190 men were separated into smaller buildings
and shot. Diekmann was subsequently killed in action. 114
Das Reich was then constantly harassed by the Resistance on the
ground and Allied aircraft from the air all the way to the invasion zone,
giving the Allied beach-head a crucial two-week window for reinforce-
ments to arrive ll5 But a month later, just two months after arriving in
Normandy, the 20,000 troops and 238 assorted tanks of Das Reich had
been reduced to just 450 men ara uaaqunks, a casualty rate of 98 per cent
in troops and 94 per cent in tanks. 16 But the experiences of Das Reich
were relatively unusual at this point in the war - so what happened to the
rest of the Webrmacht and just how taken in were the German High
Command?
4.7 The German response
the general success of Fortitude can be gleaned from the movement of
troops and armour in the 15th Army sector defending the Calais region,
as shown in Figure 4.1.
But ironically, given the tardy and erroneous response of the Germans
o the fun up to the invasion, they were of tually aware of its imminent
arrival, duly announced in code by the BBC, because their secret service,
the SD, had already broken the code and informed General Canaris of its
importance. The SD had already infiltrated the Resistance several months
carlier and was duly awaiting one pant cular line from the BBC. On 1

Communications Reconnaissance Post, heard it, the first line of a poem
by Paul Verlaine (Les sanglots longs, Des violins, De l'automne, l17) which
routine interrogation of two members of the French Resistance by
Oberstlentnant Oscar Reile, at the Parisian HQ of the Abwehr on 1+
alerted his chiefs.
In fact, the Germans had assumed the poem would signal a general call
to arms for the entire Resistance though it was actually a specific
"Ventriloquist circuit" 19 That line, Blessent mon coeur, D'une languew,
Monotone' 120 was broadcast 15 times between 1200 and 1430 on 3 June
by the BBC and Reile alerted the 23 contacts on his list, including Jodl
at Hitler's HQ, von Rundstedt's HQ, and Rommel's HQ.
Salmuth, CO of the German 15th Army also received a copy of the warn-
ing and, despite his initial scepticism, the 15th German Army duly went
on alert - but only after his Chief of Staff, Pemsel, rang him at 0135 to
announce airborne landings. At 0200, after
Cherbourg
radar had
reported large scale ship movements towards Normandy, Pemsel again
rang Salmuth to insist that the landings constitute the first phase of a
larger enemy action'. But Salmuth still resisted, demanding that for the
time being this is not to be considered as a large
operation'. 121
evertheless Salmuth put his 15th Army on alert and informed von
Rundstedt's and Rommel's headquarters. The message read:
Teletype No. 2117/26 urgent to 67th,
82nd, 89th Corps; Military
Governor Belgium and Northern France. Army Group B; 16th Flak Division:
Admiral Channel Coast; Luftwaffe Belud m and Northern France. Message of
BBC, 2115, 5 June has been decoded. According to our available records it means
Expect invasion within 48 hours, starting 0000, June 6, 122
