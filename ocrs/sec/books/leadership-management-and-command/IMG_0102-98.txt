MANAGING TAME PROBLEMS
In 1941 Roosevelt asked Major Wedemeyer to work with his father-
in-law, Lt General Embick, on a Victory Plan. Assuming it would take
until 1943 to get organized, assuming that the Germans would then have
400 infantry divisions and had already defeated the Soviet Union, and
assuming the conventional military superiority of two to one, the Victory
Plan called for 800 Allied divisions: 32 million soldiers. The plan envis-
aged America's allies providing 100 divisions, leaving the US to find 700
divisions or 28 million soldiers from a total male population of 67.5
million. The plan also noted that no more than 10 per cent of the male
population should actually be called up. In short the plan was impossible
to achieve - unless the 316 divisions that looked achievable could subst-
tute the shortfall by the use of technology, specifically air power, mobi-
ity and firepower:" Here, was the solution to the problem: victory would
be achieved by Taming the Problem through the application of what the
US did best: the science of Management.
he overriding philosophy of the US government, then, was the so-
caled "10 per cent rule'. The 90 per cent would provide what only the
US could provide - the matériel of war in such quantities that the Axis
suffers could not win. The US gambled in 1943 that 90 divisions would
suffice to win the war: that is, a smaller number of constantly replenished
divisions rather than, as
with the German Army, a large number of
uniform, almost achieved by the end of 1943, only represented 8.5 per
cent of the American population, at a time when both the British and
Germans had over 13 per cent recruited? By )eary 1942 the US had
1.6 million men and by December
increased to 7 million, peaking at 8,300,000 with a further 4,000,000 i
the Army Air Corps (an increase of 12,000 per cent) and the Us Navy, l
As with all rational procedures intended to tame a problem an enor-
mous here of bureaucrate and pertidious impediments to the recrui
ment process developed over time. Initiali- parents had to provide si
copies of the consent form for volunteers ider 20 years old. Universt
students- many fields of study were given two-year deferments "
complete their studies. More importantly, the number of "critical occup.
cons leaped to 3,000. By late 1942 the decentralized system Was pr
ing inadequate and the War Manpower ("Emmission (WMC) was set up
to co-ordinate recruitment. At this time the average age Of a soldier In a
code tasion was 2o, and ou per cent of e recruits at a recruite
chtreited by Morgenthau, the Treasury Secretary, turned out to b
over 35. This was probably unsurprising given that 50,000 dairymen
were categorized as within a 'critical occupation'
worker linked to agriculture, forestry or mining. By 1944 the average ag

was 26 (22 in the Marine Corps) and some new infantry divisions had an
average age of 28 with ten percent older than 35. But this was not
because the US had run out of young men; it was because many of these
young men were exempt. For instance, 400,000 under 26-year olds were
in exempt occupations,
600,000 were farmers - and therefore also
exempt, 400,000 were aged between 18 and 21.I1 Altogether, over 5
million eligible men (18-37) were exempted by dint of their occupation
rather than any disability. A further 3 million men were exempted by dint
of their status as IV-Es: 'physically, mentally or morally unfit for service. 12
By 1945 there were 100,000 women serving in the US Women's
Army Corps including 6,000 officers. Some 17,000 of these served over-
seas in many areas but primarily in administration and never in actual
combat, though 38 were killed in training or driving. 13 There were also
44,000 women nurses in the US army, though these were always
stretched to cope with the increasing numbers of casualties after D-Day.
Indeed, of 132 million American citizens, the US military only drew 16.3
million into service and of these probably no more than 800,000 (5 per
cent of those in the services but just 0.6 per cent of the total population)
were involved in actual combat. Here, surely, was a manifestation of how
the US had managed to tame the problem: 99.4 per cent of the
population involved in the greatest war it had ever fought (beyond the
American Civil War) were never engaged in combat. 4 Here too we can
see the reason why the Management of the war was as, if not more,
important than the Leadership or Command of the war - almost no-one
needed to be commanded to engag papaalemy. As we shall see, t
verman approach tended to reverse this approden, concentians on the
development of effective combat units, often at the expense of the
management of resources.
By the end of 1942 almost all the Allied ground troops that were to
se combat in the war (not the 200 divisions envisaged but 89 divisions
nevertheless) had been mobilized, though only three entered combat

sons holding the western line. So tight was the western ales sure
of troops that US divisions in particular were permanently committed to
battle and almost never pulled out of the line as a complete unit. US divi
sions managed to rotate one of their three regiments out of the line but
they were always stationed in reserve just behind the combat zone and
not rested in the same way that even the Wearmace made doe almost
all of the war. But by December 1944 the American army was haemor
agg ben laster than it could replace them and 53,000 air lore
personnel were assigned to combat duties with the army. ta
