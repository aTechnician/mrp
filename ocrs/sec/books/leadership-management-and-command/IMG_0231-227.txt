up that when two Canadian pilots crash landed their plane - in what they
thought was Scotland - they staggered to a nearby pub (Lawlor's bar in
Naas) to celebrate their miraculous escape only to be faced by a bar full of
Germans in uniform (a special privilege granted by the Irish guards because
it was one POW's birthday) who demanded that the Allied pilots go drink
in their own part of the pub! (Margolis, 1999: 2).

A German 'triple'
agent, codenamed 'Teapot' worked in Hamburg,
allegedly for the British but actually for the Germans. The British were
aware of this and fed him false information (Hesketh, 1999).

67. There was no formal ceremony for Garbo's MBE, it took place in 1984 -
when Garbo revealed himself (The Guardian, 27 January 1999; Bennett,
1995: 62). He was never formally awarded with his Iron Cross. The German
hierarchy of military medals at the time of D-Day was (in ascending order):
1. Iron Cross (Second Class; First Class) (there were 3 million holders of
the Iron Cross);
2. Knights Cross (with Oak Leaves; with Oak Leaves and Swords (Michael
Wittmann, for Villers-Bocage, and Fritz Bayerlain, for Panzer Lehr,
were awarded this is Normandy);
3. Knights Cross (with Oak Leaves,
Swords and Diamonds) (Sepp
Dietrich won this at Caen));
4. Grand Cross (Only Goering won this) (Thomas, 1994: 354).

Several Allied planes were shot down by friendly fire, though not on D-
Day itself. One of the most notorious incidents occurred carly in 1945
when Spaatz and Doolittle were shot at by Patton's anti-aircraft gunners.
Spaatz complained to Patton on two counts: first, his troops had misiden-
tified a friendly aircraft; second, they had failed to shoot accurately (Mets,
1997: 268). What made the mistake worse was that Spaatz and Doolitle
were flying a twin-engined P-38 Lightening - a plane with twin boom that
made its silhouette so distinctive that it was often used to fly defensive
cover over the beachhead in Normandy - because even trigger-happy
army-gunners could not mistake it for a German plane!

90. Miller, 1998: 82, 116, 191, 194, 202. The French army before the war had
already experienced the kind of political splits that tore the country apart
under German occupation: the political left feared the French army would
do the dirty work of the anti-republican conservative elements in the estab-
lishment while the political right feared that a conscript army would bring
political instability into the heart of the state. The result was a conscript
army with only one year's compulsory service - a limited term that helped
persuade the French officer corps
that an offensive strategy against
Germany was out of the question (Kier, 1997: 7). The Resistance was also
internally split and the relationship between de Gaulle and the communist
groups was notoriously bad. When de Gaulle entered Bayeux on 14 June
he was, according to the official version, met by thousands of at, 50g
supporters. The local communist group's version is that, at most, 500
people turned up, mostly to find out who this de Gaulle - whose politics
they despised - was (Holt and Holt, 1999: 135).

and the SOE that tried to co-ordinate them, because using a secret trans-
mitter and receiver was markedly more dangerous (Miller, 1998: 43).
