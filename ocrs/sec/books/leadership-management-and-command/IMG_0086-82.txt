7 Mobilizing the Anglo-
Canadians, the
Commonwealth, and the
Volunteers
7.1 Introduction
The most puzzling thing about the British Army is how it managed to
survive the Second World War at all, despite its successes in 1918. At the
beginning of the Second World War it remained grossly under-funded
thanks to years of government parsimony; it was not organized for conti-
nental European offensive action but for Imperial defence; it was led by
an officer corps that retained its preference for the amateur gentleman
over the professional; and its tactical doctrines, such as they existed, were
still rooted in the disciplined hierarchy of the parade ground rather than
the flexible heterarchy of a mobile battlefield. The weaknesses of the
British Army did not prevail through all the units however, and the elite
soups tended to organize themselves along rather more flexible lines.
Moreover, over time the British government and the British Army
earned quickly that you could not fight a modern war without huge
financial and material resources and that equitation training had little in
common with the desperate fighting in Normandy, where casualty rates
often replicated the horrors of the First World War. Nevertheless, the
British Army persisted in its habit of retaining the highest ratio of officers
to soldiers in any major army of the time.
the British Army
seldom trusted its own soldiers to lead themselves and that proved to be
their greatest weakness: once the Germans realized the inability of most
effectively immobilize any unit ju aut folling the officers and Neus.
Nevertheless, the process of mobilization was at least lame: the British
had been there before.
