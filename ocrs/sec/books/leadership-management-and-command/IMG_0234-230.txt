centurions, battlefield veterans for whom the selection policy was much
more rigorous for, according to Polybius: 'Romans look not so much for
the daring or fire-eating type, but rather for men who are natural leaders
and possess a stable and imperturbable temperament; not men who will
open battle and launch attacks, but those who will stand their ground even
when worsted and hard-pressed and die in defence of their posts' (Quoted
in Peddie, 1994; 29).

away, Stalin ordered that any Soviet officer found to have removed his or

front line (to avoid incurring heavy casualties from an artillery bombard-
ment) and then attacking them from the flanks and rear had become stan-
dard German "defence in depth' in the second half of the First World War

The term
"Commandos'
came from the
word Commandos
(commands) but Churchill's original suggestion in 1940 had been "stormy
troopers'. When this was rejected for obvious reasons Churchill insisted
that they be called 'Special Service' troops. The
'SS' was eventually
dropped - for reasons that should also have been obvious before they were

Hitler's "Commando Order ordered that 'All enemies on Commando-
type missions, even if they are in uniform, armed or unarmed, in battle or
in flight, are to be slaughtered to the last man. If it should be necessary
initially to spare one man or two for interrogation then they are to be shot
immediately after this is completed'. After the intensification of the air
bombing campaign over Germany, Allied aircrews were added to the list
and after D-Day paratroopers and US Rangers became candidates for
immediate execution (Bruce, 1999: 49; Linderman, 1997: 97; Ramsey,
