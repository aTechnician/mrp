armies' to successfully counter the German advance. In fact this was a
semantic confusion: the group of two American divisions
was
under
Montgomery's control but there were
precious few British
troops
involved, as can be gleaned by a comparison of the casualties from the
battle: over 75,500 American and just 1,408 British (Neillands, 1996: 44).

some aspects of the training provided for the SS: minimal square bashing

SS atrocities against Jews, Poles, Russians and anyone else regarded as non-
Aryan were commonplace but they were also frequent against the troops
of the Western Allies. On 7 June 1944, 23 captured Canadians were
executed by the 25th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment of the 12th SS HI
Panzet Division under Kurt Meyer at Buron, north-west of Caen.
NOTES TO CHAPTER 9
December 1945 the commanding officer of the 25th, Kurt Meyer, was
sentenced to death by a Canadian Military Court Martial; the sentence was
subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. Meyer was released in 1954
and died in 1961 (Neillands and de Normann, 1993: 303). But atrocities
against such troops long pre-dated the Normandy campaign. On 26 May
1940 units of the SS Totenkopf executed around 100 POWs from the Royal
Norfolk Regiment at Le Paradis near Dunkirk. On 28 May, 80 British
POWs were murdered by units from the SS Leibstandarte at Wormhoudt.
Just over four years later,
during the Ardennes Offensive,
(between 20 and 120) of American POWs were executed by the same SS
division at Malmédy (Williamson,
1996: 56-8; 241-2). This one event
seems to have hardened many Americans against the Germans in general
and the SS in particular. As Harold Leinbaugh commented: 'the Germans
had committed their worst mistake of the war on the western front. We
had fought by rules ...
In the heat of battle prisoners were sometimes
killed. We knew that. But this was mass murder, and the SS was going to
have to pay and pay heavily' (quoted in Linderman, 1997: 138).

59. The Soviet attack on Berlin was extremely costly. Zhukoy, the Sovie
commander, had already experienced 30,000 Soviet dead and 700 tanks in
the four day assault upon Seelow, just to the east of Berlin which ended on
18 April. For ten days between 20 and 30 April the Soviet Army forced its
way into Berlin. Under fire from between 100,000 and 300,000 defend-
ers, including children as young as seven firing Panzerfausts, the Soviet
Army lost almost one third of its assault force - 300,000 of 1 million,
including 100,000 dead, as well as half of its tanks (2,000 of the 4,000 it
started with), in addition to 527 planes. Berlin surrendered formally on
May 2 (Grabsky, 1993: 182-4). Thus in the last weeks of the war Zhukov's
forces alone suffered, on average, almost 10,000 dead each day.

Battle of Britain - unlike the RAF - and German pilots were expected to
fly until they died, got killed, or got promoted.
