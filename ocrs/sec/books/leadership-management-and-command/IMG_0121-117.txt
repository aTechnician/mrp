MANAGING TAME PROBLEMS

ion tactics so that all young officers could take over senior positions in
On the eve of the Second World War, and after Hitler - the arch
authoritarian whose Führerprinzip embodied the Befehlstakrik principle-
control, the official army manual
repeated the approach that von Moltke had enunciated many years
before: 'A favourable situation will never be exploited if commanders
wait for orders. The highest commander and the youngest soldier must
always be conscious of the fact that omission and inactivity are worse than
resorting to the wrong expedient' 46 The inability of the British to
understand the value of this is summed up by a remark made by Sit John
Dill in 1935 on visiting the battlefield of Tannenburg; How', he asked
his host, 'had the Germans achieved such success despite the notorious
disobedience of the junior offices?'47
Subordinate initiative became apparent at many different levels in the
German army: subordinate officers replaced their dead or injured super-
ordinates as quickly as they were themselves replaced by their own
NCOs, who, in turn, were often substituted for by privates. And it sist
enabled local commanders to organized "battle groups' (Kampfrupen)
to respond to local emergencies -
as indeed occurred behind Omana
Beach on D-Day. But the opposite tradition that the German milian
theorists had spent so long to overcome - overt and total control from
the top - was reintroduced by Hitler and was critical to the undoing of
German defences. As Geyr von Schweppenburg admitted after the wal.
os Hitler had seriously undermined both the spirit and the principles of the
German command system. In the Old army, teaching on the subject of command
depended upon a cold and sober assessment of every situation, and relied upon
te competence of every subordinaluos su out his task in whatever manner
a stricd best to him. This was replaced by inrytion from Berchtesgaden, and by
a strict control of every smallest detail from thu, op. Contrary opinions were no
entertained. 48
But simply decentralizing decision-making beyond formal leaders, o
"empowering' subordinates, could not occur if the subordinates were
inadequate to the task, and to avoid the required considerable training
sus, although the Ireaty of Versailles had limited the German army to
100,000 troops, without sophistic ed weaponry and without a General
Staff, this did not prevent Hans von SeekilY he Commander in Chief of
Fe Army from 1920 to 1926, from developing this group as an office
and ne.O corps in waiting - the Mannheer. Officers were sent to univer
sities and technical schools andof rdinary soldiers were taught to replace

their immediate superior whenever necessary. Moreover, officers were
rotated between field and staff positions to prevent them from losing
touch with operational matters and to deter the creation of a staff culture
that divided the officer corps.4 Hence, when Hitler came to power in
1933 and expanded the army from its existing 7 divisions to 51 divisions
by 1939, the cadre of commanders at all levels already existed, it did not
have to be taught from scratch as did the British and American equiva-
lent. ° In all, the Germans raised over 700 divisions during the Second
Paradoxically, then, while the German ideology in its Nazi guise
rendered the world beyond ethnic Germans as one full of subordinate
races and sub-human species in a vertical hierarchy, the inward focus
rendered all Germans as virtually equal. But the official Anglo-American
ideologies of liberal democratic capitalism that outwardly espoused toler-
ance, legal and political equality, human rights and individual freedom,
simultaneously generated an inward military focus that polarized the
world between the officers and the rest, a polarization at its worst that
counter posed the privileged gentlemen to the coarse cannon-fodder.
The general result of this was the fostering of a quite different relation-
ship between officers, NCOs and troops.5l Whilst the complaints by the
Allied troops about their officers (other than those directly in the front
line) are common place, Reynolds suggests that: 'it is noteworthy that
When talking to German veterans, one rarely encounters the constant
citicisms of officers one hears from Allied soldiers' 52 This should not be
that surprising, after all, one of the primary reasons for the strict disci-
pline so pervasive amongst armiest 1o wa rce unwilling or disinterested
individuals into risking their lives For the SS and the H units the prob-
em of motivation scarcely seems to have existed; they were, after all,
personally devoted to Hitler and often capable of acts of extreme
violence. 53
9.4 Ideology and motivation
However such fanatical devotion to duty, while it spawned frighteningly
efficient military units, also created the weak link that undermined the
German military on D-Day: the defenders were capable of pushing the
Alies back into the sea, but the surrender of initiative by their senior
commanders in deference to Hitler's personal control over decision-
lo wa tectively immobilized them. After D-Day, General Queseda
remarked: 'One's imagination boggled at what the German army might
have done to us without Hitler working so effectively for our side'. 54
