tie order of assault involved the discharging of troops into thei
LCAs (Landing Craft Assault) from the various assortments of larger
ships out at sea (beyond the range of the defending artillery and outside
the known minehelds) and then the subsequent line up in waves. First to
go in should have been the LCS(M), the Landing Craft
(Medium) which carried artillery spotters to direct the naval gunfire and
rockets Onto te beden targets and also anti-aircraft guns to deler the
expected Luftwaffe assault.
Second came the DD tanks to provide
scave tire for the third line of bels (Landing Craft lank) Which
carried the specialist armour that would, in turn, cover the landing of the
the did a Crand was lo stake out and protect an area si dies deep
inland and 18 miles along the coast from the western base of the Vire
estuary at Isigny where the Utah beach-head could be protected, by link-
ing up with the 101st Airborne at Carentan, to the east to link up with
the British forces on Gold Beach, almost opposite Bayeux at Port-en-
Bessin (where the PLUTO fuel line was to emerge).
The plan for the first four hours of the assault on Omaha Beach on the
Dog sector is reproduced in Figure 6.1, and, if nothing else, the plan is
a manestation of the incredibly detailed planning that occurred in Li
run-up to D-Day. Each beach was divided into sectors on the existing
phonetic alphabetical system, and each sector was divided into two or
moard elements, usually two (red [left/port) and green (right/star-
board |) but occasionally into three, with white as an optional central area
for large areas.
Army and it was known that at least two of the six guns had already been
casemated and would therefore prove difficult to destroy from the air or
sea. In fact the guns were not 155mm and even if they
were it was
disputable that the US forces should have disembarked so far out to sea
- some three miles further out than the British and Canadian forces of
the Eastern Task Force.
The extra distance put a huge
strain on the
troops buffeted by the rough seas and, as Admiral Ramsay subsequently
pointed out, 'although one can fully sympathise with the decisions of the
Us forces... it is considered that immunity from coastal batteries should
not be given undue weight in the selection of the lowering positions,
especially when adequate naval counter battery fire is available? In the
event the post-assault naval counter-battery fire was regarded by the
Germans as formidable whilst their own attacks upon the major ships
were negligible. On 20 June Admiral Kranke admitted his weakness in
the face of these ships for "It is generally accepted that the intended
offensive by the German army has no chance of success unless the
exceedingly effective shelling by enemy naval guns of our own land units
can be prevented'.
