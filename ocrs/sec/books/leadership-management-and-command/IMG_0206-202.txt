COMMANDING IN CRISES
ain't no use staying here, we're all going to get killed!' Van de Voort
immediately set off up the beach, silenced a gun emplacement with a
grenade and took half a dozen prisoners, prompting Lewis to think hell,
if he can do that, why can't we. That's how we got off the beach', 172 The
significance of exemplary commanders' action seemed to be critical, not
just in that commanders took control or demonstrated their personal
bravery but more simply in the evidence that taking action did not neces-
sarily mean being shot - while staying on the beach appeared increasingly
suicidal. It was what Sun Tzu would have referred to as 'Death Ground'
where 'Blocked by mountains to the fore and rivers to the rear, with
provisions exhausted. In this situation it is advantageous to act speedily
and dangerous to procrastinate'. 173
Later assault troops tended to receive lighter casualties but this was
probably due to the increasing number of targets available to the defend-
ers and the value of some smoke from grass fires on the bluffs, rather than
to any degree of successful penetration by the attackers. 174 Of the 16
lanes that should have been opened up only four were completely cleared
and one German machine gunner fired 12,000 rounds until he was over-
run in the afternoon of D-Day.
There was still some fire on Easy Green, where the 115th landed but
far less than had opposed the first assault troops there in the morning,
and the gaps blown by the Ist Division assault units were sufficient to
allow the troops to disembark in relative safety. The Ist Battalion, land-
ing at 1000 was to move through Exit E-1 around the rear of St Laurent
behind Les Moulins - which it did by 1800 - while the 2nd and 3rd
Battalions landing at 1030 provided a frontal assault in the late after-
noon. At 1137 a report reached the Ist Division's HQ saying that
German troops were surrendering but it was another two hours, at 1341,
that Dog was declared clear of opposition. 175
Some 34,000 of the expected 55,000 designated for this part of
Normandy were on land by nightfall, though 2,400 were casualties, a
rate of 7 per cent that was still below the expected 12 per cent. However
the 116th alone had lost over 800 soldiers 176 As Private Paul Calvert of
the 166th recalled: The end of the day saw this group completely
fatigued, demoralized, disorganized and utterly incapable of concerted
military action'. 177
Gerardt tried ruthlessly to drive his 29th Division in Normandy but
upgi in command does not necessarily ensure complance. As the 29th
Division stumbled to a prolonged halt outside St Lo Gerhardt tried again
and again to drive his unit croista 4i6?'s to take the town but with little
initial success. I he soldiers even stopped calling him "Uncle Charlie' and
insisted that he was no longer a divisional commander but a 'corpsc

commander, given the number of corpses his strategy was generating. By
this time (mid-July) the 3rd Battalion of the 115th Infantry Regiment,
29th Division, only had 177 of the oniginal D-Day 900 soldiers left. One
platoon had just three of the original 41 left. Even then Gerhardt was
compromising in his determination to hold on to St Lô once it had
been won. As the German's &rd Fallschirmäger Division (paratroopers
counter-attacked on 17 July Gerhardt told Major Warfield of the 2nd

29th Division was replaced by the 35th Division on 20 July.
14.7.2 16th RCT of the 1st Division
The experience of the 16th RCT of the Ist Division was very similar to
that of the 116th, further west. Many of the units were blown east of
their allocated landing spots, landing on fox Green where they were
decimated by WN62 with two 75mm guns, three mortar positions and
tour machine gun posts. Lt Frerking occupied the main bunker at WN62
and provided firing instructions for the artillery battery at Houteville five
16z's south. He also controlled the machine gunners and ordered them
to wait until the boats touched down, approximately 400 yards from the
Dunker. 79 Nearby, with an 88mm gun, WN61 covered Exit F-3 north
of Colleville. WN61 was put out of action at 0710 by Sergeant.
