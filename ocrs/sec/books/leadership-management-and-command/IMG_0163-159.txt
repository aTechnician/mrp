12.1 Commanding soldiers to kill
The capacity of soldiers to kill on order and to remain doing so has
alvays proved troublesome for higher command, because an army may
be a dumb beast which kills when it is set down but its soldiers also feel
pain! Looking back at D-Day
one quote always comes to mind: 'A
