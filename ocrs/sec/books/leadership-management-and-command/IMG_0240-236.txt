common in the early part of the Normandy campaign. For instance, he
claims that 25 German and Georgian POWs were executed by members of
the 502nd PIR at Herguerie on June 6. On 8 June armoured cars from C
squadron the Inns of Court, captured ten officers from the Panzer Lehr
artillery regiment and ordered them to walk in front of the vehicles as
human shields. When they refused the senior officer, Luxenburger was
beaten and tied to the front of one of the cars, the rest - except Major
Zeisler who escaped - were executed. When the cars tried to return to their
lines they were shot at by anti-tank guns of the 12th SS Panzer Division
HJ, who freed Luxenburger, though he died ten days later. On the same
day as Luxenburger's capture and release the 12th SS H] executed 20
Allied prisoners at Audrieu for which Kurt Meyer was convicted. Three
other Canadian prisoners were executed on June 9 at Putot by 26th SS
Panzergrenadier Regiment after another of the 'executed' Panzer Lebr
officers managed to escape after the
shooting.
Two officers of the
Regiment were tried and executed for the murder in January 1949

the position where they had halted at 0550 until 0835. Kraisse, assuming
that the Omaha landings were repulsed, sent them both to Gold beach,
fifteen miles away, to halt the British attacks. By the time they arrived it was
noon. Indeed his penultimate reserves, the 620 troops of the 352nd
Engineer Battalion were not deployed towards St Laurent until 1825. The
last group, 625
soldiers of the
Feldbataillon (replacement battalion)
reached the coast the following morning. On 7 June only one more battal-
ion of German reinforcements arrived to support Kraisse, from the 30th

generated 23,000 new millionaires.

earned $1 a day in France, American shipyard workers were earning $18 a
day (Eiler, 1997: 306).
