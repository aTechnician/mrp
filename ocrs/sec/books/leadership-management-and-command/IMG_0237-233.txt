Legg, 1994: 5. When a black American soldier was sentenced to death for
an 'offence against a local West Country woman, 10,000 locals petitioned
the government for a stay of execution (Blandford, 1999: 53).

250,000 women served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) - the
replacement for the First World War's Women's Army Auxiliary Corps
(WAACs) - primarily in the anti-aircraft units or as drivers, office workers
and telephonists and so on. Additionally, another quarter of a million
women enrolled in the Civil Defence, the Royal Observer Corps, the
Women's Land Army, and the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. Women were
barred from engaging in combat - except for those recruited to the SOE
who sent 50 women agents to France. These women circumvented the
combat prohibition
by enrolling in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry
(FANY) (Forty, 1998: 318-19). In 1999 women were not allowed to serve
in combat in the British Army but they were allowed in 'supporting roles'.
In today's US forces women are not allowed to serve in tanks but they are
allowed to be air force pilots or even join the 'Navy Seals'. The French also
women in their air force but not the infantry. The Chinese Army has
women generals but they are not allowed to serve in combat. Women are
permitted in combat in Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway.
Women in the German Army cannot serve in combat units but can carry
arms for self-defence (Guardian, 2 July 1999).

Quoted in Ambrose, 1995: 134. On 25 July 1944, an accidental gas alarm
was sounded in the area controlled by the US 3rd Armoured Division in
Normandy. That night a vapour was seen escaping from a US decontami-
nation truck and once again the gas alarm was sounded. The result was, to
all intents and purposes, pandemonium. General Bradley was horrified at
the panic and issued an immediate order forbidding any gas alarms - even
if gas was used: 'Any soldier giving the gas alarm, regardless of the circum-
stances, is to be shot on sight by the closest available soldier' (quoted in
Cooper, 1998: 43). In August 1944 Cooper (1998: 85) recalled meeting
a German officer who surrendered just before the fall of Paris and revealed
the whereabouts of a poison gas depot near Alençon. Anthrax bombs were
tested by the British at Porton Down in 1941 and in field tests in 1942 on
Gruinard Island in
north Scotland and Penclawdd
south Wales
(Guardian, 21 July 1999). A report in the Guardian on 20 August 1999
suggested that at least one British serviceman, RAF mechanic Ronald
Maddison, had died in the 1950s after being given 200mg of Sarin at
Porton Down.

78. The German term was Schnellboot (S-Boot) but the Allies called them 'E'
for Enemy'. They were double the size the British Motor Torpedo Boat
or US PT Boat.
79. Including ten officers who were privy to BIGOT secrets. BIGOT was the
highest level of secrecy, above "Top Secret' about Operation Overlord and
derived from the reverse letter order of 'To Gib' the imprint placed on all
papers provided to people going to Gibraltar in November 1942 to discuss
the invasion of North Africa (Breuer, 1995: 172). 'Dead Man's Bay' was
the name given to the area in Thomas Hardy's novels on the basis of earlier
shipwrecks (Legg, 1994: 40).

82. This was not just to protect the Overlord operation - photos of American
dead were only allowed to be published after September 1943 and even the
first photo of three dead Marines at Tarawa lying in the sand with no sign
of their faces or their injuries was regarded by some as 'making a mockery
of sacrifice' (quoted in Linderman, 1997: 328).

88. The lifespan of a lieutenant was probably even shorter than that of a rife-
man. In the ETO it was estimated at around one
month in combat
(Linderman, 1997: 30). Even that was long compared to the 24 hours life
expectancy of a Soviet private during the battle of Stalingrad (Channel 4:
"The War of the Century, 19 October 1999). The response of many sim-
larly despised groups is to increase the issue that generates the contempt,
thus animal slaughterers insist on wearing blood stained overalls when
drinking after work and adopt bloodspots
for hobbies (Ackroyd and
Crowdy, 1990: 3-12). Similarly, the "untouchables' who clean the streets

of Benares now Varanasi (Searle-Chatterjee, 1979).

Juneau was sunk and it became US policy to split family members up to
Prevent such a recurrence. However, Company A of the 116th Regiment
suffered 90 per
cent casualties and had 22 deaths from one village,
Bedford, Virginia, including three sets of brothers.
The closest case to the
actional invate Ryan was that of the Nland tamily from buttalo, New
York, who had three brothers in Normandy and one in Burma, as well as
two cousins, one of whom jumped over St Mère-Eglise. Fritz Niland
