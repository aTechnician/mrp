10.1 Introduction
D-Day was the largest-ever amphibious operation. It involved 175,000
Allied troops and 50,000 vehicles, all of which were landed either by air,
using 11,000 planes, or by sea, using 6,833 ships, and all within 24
nours. The battle for Normandy, which D-Day initiated, lasted until the
cha of August 1944 and was the largest single battle ever undertaken by
Sure ern Allies against Germany. The Allied forces involved 40 divi-
sions: 23 American in Bradley's 25th US Army Group, and 17 in
Montgomery's 21st Army Group (13 British, 3 Canadian and 1 Polis.

1994: 221), but rewer planes and, obviously, no ships. When the soun
Army launched its summer offensive in 1944 to coincide with Overlord,
it had amassed 2.5 million soldiers, 5,200 tanks and 5,300 aircraft,
though of course not all of them were deployed in the first 24 hours?
However, the military significance oftl-e German losses in Normandy
was greater than those at the battle of Stalingrad. In all, only 30,000
German troops and 120 tanks esed, ed across the river Seine from the
