NOTES TO CHAPTER 8
2. Forty, 1995: 1. That meant that everything had to be taken, including £20
million in cash carried by members of the Royal Army Pay Corps (RAPC).
The amount of food consumed was also enormous. For example the 53rd
(Welsh) Division consumed 6 million rations (14,363 tons of food) in the
European campaign of 1944 45 - the equivalent of each soldier eating
fourteen times his own bodyweight (Forty, 1998: 134-8).
3. A division - an organizational form first pioneered by the French revolu-
tionary army in 1792 (Parker, 1995: 198) - was the smallest unit capable
of operating independently. Each infantry division in the US army (66 of
the 89 US divisions existing in 1945 were infantry divisions) comprised -
on average - over 15,000 troops plus vehicles and artillery (though the
assault divisions on D-Day were much larger). Each division comprised
three or perhaps four regiments and each regiment comprised three or
sometimes four battalions and various assorted companies (HQ, anti-tank,
cannon and service). Each battalion was made up of three or four rifle
companies and a heavy weapons company (carrying heavy machine guns
and mortars) and totalled around 870 troops in all. A rifle company had
three rifle platoons and one weapons platoon (the latter carried the light
machine guns and light mortars) and each rifle platoon had three squads,
the smallest unit, of twelve soldiers. Squads were divided into a squad
leader, a two soldier scouting section, a four-soldier fire section and a five-
soldier manoeuvre and assault section (Forty, 1995: 70-1/174). In 1942
a US Airborne division comprised one paratroop and two glider regiments,
around 8,500 troops in all. By 1944 the makeup had changed to three
paratroop and one glider regiment, around 7,500 troops in all (Ramsey,
1995: 263).

The typical British Army structure was as
follows (though each army and each element therein was somewhat
idiosyncratic):
10 soldiers = 1 Squad
30 soldiers = 1 Platoon (3 Squads)
90-120 soldiers = 1 Company (3 or 4 Platoons)
360-800 soldiers = 1 Battalion (4, 5 or 6 Companies + HQ + armour +
artillery)
1,080-2,880 soldiers = 1 Brigade (3 or 4 Battalions + HQ + armour +
10-20,000 soldiers = 1 Division (3 Brigades + HQ tarmour + artillery)
Division = 5 brigades = 4,320 soldiers + 3 machine gun battalions (900) +
13,280 service troops. To make total 18,500 troops.
By comparison the tail of Waffen SS units tended to be much smaller;
close to half the size of the British equivalent division (Blandford, 1999;
120-2) Thus a typical British infantry division in 1944 comprised about
18,000 soldiers in total: 8,482 infantry, 6,289 from other combat arms,
and 3,576 HQ and services. The division would have three brigades of

three battalions, three field artillery regiments, one anti-tank regiment
with 17lb guns, a light anti-aircraft regiment with 40mm Bofors guns, an
armoured reconnaissance regiment, a machine
gun
battalion which
included 4.2 inch mortars, an engineer regiment, a signals regiment, serv-
ie corps personnel. Ordnance and electrical engineers (Graham, 1999:
134). Two divisions would typically make up a "Corps' and two 'Corps'
comprised an army. An Army Group combined two armies.
In the US forces a conventional infantry division comprised 15,000
troops in three regiments, each of which had three battalion and each
battalion was made up of about six companies with four platoons per
company. A company was usually led by a captain and a platoon led by a
lieutenant. Each platoon had four squads of a dozen soldiers including a
sergeant and a corporal.
A typical US armoured division did not
comprise just tanks but, normally, three tank battalions (with four
platoons in each battalion and four tanks to a platoon, i.e., 48 tanks to a
division); three battalions of armoured infantry (infantry carried in half-
tracks); three battalions of armoured artillery (self-propelled guns); an
armoured cavalry reconnaissance battalion; a tank destroyer battalion;
and an armoured engineers' battalion. But the vast majority of divisions
in the US army during the Second World War (68 of 91) were infantry.
Four of the others were airborne and one was a cavalry division, all of
which operated as infantry divisions. In effect 73 of the 91 divisions were
infantry (McManus, 1998: 6-7).

11. The numbers avoiding military service may have been critical in extending
the war. For example,
Eisenhower claimed that if he had an additional ten
divisions in late 1944 he could have ended the war by the end of that year
Eiler, 1997: 404).
12. Eiler, 1997: 397. There were 13 draft classifications:
LA Fit for general military service
IB Fit for limited military service
IC Member of the Armed Forces
ID Student fit for general military service
IE Student fit for limited military service
IIA Deferred for critical civilian work
IIIA Deferred due to dependants
IVA Already served in the armed services
TVB Deferred by law (such as draft officials)
IVC Alien
IVD Minister
IVE Conscientious Objector (there were 42,793 registered; only 5,000
Witnesses)
nen were imprisoned for failing to register, most of these were Ichovah's
IVE Physically, Mentally or Morally unfit for service (Wright, 1998: 8,
