15.2 Allied casualties beyond D-Day
Allied battle casualties from 6 to 30 June 1944 were approximately
62,000 with 79,000 replacements. The US had suffered 37,000 casual-
ties The Anglo-Canadians had taken around 25,000 casualties (3,356
15,815 wounded and 5,527 missing, most of whom were
presumed to be prisoners).24 By then the Allies had landed 875,000
troops, 150,000 vehicles and 570,000 tons of stores and the British
24,698 casualties.
By the end of the battle for Normandy, usually taken as 15 August
with the fall of Falaise, Montgomery's 2Ist Army Group had suffered
83,000 casualties, including 16,000 deaths, mostly suffered by the
combat arms comprising just 56 per cent of the total numbers.25
Ironically, for all that Montgomery tried to avoid replicating the
bloodbath of the First World War, the Normandy campaign overall
sustained casualty figures on a par with and sometimes well above, those
suffered on the Western Front between 1914 and 1918. On average,
British involvement in the
battle of Ypres in
1917,
including
Passchendacle, resulted in 244,000 casualties or 2,121 a day. The battle
for Normandy resulted in 200,000 casualties, a rate of 2,354 a day.
However, many of the troops involved still believed that their own expe-
nence in Normandy had been nothing like those of their fathers in the
fields of Flanders 20 years earlier. 26 For example, by 3 September 1944
there were approximately 270,000 Allied and 200,000 German dead,
wounded or missing [the Germans also lost an additional 200,000 as
POIVS))27 By late October 1944 Eisenhower was to admit 'that 2,500
americans are falling in battle every day' 28 By early 1945 this number
had increased, and in the third week of January 22,825 became casual-
tis By comparison, in May 2007 the total number of US casualties in
laq in the four years plus since the invasion (March 2003) is 25,225
including 3,509 deaths. Put another Allied casualties in Normandy were
more than 140 times those suffered in Iraq.
Equally significant, most of these casualties were to the minority of
tops making up the infantry rifle companies. 30 This was already obvi-
ous in 1943 when a study of US casualties suggested that 70 per cent
were taken by the infantry,31 and the Normandy campaign was expected
to result in a similar figure 32 That figure, if anything, increased to almost
80 per cent by the end of the war. 33 The Canadians had expected around
50 per cent of their casualties to be amongst the infantry but over 75 per
cent was the eventual figure 34 In one case a single US company took
400 per cent casualties and altogether 18 infantry divisions in Europe
sutired over 100 per cent casualties, 35
ane probability of disproportionate number of casualties suffered by
the rife carrying infantry was already clear in 1940 to Churchill who
suggested that for every infantry division of around 15,500 soldiers a
turther 20,000 were engaged in servicing them and of the original
15,500 only around 4,000 actually carried a rifle. For the US armies a
similar picture emerges with only around 37 per cent of the total number
unrolved in any form of combat (in the Pacific around 18 service troops
nice needed to keep one combat soldier in the field). The results were
predictable: in the bnitish army in the ormandy campaign the infant y
I imprised 25 per cent of the total but 71 per cent of the casualties. In
the American army the intantry soldiers comprised just lu per cent of the
total but 70 per cent of the casualties. In effect, one in three of the Allied
intantry that fought in Normandy became a casualty (in the Pacific and
Far East campaigns about one in ten Americans became a casualty and
une in 15 Commonwealth soldiers) alor some US divisions, such as the
4th who landed at Utah on D-Day, almost a fifth were killed by the end
of the war and two thirds were wounded. The 29th Division, with a
nominal 14,000 troops, suttered 20,111 casualties from D-Day to tho

In the SUth Northumbrian Division that landed on Gold Beach, half
of all the troops who served (including the 80 per cent repacements)
became casualties in the Normandy campaign, while almost 60 per cent
of the 15th (Scottish) Division suffered the same fate.
