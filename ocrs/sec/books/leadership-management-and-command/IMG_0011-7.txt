Part One
Leadership, Management
and Command at D-Day
This book has been in the making for over eight years. It began life as the
final chapter to one of my previous books, The Arts of Leadership, but,
like Topsy, it just grew. It has sat on various floors and computers half
finished for about five of these years and only recently have I managed to
find the time and motivation to finish it - thanks to Stephen Rutt for
providing the last piece of the jigsaw. Many people have helped me in this
marathon journey. Institutionally I would like to thank the ESRC,
Templeton College and the Said Business School at Oxford University,
Lancaster University, and Cranfield University at the Defence Academy
of the UK. Individually I would like to thank Mike Harper for many
conversations about D-Day and his old unit; Hal Nelson for showing me
round Normandy the first time; whoever the German train guard was
that arrested me in 1971 in Germany for not having the appropriate
papers and whose stories of his capture on D-Day by the British passed
the small hours of the night away waiting for the next train; Sapper
Anderson for his marvellous conversations, memories and letters about
D-Day+2 when he arrived there; Connie Woolgar for alerting me to the
role of the German-speaking British Commandos on D-Day; David
Benest and Peter Gray at the Defence Academy for trying to put me
straight on the military road to D-Day; Tara Moran for helping select the
cover and keeping me organized; the many recipients of my various
witterings over the years; Katy for providing the music via Past Perfect;
Richie for advice on small arms; and finally Sandra, Beki, Simon and Kris
for putting up with yet another holiday built around a book - sorry guys
and gals!
I would like to thank HMSO for permission to reproduce the maps.
