MANAGING TAME PROBLEMS
of 1941 a strike in an aviation plant at Inglewood, California against the
advice of the NDMB, and the strikers' own union leaders, led Roosevelt
to send in the army and 2,500 troops with fixed bayonets evicted the
strikers. Within three days the plant was handed back to the owners and
work resumed. In August 1942 a Boston company manufacturing
artillery shells refused to accept a trade union agreement brokered by the
War Labor Board (WLB), as the final arbiter of industrial disputes.
Eventually the government took over the plant, bringing in a contractor
to run it on their behalf. 15
Even with formal industrial disputes under control, informal problems
remained. For example, in the week after Christmas 1942, over a quarter
of Boeing's workforce failed to turn up for work. At this time, when aver-
age British absences were running at 30 minutes per person per year, US
absenteeism was operating at 7 per cent, several times higher than
normal. • But industrial disputes remained to plague the war cfort

in europe. In that last year of the war 3 million workers were involved
in 4,600 strikes. 20
In fact the American Arsenal of Democetcy was very slow in getting
nead of steam up: in 1941, when half of Britain's and Germany's gross
national product was devoted to the war effort, the Us only managed t
devote 16 per cent to the same end. Patterson began ramping up the
effort level by insisting that war production facilities were employed

American air power would win the war against Germany. But even as
Patterson ordered restrictions on the use of aluminium the army's own
quartermaster ordered 100,000 aluminium syrup pitchers - because
they were 3.8 cents cheaper that the glass alternatives. Despite the
restrictions, in late 1941 about 35 per cent of US aluminium was still
being used in non-aircraft production, compared to just 8 per cent in
Britain. 22
Copper, a crucial element in munitions, was also in short supply, espe-
cally in 1942 when steel was substituted in large calibre munitions. At
this point the shortage of 8,000 copper miners was equivalent to an
annual loss of 120,000 tons of copper - or 8 billion rounds of. 30 calibre
ammunition. Nonetheless, American industry was still using copper to
manufacture soda siphons, fridges, electric fans, lamps, and so on. A
partial resolution to the general labour shortage was for 4,000 copper
miners recently recruited to the military to be furloughed back into the
mines in 1942 - a resolution of the problem that Patterson thought
inherently wrong when many miners were still employed in gold mines.
But by October 1942 most of the gold and silver mines were closed.
then in the summer of 1942 another 4,500 soldiers were furloughed
back to the copper mines.23 But this still did not resolve the copper
shortage because in the spring of 1943 many of the furloughed copper
miners were directed to work on farms instead. Indeed, a serious attempt
was made by agricultural interest to furlough 375,000 troops - 10 per
cent of the enlisted ground troops - back to the farms. With 3 million
men on farms already safe from military conscription, the number avoid-
ing the draft was rapidly undermining the war effort. This was partly the
reason for the rapid expansion in the number of women - the mythical
Rosie the Riveter amongst them - employed in US industry: in 1940, 25
per cent of the American labour force was female; by 1944, this had
increased to 36 per cent. 24
even sugar became rationed - though was the Us ally unbang to
million bottles of Coca-Cola this was understandable. Perhaps the most
ironic act of the government was in response to the navy's requirement
for rope: 50,000 acres of Cannabis sativa were grown. Rubber was also

rubber supplies and speed restrictions were introduced to

aside to grow guayale, a rubber substitute, though only ,o00 tons or
rubber was ever produced. 26 A national scheme to collect 10 million tons

had been introduced in December 1942)l atted, amongst other things,
