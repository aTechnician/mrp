Part Three
Managing Tame Problems
Introduction
Part Three of the book swings away from the strategic, long term issues
often associated with Wicked Problems and concentrates on those areas
where Management might prevail: Tame Problems.
These, you may
recall, are problems that have been faced before and there is normally an
effective, rational process for resolving the problems. This, in contrasort.
Leadership, is the world of science, of objectivity and of systems; in shorts
this is the land where certainty should prevail. To examine whether this
is the case we shall consider several aspects of the D-Day operation, in
particular the recruitment and training of troops, the construction of
logistics and the development of technologies.
