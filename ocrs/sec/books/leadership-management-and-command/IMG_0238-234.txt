(101st Airborne) was asked to identify a dead brother and discovered that
it was not the one he expected to find and he had, therefore, lost both
brothers (Sergeant Robert Niland, 506th PIR, 82nd Airborne and Lt
Preston Niland, 22nd Infantry, 4th Division). The cousin in Burma (who
had gone to school with Charles Deglopper, winner of the Medal of
Honour at La Fière bridge) was declared missing and Fritz Niland was
withdrawn from active service. His cousin was eventually discovered to
have been taken prisoner and survived the war (Bremner, 1998: 50-1;
Holt and Holt, 1999: 110). There was a 'real' Private Ryan involved in D-
Day in the shape of Private Jim Ryan, a tank driver with the Westminster
Dragoons who landed on Sword Beach. His story is captured in the video
The True Story of Private Ryan (Paradox Films). The Niland brothers are
buried in the US Military Cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach (plot F,
row 15, No. 11 & 12), as are 38 other pairs of brothers and a father and
son (the Reeds, plot E, row 20, No. 19 & 20). In total there are 9,286
bodies in the cemetery, 307 are unknown and four are women, killed on
active service in the Red Cross and the Woman's Auxiliary Corps (Holt and
Holt, 1999: 116).

106. Quoted in Ambrose, 1995: 49. Freud's assertion about the cause of hero-
ism is similarly developed: No instinct we possess is ready for a belief in
lour own] death. This is perhaps the secret of heroism' (quoted in

108. The rituals were many and varied, with bomber crews making a particularly
superstitious group, though the rituals were often counterpoised; some
groups went out of their way to arrange dates for the evening after a raid,
while others openly spoke of their imminent deaths - so as not to court
fate. One B-29 crew of 11 in the Pacific theatre insisted that all 11 crew
members wore identical hats on each mission (Linderman,
1997: 68).

113, In the summer of 1942 the US Army introduced V-mail, a system for
reducing the standard 8.5 x 11 inch letters to a 16mm film for transmis-
sion, when they were enlarged to a 4 x 6 inch format. The technique
reduced the weight of 2,57 5lbs of mail to just 45lbs. Between that summer
