15.2 Allied casualties beyond D-Day
Allied battle casualties from 6 to 30 June 1944 were approximately
62,000 with 79,000 replacements. The US had suffered 37,000 casual-
ties The Anglo-Canadians had taken around 25,000 casualties (3,356
dead, 15,815 wounded and 5,527 missing,
most of whom were
presumed to be prisoners).24 By then the Allies had landed 875,000
troops, 150,000 vehicles and 570,000 tons of stores and the British
By the end of the battle for Normandy, usually taken as 15 August
with the fall of Falise, Montgomery's 2lst Army Group had suffered
83,000 casualties, including 16,000 deaths, mostly suffered by the
combat arms comprising just 56 per cent of the total numbers 25
Ironically, for all that Montgomery tried to avoid replicating the
bloodbath of the First World War, the Normandy campaign overall
sustained casualty figures on a par with and sometimes well above, those
suffered on the Western Front between 1914 and 1918. On average,
British involvement in the
battle of Ypres
including
Passchendaele, resulted in 244,000 casualtie or 2,121 a day. The barde
for Normandy resulted in 200,000 casualties, a rate of 2,354 a day.
However, many of the troops involved still believed that their own expe-
rience in Normandy had been nothing like those of their fathers in the
spray it Flanders 2U years earlier. For example, by 3 September 194t
there were approximately 240,00) spray and 200,000 German dead,

wounded or missing [the Germans also lost an additional 200,000 as
POWs]).27 By late October 1944 Eisenhower was to admit 'that 2,500
Americans are falling in battle every day' 28 By early 1945 this number
had increased, and in the third week of January 22,825 became casual-
ties. By comparison, in May 2007 the total number of US casualties in
Trag in the four years plus since the invasion (March 2003) is 25,225
including 3,509 deaths. Put another Allied casualties in Normandy were
more than 140 times those suffered in Iraq.
Equally significant, most of these casualties were to the minority of
troops making up the infantry rifle companies. 30 This was already obvi-
ous in 1943 when a study of US casualties suggested that 70 per cent
were taken by the infantry,31 and the Normandy campaign was expected
to result in a similar figure. 32 That figure, if anything, increased to almost
8o per cent by the end of the war. 33 The Canadians had expected around
50 per cent of their casualties to be amongst the infantry but over 75 per
cent was the eventual figure.* In one case a single US company took
400 per cent casualties and altogether 18 infantry divisions in Europe
sultered over 100 per cent casualties. 35
The probability of disproportionate number of casualties suffered by
the rifle carrying infantry was already clear in 1940 to Churchill who
suggested that for every infantry division of around 15,500 soldiers a
further 20,000 were engaged in servicing them and of the original
15,500 only around 4,000 actually carried a rifle. For the US armies al
imilar picture emerges with only around 37 per cent of the total number
volved in any form of combat (in the Pacific around 18 service troops

Predictable: in the British army in the Normandy campaign the infantry
comprised 25 per cent of the total but 71 per cent of the casualties, In
he amencan army the infantry soldiers Ct prised just 10 per cent of the
total but 70 per cent of the casualties. In effect, one in three of the Allied
nantry that fought in Normandy became a casualty (in the Pacific and
far East campaigns about one in ten Ame cans became a casualty and
one in 15 Common wealth soldiers), For some US divisions, such as the
in who landed at Utah on D-Day, almost a fifth were killed by the end
of the war and two thirds were wounded. The 29th Division, with a
1 ominal 14,000 troops, suffered 20,111 casualties from D-Day to the
end of tri+ turopean war, including 3,720 dead - the second highest of
any US division.
In the 50th Northumbrian Division that landed on Gold Beach, half
of all the troops who served (ince at ure 80 per cent replacements)
became casualties in the Normandal ampaign, while almost 60 per cent.
