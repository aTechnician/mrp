The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
disingenuous. Caution seemed to have been the order of the day at XXX Corps,
although Dempsey and Montgomery do not appear to have been following the
developments in Villers Bocage very closely either. For his part, Dempsey was ex-
tremely unhappy with the attack conducted by XXX Corps and the 7th Armoured
Division and he claimed after the war:
The attack by the 7th Armoured Division should have succeeded. My feeling that
Bucknall and Erskine would have to go started with that failure .... If he (Erskine)
had carried out my orders he would never have been kicked out of Villers Bocage Dut
by this time the 7th Armoured Division was living on to paddon and te wor
handling of that battle was a disgrace. Their decision to withdraw was made withou
onsulting me, i was done by the cottonate re
Dempsey did not, however, say what his orders for Erskine were. Within the
7th Armoured Division, the view was taken that the disaster had been caused by the
4th County of London Yeomanry forging ahead without adequate reconnaissance,
but this was not correct, as Lord Cranley had requested to make a reconnaissance
before moving to Point 213 and was told to push on by Brigadier Hinde." Lord
Cranley was taken prisoner at Villers Bocage and therefore could not defend this
charge at the time.
Other post-war historians see the defence of the box at Amaye as a victory i
erms of the numbers or casualties inflicted on the verman nantly and the
nat the Poston should have been rentorced be to

The Germans, for their part, had succeeded in roping off the Allied lodge-

The Allies had not yet captured their D-Day objective of Caen and the Germans
attacks, the Germans had been forced to use three of their panzer alvisions from
he strategic reserve; these divisions had then become entangled in the trontline,
unable to disengage and regroup for any counterattack. For Montgomery, the im-
mediate goal was to continue the build-up of the Alled forces asnore.
