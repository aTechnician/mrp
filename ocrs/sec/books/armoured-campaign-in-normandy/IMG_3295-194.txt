Operation Tractable
For Montgomery there were at last signs that the stalemate in Normandy was about
to be broken. Patton's Third Army was advancing largely unopposed towards the
major German supply hub for the Seventh Army at Alençon and the
doomed
counterattack by the German panzer divisions had been defeated at Mortain,
leaving them concentrated on the extreme left flank of the Seventh Army. It was
General Bradley who first recognised the possible encirclement of the Germans
in Normandy and raised it with Montgomery, who agreed to pursue what would
become known as the short hook. In a signal to Brooke on 8 August, Montgomery
mentioned for the first time the possibility of encirclement and stated that he was
trying to get to Falaise and Alençon as the first step in closing the ring behind
the enemy?" Only 24 hours earlier, Montgomery had impressed on Crerar of the
Canadian First Army that whilst Falaise was the objective of Operation Totalize,
the army (especially the Polish Division) was to advance no further eastwards than
the River Dives until the situation at Mortain had been resolved. On 8 August
Bradley directed Patton to develop the southern pincer by an advance to Alençon
and Argentan to meet the advancing Canadians.
Three days later, the situation had become clearer as Patton swung northwards
towards Alençon and the German offensive did not resume in any great strength,
despite the orders of Hitler to continue the offensive after regrouping? Montgomery,
in his directive of it August, referred to the developing encirclement and ordered
that as a prelude to closing the gap behind the main enemy forces it was 'vital'
that the Canadian First Army quickly' capture Falaise and Argentan to choke off
the German supply lines that ran through the area.+ Having committed the expe-
rienced British armoured divisions to a breakout attempt in Operation Bluecoat,
the changing strategic situation offered the opportunity to encircle the German
Seventh Army but Montgomery only had the inexperienced Canadian First Army
to spearhead the attack to Argentan. In his evening signal to Brooke the same day
Montgomery outlined the day's progress:
