Operation Goodwood
Operation Goodwood is one of the most studied battles in modern history as
the tirst Allied mass employment of tanks with three armourea divisions in the
Second World War. However, for all this research, the outcome continues to be
debated along with the number of British tanks lost. The official British history
i crcumspect on the outcome, stating that although the position on the east of
we River Orne had been improved, all the intended cogects were dot set dale
in some respects execution fell short of intention' Belfield and Essame state that
the Germans had resisted "any breakthrough' and lament the lack of co-operation
between infantry and armour? The British Cabinet history reflects Montgomery's
tinal plan to dominate the area of Bourguébus-Vimont and Bretteville whilst writ-
in down German armour and states that these objectives were largely attained.?
Interestingly, the Cabinet history is non-judgmental and gives the different opin-
lons of Montgomery, Dempsey and O'Connor on the outcome. General Bradley,
in his biography, suggests that the whole operation and subsequent commotion was
part of a deliberate attempt to deceive the Germans about the place and date of the
American breakout. Yet, as Belfield and Essame point out, this was the most pow-
erful attack yet by the British in the Normandy battle, which does not support an
objective of merely attempting to deceive the Germans.
The debate over Operation
Goodwood continued long after the war as both Eisenhower and Montgomery
used their biographies and articles to explain their positions and intentions, thereby
perpetuating the controversy. Both were aided by various members of their com-
mand staff, such as General Bradley for Eisenhower
General Belchem for
Montgomery, publishing works that supported their leaders
positions.
The background to the development of the plans for Operation Goodwood is
Worth examining in detail as the evolution of the plans directly influenced the
outcome of the battle. The planning process itself also directly contributed to the
furore that erupted after the battle, which marked the beginning of the long-
standing feud between Montgomery and Eisenhower.
Following the capture of Cherbourg, Montgomery's orders of 30 June were for
Bradley to continue offensive action on the right flank by advancing south and then
