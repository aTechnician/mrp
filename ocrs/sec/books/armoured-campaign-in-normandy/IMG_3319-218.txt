The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
Clearly, this report contains some errors for June and July, as 179 tanks were lost
on D-Day alone and more than 200 in Operation Goodwood in July. The August
figure has apparently been corrected to arrive at the total for the first three months
of the campaign.
A report prepared by RAC for its Liaison Letter to 2ist Army group shows
losses to s August, which when combined with First Canadian and British Second
Army tanks knocked out in the period 6-26 August gives the total of Allied tanks
knocked out as follows:

Therefore almost 2,700 Allied tanks were knocked out or written off in the
Normandy campaign, of which nearly 1,700 were British. The British total is ap-
proximately 25 per cent higher than the previously accepted total as per the RAC
Progress Report for tanks lost by 2tst Army Group. The difference in the two totals
is because the RAC Progress Report gave tanks written off and did not include
those knocked out and repaired, which are included in the RAC Liaison Letter.
Another example of this type of dual reporting was an earlier report prepared by
the RAC for the Wastage Rates committee, which gave tank losses after six weeks
of fighting to 20 July as:
• Shermans - 931 knocked out of which 493 were write offs with 297 of the
remainder having been repaired
• Churchills - 140 knocked out with eighty-one written off and thirty-nine of the
remainder having been repaired
• Cromwells - 20s knocked out with eighty-one being written off and forty-three
of the remainder having been repaired 2

Summary
This report gives a total of 1,276 British tanks knocked out to the 20 July before
tie ey losses of August 1944, which is again higher than the Progress Report.
In reality, by the end of July the effective wastage rate for the month for Sherman
quped units was 35 per cent of the unit entitlement and much higher than the
janed 2, per cent rate. A shortage of Sherman tanks developed as only 246 had
tem shipped to Normandy to replace the 493 written off. One of the factors
chening the planning of Operation Goodwood was the ready availability of
there tanks, yet by the end of the month the British had a shortage of tanks
because of the Goodwood losses.
Another way of examining total British tank-osses is to look at the numbers of
pacement lanks suppled. Total issues from Corps and army denvery syudstons
in the 2nd Armoured Replacement Group of the 2ist Army Group from june to
hugust were as follows:

A total of 1,567 replacement tanks were issit a to the field Denvery squadrons
during the campaign, which is again higher than the RAC Progress Report.
A small proportion of the tanks issued would have been for mechanical break-
downs, so the total of tanks issued corresponds well with the total 1,667 knocked
out or destroyed in the campaign; most armoured units were still understrength at
le end of August 1944 owing to the shortage of replacement shermans.
American tank losses were also considerably higher than forecast and by mid-
August there were no reserves of M4 tanks left at all. A replacement factor of
7 per cent of unit strengths had been used by the War Department for planning
before the invasion and the actual losses from combat were of cent which
caused reserves to be rapidly used up. This depletion was accelerated in July by the
emergency transfer to the British of 388 M4 tanks to meet their losses. Attempts
by the AFV section at FUSA to have the transfer to the British cancelled and to
procur more tanks were refused by the War Department, which only agreed to
raise the replacement factor to 9 per cent on i5 August. As a consequence, most US
tank units were only at 75-87 per cent of full strength for most of September and
October. 4 The greater than expected American losses culminated in the borrow-
ing back of 350 tanks from the British in December after the Ardennes Offensive
and all Sherman shipments to the British being suspended from January 1945 to
channel all tank production to US units.
