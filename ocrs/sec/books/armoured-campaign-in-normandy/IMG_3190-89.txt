Battle of the Hedgerows
The US and Armored Division had fought in North Africa and Sicily, and was
the only unit of the USA Armored Force in Normandy to have seen action apart
from the 7oth Tank Battalion. The first elements of the division came ashore in
france on Omaha beach on 9 June 1944 after one LST carrying men and vehicles
of the division hit a mine in the English Channel and sank.' Seven men were killed
or went mising and sixty-six were wounded; seventeen medium M4 tanks and
fourteen Ms light tanks were lost and another medium tank of D Company was
drowned when it drove off its LST into deep water? After removing the water-
proofing materials, the men and vehicles of Combat Command A were the first
to atrive at their assembly point near Mosles, which was in the V Corps sector to
the west of Carentan. They had assembled by midnight. The area around Carentan
had been defended by the paratroopers of the US roist Airborne Division since
D-Day and supplies and ammunition were running low. The American beachhead
vas at its narrowest at Carentan and was therefore the most vulnerable part of the
American frontline; the capture of Carentan was vital in order for the Omaha and
Utah beachheads to be joined.
By 12 June, the and Armored Division's CCB (Combat Command B) had
also landed and was assembling around Littry and Lemolay while CCA (Combat
Command A) had received orders to take up positions south of Carentan for an
attack next day. The task for CCA was to hold the bridge over the River Vire at
ligny and link up with the units of the torst Airborne in the area, offering support
Where required. During the previous night, the Germans, also running low on am-
munition, had withdrawn from Carentan to a new defensive line to the south and
US paratroopers were able to occupy the town that morning.
That night, the First
United States Army (FUSA) commander, General Bradley, had also received Ultra
intelligence and aerial reconnaissance reports of a German build-up for a counterat-
tack and he consequently ordered General Gerow to move a battalion of tanks into
the area to support the paratroopers?
After moving out at 0322 hours, the and battalion
of the
66th Armored
Regiment, with a battalion of armoured infantry from the 4ist Infantry Regiment,
