The Americans investigated the possibility of sourcing some Firefly tanks from
the British but this did not come about as British production was at full Capay
converting enough Shermans to Fireflies for their own use. Montgomery even
stipulated that top priority would be given to ensuring that the tank regiments hac
two Fireflies per troop as soon as possible."4
Panther. Each panzer division had one Panther tank battalion and one Mark IV
1he Germans in Normandy had two main battle tanks: the Mark IV and the
battalion, the intention being to ultimately phase out the Mark IVs. The Mark IV
tank had been in service since 1937 and was originally conceived as an infantry
upport tank with a short-barrelled 7smm howitzer as the Mark III tank was the
main tank at that time. With the invasion f Russia, the Germans encountered the
T-34 and the heavily armoured KV-I, the existence of which came as a great shock
and there was an urgent need for the Germans to up-gun and up-armour their
anks. The Mark ill Was too small to be equipped with any gun larger man
in calibre, so the Mark IV was up-guired from a howitzer to an anti-tank gi
Com mid-1942 onwards. The long-barrelled Mark IV came to be known as the
Mark IV 'special' in North Africa. By May 1944, most of the Mark IVs in France
were theY variant, which was equipped with a 75mm KwK L/48 gun and in many

cases an additional smm of skirt armour on the sides of the hull and turret for extra
protection. This extra armour made the Mark IV look larger than it was, and many
Allied tank crews mistook it for a Tiger tank throughout the campaign.
Following the arrival of the Sherman in North Africa in the second half of 1942
that temporarily gave the Allies parity with German tanks, the next two years saw
the Germans introduce a new heavy tank and a new medium tank, the Tiger and
Panther respectively.
The Tiger was a heavy tank that had been in development before the war
to replace the Mark IV. The development work was given new impetus by the
successful production by Krupp of a tank gun based on the famous 88mm Flak
gun and the encounters with the T-34 and KV-i on the Eastern front. The Tiger
made its combat debut in late 1942 at Leningrad and, with its heavy armour and
enormous firepower, quickly earned a deadly reputation. Fortunately, given its
weight, complexity and cost, the Germans did not produce many Tigers, and they
required frequent maintenance to keep them operational. The Germans organised
the Tigers in independent battalions of forty-five tanks.
A Tiger tank was knocked out in North Africa by a 6-pounder anti-tank gun,
and the British mistakenly got the impression that there was not much to fear
from the tank. When the tank was shipped to England for trials, RAC reports
as to its superior performance set alarm bells ringing in some quarters. Such was
the reputation of the Tiger on the battlefields of Italy and Normandy that senior
Allied commanders from Montgomery down were concerned about tank crews
developing 'Tiger phobia'. "5
The Panther tank was developed as a direct response to Russian tanks and
was largely modelled on the T-34 with sloped armour, a powerful gun and wide
tracks for a good cross-country performance. The tank was developed and put
into production within eighteen months of a specification being issued and 250
tanks were deployed at Kursk in 1943, although their deployment was rushed and
there was little time for trials. The Panther's combat debut was not successful:
many tanks broke down or caught fire whilst others were not well deployed and
became bogged. This debut was ironic as the start of the battle had been delayed
for the arrival of the Panther tanks, allowing the Russians more time to build their
defences. The initial problems were eventually ironed out and the Panther became
renowned on the Eastern front. The Mark III tank battalions in each division
were progressively replaced by Panther battalions for the ten months before D-Day.
A few Panthers were deployed in Italy, but by and large, the British and Americans
had no experience of fighting them and assumed it was a tank that would be used in
small units like the Tiger!" The realisation that the Panther tank was a main battle
tank did not come until early in 1944 when the British discovered that Panthers
would replace all Mark IVs."7
The German anti-tank gun ammunitiy. 1 was also largely flashless and smoke-
less (unlike British ammunition), which helped their tanks and anti-tans guns to
remain concealed once they opened fire. In the close count side or te endandy
