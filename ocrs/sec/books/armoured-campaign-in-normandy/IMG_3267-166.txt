The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
them to be moved from Caen to meet this attack, which had the fortunate outcome
of severely reducing their combat strengths.
Operation Bluecoat saw the dismissal of the XXX Corps commander Bucknall
and the commander of the 7th Armoured Division, Erskine. But these were nor
the last of the changes within the 7th Armoured Division, now commanded by
General Verney. On 7 August, Brigadier Hinde was removed from command and
there followed a series of meetings and conferences with the officers and men to
discuss morale and tank problems.
On to August, General Verney visited the 22nd Brigade and next day General
Horrocks of XXX Corps addressed the officers and COs of all regiments. Later
in the day, Brigadier Fisher and Major-General Briggs from RAC also visited 22nd
Brigade to discuss personnel and issues with Cromwell tanks.
Two days later, on 13 August, there was a further conference for 22nd Brigade
HQ and 7th Armoured Division HQ with Major-General Richards from the RAC
at 2ist Army Group regarding personnel problems. Finally, 100 officers and men
were posted out of the 7th Armoured Division." Forty of these men were from the
sth RTR. The ist RTR also received a new commander on 17 August.
In response to these changes, the absentee rate at the 7th Armoured Division
increased dramatically. Twenty-four men were convicted of desertion, drunken-
ness or insubordination in August compared with four the previous months."
However, General Verney was unable to turn the division around and retained the
post for only four months until November. His impression of the division was nor
a favourable one:
There is no doubt that familiarity with war does not make one more courageous.
One becomes cunning, and from cunning to cowardice is but one short step. The
infantryman who does not want to have a go' can find opportunities for lying low
at the critical moment, the tank man can easily find a fault in his engine or wireless
and thus miss taking part in the battle. This is a disease that spreads rapidly. The com-
mander who finds his men getting canny' soon losses his confidence and becomes
nervy himself. If he happens to also have done a lot of fighting and especially if he has
been 'brewed up' in his tank once or twice himself, he gets slow and delberal, an
Is quite unable to take advantage of a situation that requires dash and enterprise. This
Is a most important point in an armoured division which exists to exploit a favourable
situation quickly.
The 7th Armoured and sist highland were extremely swollen headed. shey were
a law unto themselves, they thought they need only obey orders that suited them ....
both these divisions did badly from the moment they landed in Normandy."
The 7th Armoured Division's initial recklessness in Normandy had given way to
excessive caution and a poor performance. This caution resulted from the division's
reaction to both German tank superiority and effectiveness of 88mm anti-tank
guns as reported by General Erskine after Villers Bocage.7°

Any criticism of 7th Armoured Division needs to be put into context, however.
The division had seen service in three theatres since 194I and was fighting in very
unfamiliar and difficult countryside for which no Allied units had trained:
Montgomery had asked too much of the 7th Armoured and that the amount of time
it had spent in action was blatantly unfair when compared, for example, to the Guards
Armoured Division?'
The lesson of the need for good infantry/tank co-operation had to be learnt by
the 7th Armoured Division as it had to be by every other armoured formation in
Normandy.
The Desert Rats continued to view the Cromwell tanks with great suspicion
although they performed well in the pursuit after Normandy. The division was
heartened temporarily in August by the appearance of a few Challenger tanks
(modified Cromwells fitted with a 17-pounder gun) although a few weeks later the
Challengers had to be handed over to the reconnaissance regiment, which had no
Fireflies. A promise by the RAC to supply the first new Comet tanks was not kept,
with the tanks going to the lIth Armoured Division.
