The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
backloaded to third or fourth line workshops for long term repair. The remaining
25 per cent were either destroyed or had brewed up and were unrepairable?"
The Germans operated a very similar system to the Allies, categorising the dam-
age by the estimated amount of time to repair. Light damage was categorised as
that requiring 16 hours or less to repair and included repairs to tracks, the drive
train, steering and electrical work that did not require the removal of the gun or
turret and was carried out by a battalion workshop. Medium damage requiring the
removal of gun, turret or engine estimated to take from 16-60 hours was done at
a division workshop. Any work forecast to take longer than 6o hours was done at
an army tank workshop or repair battalion and in the severest cases, shipped back
to Germany? As the Allies were slowly advancing, they were in most cases in pos-
session of the battlefield, which made it very difficult for the Germans to recover
knocked out or damaged tanks. If recovery could be done at all, it was done either
under fire or at night; often immobilised tanks were towed from the battlefield by
other tanks.
