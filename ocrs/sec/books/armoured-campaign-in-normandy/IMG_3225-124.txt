The Armoured Campaign in Normandy, June-August 1944
The reaction of the CIGS to the results of Operation Goodwood is not recorded
in his normally meticulous diaries. Indeed, Brooke that day was more concerned
about rehabilitating Montgomery in the eyes of Winston Churchill, who believed
that Montgomery had banned him from visiting Normandy?" Brooke retrieved the
situation by flying to see Montgomery on 20 July and dictated an apologetic letter for
him to send to Churchill. Suitably mollified, Churchill finally visited Montgomery
(and Eisenhower) on 22-23 July; no recriminations were targeted at Montgomery
who smoothed the way with a gift of a bottle of vintage brandy to Churcill. In
discussions with Eisenhower, Churchill was apparently content with the situation.
In private, Eisenhower was far more explicit, raging after Churchill's visit that
"Monty had sold Winston a bill of goods.??® Montgomery was suffering the fallout:
from his ambitious promises to Eisenhower and SHAEF and for failing to keep
Eisenhower fully informed. Montgomery's relationship with Eisenhower was it-
retrievably damaged and their differences continued in respective memoirs and
articles long after the war had ended.
Tank Losses
The actual tank losses during the battle are difficult to determine from the records
that have survived the battle.
The main reference used by many historians is the
Military Operations Unit (MORU) report No. 23 prepared in October 1940,
which gives the daily losses for all the armoured brigades and their reconnaissance
regiments for the four days of the battle. According to the MORU report, a total
of 493 tanks were admaged, knocked out or destroyed and this das see tele te
accepted figure of 500 tanks lost.

Operation Goodwood
229
From the MORU study data for the three armoured divisions, the total 'R' casual-
ties are 33I tanks with another 104 damaged.
The MORU report indicates that the Guards Armoured Division reported
sixty-five tanks lost on 18 July and then continued to report losses of twenty-five
and twenty-seven tanks for the next two days, even when the tank regiments were
not in combat. As the armoured regiments disengaged and there was more time
tor a better assessment of casualties and damage, the more accurate figures were
reported. However, the MORU report does not recognise this and merely totals
the unit's reported daily tank states so that in some instances tank losses have been
counted twice.
Post-war historians and authors have also made errors that have subsequently
become held as truths over the years.
An VIII Corps report claims that the
and Northants Yeomanry lost thirty-seven tanks on the second day of the bat-
tle, as does Dalglish?" However,
the second day's figure is the two-day total
loses for the regiment as confirmed in the regiment history and tith Armoured
Division reports.
The actual losses of the Guards Armoured Division have been hard to determine
from war diaries and many official divisional histories have also not provided much
detail, even when written by serving officers. Most authors have not distinguished
between tanks merely knocked out and tanks written off, which has added to the
confusion.
Servicing the Guards Armoured Division, the 268th Field Delivery Squadron
supplied twenty-four Shermans,
five Cromwells and three Ms Stuarts between
19 and 25 July 1944 so it can be assumed these were direct replacements for those
tanks written off. The Guards Armoured Division REME commander's report
details the tanks lost in Operation Goodwood as follows:
• Zw - (destroyed and burnt) - sixteen
• Z - damaged, major repairs required in 3rd echelon workshops - nineteen
• Y - repairable longer than 24 hours - thirty-one
Therefore the Guards Armoured Division lost thirty-five tanks as Z casualties and
thirty-one tanks were damaged for a total of sixty ax khocked out." A further
twelve 'X' (repairable within 24 hours)
casualties were
repaired by regimental
LADS.
In the heavy rain after the battle, it took the REME some time to examine
all the knocked-out vehicles and much information was lost as two legmenta
adjutants had become casualties themselves. Using regiment war diaries and official
reports, a more accurate summary can be put together.
As can be seen in the table below, the total number of tanks destroyed or disabled
for more than 24 hours was 213 with an estimated further sixty-two X casualties
for a total of 275, which is a lot lower than the MORU report and other previous
estimates.
