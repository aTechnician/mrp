The British Cabinet history, after quotird; the MORU report, then gives a re-
vised figure of 1s6 tanks lost, which is the number of tanks in the Zw category
and thus totally written off. The bulk of these losses were in the 29th Brigade
of the lith Armoured Division, which had reported Ild tanks knocked oul, with
eighty-five of these being in the Z category. This was the equivalent of two entire
armoured regiments being lost. The DDME Operation Goodwood report for the
rith Armoured Division gave the total tanks knocked out or damaged as roi with
forty of these being A casualties lepaired by regiment LADs, so the civision dad
I21 tanks knocked out, which corresponds with the 29th Brigade report.
German losses have been researched by historians such as Niklas vetering and
Wolfgang
Schnieder.
The major difficulty with German tank casualties is the
Panzertruppen policy of not writing off any recovered tanks in long-term repair as
being lost to enemy action. German losses between 17 and 21 July were as follows.$3
• 2Ist Panzer Division ... twenty-eight Panzer IVs (twenty-two recovered by the
British from the bombed area around Manneville)
• Ist SS Panzer Division ... twenty-six Panthers and sixteen Stug Ills damaged of
lost around Bourguébus and Soliers
Operation Goodwood
231
• sord Schwere Tank Battalion ... seven Tiger Is and three Tiger IIs®+
• T0Tst SS Schwere Tank Battalion ... three Tiger Is
The total of German armoured vehicles lost or damaged in Operation Goodwood
was therefore eighty-three tanks and self-propelled guns,
almost the strength of
an entire panzer division at that time in Normandy. Montgomery had certainly
achieved one of his objectives, of writing down German armour. With few replace-
ments reaching the panzer divisions, this loss brought the situation in Normandy to
a critical state for the Germans.
Casualties
One of the significant planning factors of Operation Goodwood was the high
mantry casualty rate sustained to that point in the Normandy campaign and the
toming shortage of infantry replacements, coupled with a surplus of tanks build-
ing up in the beachhead ordnance parks. Post-war, Dempsey claimed that the loss
of s00 tanks was not unreasonable and he was prepared to lose many more." In
reality, 275 tanks were lost or damaged and inianty castates fated, wounded ot
missing) were as follows:
• I Corps 1,656
• VIII Corps 1,818
• XII Corps 449
• 2nd Canadian Corps 1,614
Therefore the total of men killed, wounded or missing during the period of
Uperation Goodwood, 18-22 July, was 5,537, including the umited tank and
diversionary actions taking place elsewhere.* As the total cumulative losses of the
21s Army Group from D-Day to 22 July were 45.795, Operation Goodwood was
responsible for a further 12 per cent of British Second Army casualties, hardly the
preservation of infantry said to be so dear to Montgomery and Dempsey. Clearly,
Operation Goodwood failed in its objective of casualty minimisation. However,
Dempsey did not acknowledge this in his post-war interview with Wilmot:
Our tank losses were severe but our casualties in men were very light. If I had tried to
achieve the same result with a conventional infantry attack, I hate to think what the
casualties would have been. 87
Note that the MORU report into Operation Goodwood gives total casualties of
4,0rr killed, wounded or missing, which is still 8.76 per cent of the total Normandy
casualties to 22 July. RAC casualties in the armoured divisions (excluding infantry)
were as follows:
