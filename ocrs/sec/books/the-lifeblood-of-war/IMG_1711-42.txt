At last, with the advent of the vehicle powered by the internal
combustion engine, armies had the ability to supply themselves well
away from ports and railheads. Before examining how armies made
use of this new flexibility in a war of vastly greater scope than that of
1914-18, it is worth glancing at one sideshow in a remote corner,
Where conditions favoured mobile operations; and where the logistic
perception of a junior officer was to have an effect out of all
proportion to the size and skill of the force at his disposal; the place,
Arabia, then part of the Ottoman Empire, and the force, the Arabs
who had rebelled against their colonial masters. The Turks garri-
soned Medina in present day Saudi Arabia, at the extremity of the
Hejaz railway, 600 miles from Amman. Faced with the prospect of a
fruitless assault on the strongly held town, the British Colonel
T. E. Lawrence, advised the Emir Faisal leading the Arab forces in
rebellion against the Turks, to turn their attention to the Turkish
lifeline, and destroy the railway. So successful was this tactic, that
25,000 Turkish troops were pinned down to blockhouses and posts
along the railway, and the garrison at Medina totally neutralised.
There were to be more, and greater operations of this kind in the
Second World War and others that followed.
