The Lifeblood of War
battle-worthy. There were no operational Warrior AIFVs and only
about 10 running Challengers left in the whole of Rhine Army, not to
mention a host of other equipment left useless by cannibalisation.
Herein lies a lesson for the
future. Only those forces that are
demonstrably capable of conducting sustained operations at the end of
long lines of communications will be of the smallest use in deterring
threats posed by latter-day adventurers on the international scene.
This has been a new kind of war. A war in which technology brought
unprecedented levels of accuracy in both airborne and ground-based
weapons, new levels of destructive power and, above all, a revolution in
the availability of information to the Allied commanders. Finally, what
many feared would prove a weakness, the development of strategic and
tactical plans for the command and control of a force containing
elements of so many nations, was to prove a triumph-the credit for
which must finally go to their dynamic commander described by
Lieutenant General Sir Peter de la Billiere as 'the man of the match'.
Behind all this however, lay the necessity for immense logistic
support—the lifeblood of war.
