The Lifeblood of War
120 WESSEX Sorties
20 x CHINOOK sorties
One pallet of 105 mm light gun ammo contains 24 complete rounds
SEA KING will carry 2 x pallets =48 rounds
WESSEX will carry 1 x pallet = 24 rounds
CHINOOK will carry 6 x pallets = 144 rounds
Some example time and distance figures:
1. Distance San Carlos to Mount Kent gun positions flying tactically = 50 miles
(40 miles in a straight line).
2. Turn-round time with underslung loads, including refuelling from one-spot
decks in San Carlos Water = 1.5 hours.
3. First light 06.30 hours, last light 16.15 hrs.
4. Therefore, maximum number of sorties per day per hel = 7(1).
5. 6 SEA KINGS x 7 sorties =42 lifts per day.
6. Therefore to lift one battery plus ammunition takes all available SEA KINGS
two days.
Notes:
(1) Unlikely because of weather. Also, return trip of last sortie will be after last
light see below:

22. The 30 days stocks for Sth Infantry Brigade were put together by Headquarters
United Kingdom Land Forces, and placed in a variety of ships. Although the
Commanding Officer of the Commando Logistic Regiment was sent a signal telling
him what had been loaded where, the Navy had busily cross-loaded much of it in
and around South Georgia, and were never able to tell him where anything wss,
rom then on.

13. Compare this with the situation of a Soviet general commanding a front—
the
equivalent of a NATO army group. Although the example is taken from the
Second World War, those who have made a close study of Soviet methods believe
that they would operate in the same way now, with the necessary adaptations to fit
the situation. (See Map XIII-taken from Operationaya Maskirovka Voysk by
Matsulenko, translated by Lieutenant Colonel Blandy).
As part of the Soviet exploitation of their victory at Kursk (July 1943), the
commander of the Voronezh Front (Vatutin), was ordered to attack in a south-
westerly direction to break into the salient round Kharkov held by German Army
Group South. Although there was plenty of railway track (some 856 km), in the
sector allocated to Vatutin, all the lines ran laterally. There was not one railway
track or road running direct to where Vatutin's Front, consisting of eight armies,
was to mount the attack. The only line that ran in the right direction (Kastornaya-
Kursk-L'gov) was outside his sector and belonged to Rokossosyky's Central
Front. However, by a prodigious effort of rail and road construction, the most
important being the linking of the lateral rail system between Stariy Oskol and
Rzdava, the distance from army bases was reduced by 184 km.
This cut the
movement times of trains from about two to three days to between 10 and 15 hours;
doubling the supply capacity to the Front. As the Front advanced over terrain
devastated by the Germans, six roads were built behind the advancing armies, to
ensure that supply could keep pace
More remarkable, Vatutin took advantage of the lateral layout of the railway, to
mount an elaborate deception plan. For several days before the operation began,
trains steamed north-west on the line running to Sudzha and Lokinskaya loaded
with troops, dummy stores and equipment, including tanks. Every night the trains
returned with the troops, leaving the equipment and stores. This led the Germans
into believing that a Guards Tank Army and a Tank Army were concentrating to
mount the Front's main blow in a westerly and north-westerly direction. In fact,
the main blow was actually on the south-westerly Belgorod-Kharkov axis.
Deception (Maskirovka) is an important ingredient in any Soviet planning at
operational level, and considerable pains are taken to make the bait more
palatable.
The switching of a NATO army group axis, let alone a deception plan based on a
logistic dumping programme, would be beyond the capability of the layer-cake of
national corps, each tied to their own line of communication carrying their largely
non-interoperable range of ammunition and equipment.

16. The principal differences in the national systems for ammunition supply are:
(a) Demanding procedures for ammunition, i.e., automatic or demand.
(b) Methods of supply, i.e., 'PUSH' or 'PULL' or a combination.
(c) The chain used for ammunition supply is often separate from other classes of
SUDULY.
Methods of determining initial and replenishment stocks.
(e) Structure, organisation and manpower of ammunition units.
(f) Responsibilities and tasks of units in the ammunition supply system.
Differences in the supply of the various natures of ammunition, e.g., artillery,
Mines and Explosives.
(h) Alternative systems for urgent resupply
(i) Extent of the use of Automatic Data
