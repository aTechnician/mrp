The Lifeblood of War
envisaged in Note 9 above, but is more like an airportable brigade 1990 style. This
enabled the figures to be validated by British Aerospace using data based on in-
service, or existing equipment. The brigade consisting of 2,500 men, 5 light
helicopters, 12 attack helicopters, 3,915 tonnes of freight, and 1,000 vehicles
(including trailers, and light APCs) could be complete in Turkey by D plus 3 days
18 hours, taking 362 sorties. As a comparison, even using the C-130 J, still on the
drawing board, but an improved version of the present C-130 H, this same lift
would require 647 sorties by 65 aircraft and would not be complete until D plus
10 days 6 hours.
If the attack helicopters flew under their own power, the lift would be completed
even quicker. The Apache AH-64A equipped with four drop tanks can fly
UK-Western Turkey non-stop. So even if the brigade had its full establishment of
attack helicopters (60), as in Note 9 above, their move would not impose further
demands on the airlift. If the brigade was entirely heliborne (Note 9 above), the
Blackhawks would replace many of the 1,000 vehicles in the FLA Tactran lift, and
any attached logistic Chinooks could fly direct using AAR.
Airlift 2
The
organisation of the parachute brigade in this operation is nearer that
envisaged by the author, but has fewer light mechanised vehicles and more wheeled
vehicles and towed equipments to allow the figures to be validated. It consists of:
2,000 men
sent mechanisca venicies.
70 wheeled vehicles
55 trailers and towed equipment
2 light helicopters
LAn-04h Anache
128 tonnes of ammunition on pallets
Is tonnes or stores on pallets
with a daily resupply requirement of 64 tonnes of ammunition and 37 tonnes of
ourer stotes.
The assault is to be in three phases:
Phase One
Parachute assault by two battalions totalling 600 men to seize 3,000 foot strip.
Phase Two
On the strip seized in Phase One, airland 10 light mechanised vehicles
(Scimitar type) and crews, and 2 light helicopters. AH-64As start arriving
direct from U.K. each fitted with 2 external fuel tanks, & Heilfire missiles, 4
Stinger missiles, 1,200 rounds 30 mm.
Phase Three
Starting at H plus 45 minutes, airland:
1,400 men
15 light mechanised vehicles
70 wheeled vehicles
5 trallers towed equipments
52 ammunition pallets
36 stores pallets
Phases Two and Three would be complete within 2 hours and 50 minutes of the
Phase One drop, using 52 sorties of FLA Tactran. By comparison the C130-J
would require 102 sorties and 8 hours 46 minutes to complete the same task.
Phase Four
Daily fly-in of 101 tonnes of ammunition and stores, requiring 5 FLA Tactran
sorties, compared with 7 C-130J sorties.

Airlift 3
This requires a daily lift of 400 tonnes of logistic stocks to be flown 400 nautical
miles, carried out concurrently with Airlift 1. It could be accomplished by 3 FLA
Tactran in 24 sorties. By comparison, 5 C-130J would need 34 sorties to complete
the same task
All these ambitious tasks could be carried out by FLA Tactran with capacity to
spare for the unforeseen, because on completion of Airlift 1, there would be lift
available for 9,600 tonnes per day over a 400 nautical mile radius, or 2,160 tonnes
per day over a 2,350 nautical mile radius. At the same point, there would be no
spare capacity offered by a C-130J fleet.
The figures above and comparisons of FLA Tactran with C-130J assume the
following:
(a) 65 aircraft in the FLA Tactran or C-130J fleets.
(b) Daily availability of aircraft:
C-130J: 78 per cent (assumed 8 per cent improvement over current C-130)
FLA: 90 per cent (1990s technology, better serviceability etc.)
(c) Cruise speed (mean)
C-130J 300 knots
FLA 400 knots
