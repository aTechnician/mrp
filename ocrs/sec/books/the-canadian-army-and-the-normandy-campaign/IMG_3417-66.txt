of 1942, Staff College Camberley was organized in three wings (RG 24, Vol. 9874).
Seventeen-week courses designed to train second-grade staff officers for field army
headquarters (awarding an "sc"
qualification) were conducted at Camberley and
Haifa staff colleges. Ten to 13-week junior staff courses designed to train staff officers
for non-field grade two positions (with the qualification "js") were conducted at
Sandhurst, Sarafand, and Quetta.
An 18-week "sc" course was also run at Quetta
(RG 24, Vol. 9874, WO DMT 43/SC/S662 (MT1), 16 April 1944 and File 2/Staff/7-

rather slow, but he shows sound sense and a good judgement." He was assessed as
competent to perform "in a third grade appointment" [RG 24, Vol. 186, Third (and
final) report on Maj. J. V. Allard, 12 Army Tk Bn (TRR). See also The Memoirs
of General Jean V. Allard, written in cooperation with Serge Bernier (Vancouver:
University of British Columbia Press, 1988), Pp. 36-37, 44-45. Allard went on to
head Canada's peacetime forces in the intoxicating days of unification and latter
stages of Quebec's "Quiet Revolution.

reluctance of officers to leave the regimental family chiefly accounted for the low-

Battle Drill Die
Early in 42 the Canadian Army in England went Battle Drill mad.
Assault courses. lanachamunition exercises and speed marches domi-
nated the lives of all infantrymen and impinged on those in other corps.
Training had become boring. For two years, in the case of some of us,
batrack square routine and large scale manoeuvres... had started to
turn us into a fed-up, browned-off, disillusioned band of volunteer
warriors. We were getting to the point where we couldn't have fought
our way out of a paper bag
Strome Galloway, The General Who Never Was'
At several removes from staff organization and functioning, the Anglo-
Canadian training phenomenon known as battle drill merits attention for
at least two reasons. First, because it encapsulated the general thrust, pulse,
and hence effectiveness of Canadian Army training at the lower level, and
secondly, because it may have been a pedagogical dead end. The speed and
enthusiasm with which Canadians embraced battle drill, of course, seems
more reminiscent of a fad than any deliberate direction on the part of their
high command. One can only speculate that Canadians as a group may
have too eagerly seized unon new methods merely to escape having to learn
older proven ways with which they were larrely unfamiliar It thus remains
