by GOC-in-C First Cdn Army 051100, August 1944. The Battle of Amiens, which
began at 0430 hours, 8 August 1918, was the greatest Allied triumph since the
Marne. The Canadian and Australian Corps carried out the main attack under cover
of a creeping barrage by 2,000 guns lifting 100 yards every three minutes.
captured three lines of objectives in a decisive action.
Although the battle officially
ended on 11 August, Ludendorff called 8 August the "black day of the German
Army" in the history of the war [J.F.C. Fuller,

World 1792-1944, ed. John Terraine (London: Paladin, 1981), pp. 373-384).

Officer at army headquarters, who put them into the RAF signals system. This was
in stark contrast to the close communication that existed down to brigade level with
aircraft of 84 Group of the 2nd Tactical Air Force, providing close air support to
ground forces. [Reginald H. Roy, 1944: The Canadians in Normandy (Ottawa: Mac-

for either." See also Stacey, Victory Cam-
paign. pp. 203-204, 214, 220-221, 232-233. The intelligence picture at this time was
not clear. On 22 June, the 272nd Division supported by the 503rd Heavy Tank
Battalion straddled the Orne between Maltot to the west and Verrières; from Ver-
The Amiens Alchemy
rières east to La Hogue, the 1st SS Panzer held the line. As a result of "Spring,"
however, the 272nd and 503rd were moved to the area east and south of Cagny.
The Ith SS Panzer Division west of Maltot now stretched east to cover the gap left
by the 272nd. At the beginning of August, however, the 9th SS moved west with
the 21st Panzer and the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion to participate in the counter-
attack at Mortain. The front was again reorganized with the 277th and 271st Di-
visions taking over west of the Orne and the Ist SS the sector between the Orne
and La Hogue, from which the 272nd extended to Emieville.
The 12th SS now
withdrew into a reserve position on the River Laison. On the night of 4/5 and 5/6
August, the 1st SS also crept quietly away to Mortain, its place being taken by the
89th division, which deployed its 1055 and 1056 grenadier regiments left and right,
respectively (BAOR Battlefield Tour, pp. 5-7, 10, 37).
21. CP, Vol. 2, Simonds to Crerar, 6 August 1944. Specific figures on German
tank and SP gun strengths vary with every account. Stacey used German sources
to state that when "Totalize" was launched, the 12th SS had 48 tanks, 37 of them
Mark IVs with long 75-mm guns, nine Panthers, and two unidentified. They also
had 19 Tigers from the 101st SS Heavy Tank Battalion and 88-mm guns in some
number from the 3rd Flak Corps (Stacey, Victory Campaign, p. 221).

that in certain circumstances the tanks of a troop could be as close to each other as
20 yards, "but such density wals exceptional." In open country it prescribed that
tanks not normally be more than 100 yards from each other.
