significant differences in text and references, the original is separately cited.

Stewart,
"Attack Doctrine," p. 225; and Nicholson, Canadian Expeditionary Force,
pp. 404, 429, 432, 435-438. The Canadian Corps often fired more than double the
amount of ammunition expended by British formations. McNaughton's views of
the limited effectiveness of indirect machine-gun barrage fire in the Great War appear
at variance with those expressed by Hutchinson, Bidwell, and Graham. See also
Capt. Bruce I. Gudmundsson,
"The Lost Art of Indirect Machine Gun Fire," Marine
Corps Gazette, 9 (September 1988): 43-44. Brutinel deserves more attention. See

commonplace pre-war British press phraseology that claimed German trade policy
aimed at gaining the British Empire by "peaceful penetration."
