Chapter 4
The Staff Caste
The ... General Staff [acts] as a nervous system animating the lumbering
body of the army, making possible that articulation and flexibility which
alone render... it an effective military force.
Michael Howard, The Franco-Prussian War'
In order to gain a better insight into the operational functioning of a modern
army, it is first necessary to acquire a knowledge of staff organization and
training. The staff converts the ideas of a commander into orders and by
working out all details related to their execution frees his mind to deal with
other, more important, matters. At the other end of the spectrum, the staff
remains responsible for watching over the fighting condition and material
welfare of the troops.? Thus, if the chain of command can be said to drive
the fighting arms and their supporting services, then the staff can be con-
sidered its lubricant. As John Masters has so succinctly put it, the staff solves
problems related to people, things, and fighting.
Working on behalf of a
commander and his troops, it coordinates the activities of the whole through
meticulous planning and detailed direction so as to avoid sending ammu-
nition and "rations to Rome if the ... [army is] attacking Paris.
Since a staff also serves an educational function and provides the primary
avenue by which an army can prepare for war in peace, one might expect
it to be a more studied subject in its own right. Surprisingly, however, not
all that much has been written out staff, which in the Canadian case is
stil largely an unexplored field. This chapter thus represents an attempt to
delve deeper into the caff exerience of Canadae Second World War army.
