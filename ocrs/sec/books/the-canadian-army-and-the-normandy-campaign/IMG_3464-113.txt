was gallingly superficial in its thrust: to "aim at maximum surprise, as well
as maximum fire power." The last three pages were also extracts,
taken
directly from an address given by Crerar on 14 May 1944, itself a patchwork
effort taken almost verbatim from paragraphs in previous letters and mem-
oranda. All told they remain more revealing of a commander who never
had an original idea of his own than they were stimulating. Indeed, the
narrow emphasis placed upon the employment of barrage fire and the ne-
cessity for infantry-"deploy[ed] in width, rather than in depth" —to keep
close to it during the "Break-in" battle even suggested a trench warfare
mentality. The use of armor was by comparison hardly mentioned, except
in the most general sense. 48 On the whole, Crerar's directive, especially in
its non-artillery facets, suffered from vagueness and superficiality.
In a larger sense the foregoing incident seems to confirm a persistent lack
of judgment, if not tactical naiveté, on the part of Crerar. Montgomery,
by now practiced in settling disputes among senior Canadian commanders,
expressed his exasperation in a letter to Brooke on 26 July:
Harry Crerar has started off his career as an Army Comd by thoroughly
upsetting everyone; he had a row with Crocker the first day, and asked me
to remove Crocker. I have spent two days trying to restore peace; investigating
the quarrel, and so on. As always, there are faults on both sides. But the basic
cause was Harry; I fear he thinks he is a great soldier, and he was determined
to show it the very moment he took over command at 1200 hrs 23 July. He
made his first mistake at 1205 hrs; and his second after lunch. I have had each
of them to see me-separately of course. I have told Harry in quite clear terms
that in my opinion the basic fault lies with him, in this quarrel. I have seen
Crocker, and told him he must play 100%.... I now hope I can get on with
fighting the Germans-instead of stopping the Generals fighting amongst
themselves. 4
According to the late Brigadier Richard Simpkin, a key element in the
offective central direction of a field army is "an unbroken chain of trust and
mutual respect running from the controlling operational commander to the
tank or section commander. "5" As can be seen, however, this was hardly
the case in the First Canadian Army as Crerar assumed command. Part of
the problem was doubtless of his own making, a result of his inability to
recognize operational talent when it stared him in the face. At the same
time, the half-generation gap that existed within the Canadian high com-
mand further signified a relative lack of depth. By way of comparison, the
youngest U.S. corps commander, Major-General J. Lawton Collins, was
seven years older than Simonds; in the German army, moreover, less than
two percent of corps commanders were under 45!51
When all evidence is
weighed, nonetheless, it is difficult to dispute Montgomery's assessment of
Crerar, which in respect of First Canadian Army deployment was a con-
sequential factor. Indeed, the once leaderless army had gained little in the

way of stature with its new head. While noting on 24 June that Bradley
and Dempsey were both "first class ... Army [Commanders] and... very
willing to learn," Montgomery wrote: "I have grave fears that Harry Crerar
will not be too good; however, I am keeping him out of the party as long

impression of Montgomery as a military professional was highly favorable: "small,
very alert, wonderfully conceited, and the best soldier- or so it seems — I have met
in the war" (D'Este, Bitter Victory, PP. 68). On the eve of the Normandy invasion,
Patton wrote in his diary "T hove a better impression of Montgomery than I had"
(Hamilton, Monty, II, 590). It has been argued that Montgomery and Patton,
outstanding Allied field commanders on the European side of World War II " were
in many ways alike (Martin Blumerson and James L. Stokesbury, Masters of the Art
