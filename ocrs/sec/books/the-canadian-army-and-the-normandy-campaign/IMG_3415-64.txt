Long Forgotten Winters
been established, it follows naturally that the Canadian Army could scarcely
have become operational without British assistance and the existence of its
small caste of prewar staff-trained officers. Again, the greatest value of a
general staff, that it permits an army and its officers to train for war in
periods of peace, seems to be confirmed.
That this should be is simply
because there is rarely enough time in war to train a really good field staff.

African War in 1903. The reforms of the Esher Committee were to an extent the
fruits of the 1890 Hartington Committee, which proposed replacing the Com-
mander-in-Chief with a Chief of the General Staff and setting up a War Office
Council. Bond argues that had there been a British version of von Moltke, the
General Staff could have become an even more effective army elite and "brain"
capable of forming a "school of thought" than it did. In his estimation, the nearest
approximation turned out to be Maurice Hankey, the secretary of the CID. On the
CID, see Nicholas D'Ombrain, War Machinery and High Policy: Defence Administration
