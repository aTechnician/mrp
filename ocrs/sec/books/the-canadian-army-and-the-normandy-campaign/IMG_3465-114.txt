of Command (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1975), pp. 230-239]. According to Ladislas
Farago, Patton readily conceded that Montgomery was
"a good and ingenious
commander, somewhat like himself"' and "the only general in the Allied camp with
whom he would have to compete and who was worth competing with" [Ladislas
Farago, Patton: Ordeal and Triumph (New York: Dell, 1975), p. 492]. Patton was
the only American officer to attend Montgomery's Tripoli Study Week 15-17 Feb-
ruary 1943. At that time Montgomery described him as "an old man of about 60,"
which was roughly correct (Hamilton, Monty, II, 143).

12. Salmon was a regular officer of the Royal Canadian Regiment who had been
wounded twice and awarded the Military Cross in the Great War. A stickler for
detail and a hard taskmaster, he was generally recognized as a good trainer. For
other impressions of Salmon, see Tony Foster, Meeting of Generals (Toronto: Me-
thuen, 1986), p. 253; Lt. Gen.
McClelland and Stewart, 1987), pp. 112-114, 126, 134, 137; and Maj. -Gen. George

The first is anti, the second pro, and the last probably the most balanced.

(Three Rivers Regiment) and J. C. Jefferson of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment
skipped a rank in accordance with Commonwealth practice to command as brig-
adiers, respectively, the 4th Armoured and 10th Infantry Brigades.
Simonds also
brought with him his Ist Division artillery commander, Brig.
A. B. Matthews,
who took over as CRA; his engineer commander, Lt.-Col. Geoffrey Walsh, on
promotion to brigadier assumed the post of Chief Engineer. Brig. H. V. D. Laing
remained DA & QMG of 2 Corps and Brig. S. F. Clarke the Chief Signals Officer.
Brig. R. A. Wyman left the Ist Armoured in Italy to command the 2nd Armoured
Brigade in the Normandy invasion.

18. CP, Vol. 7, Crerar to Simonds 10 December 1943. Simonds's caravan had
apparently broken down the day previously, and he had requested his batman/driver
to get it set up before he returned. When he arrived he found this had not been
done due to the presence of an officer and other rank who claimed they were working
for Crerar. On learning that they needed another four hours to complete their task,
Simonds exploded with "the caravan had been built from a sketch.... [he| had made
in ten minutes" (Simonds to Crerar 15 December 1943). In the same letter, Simonds
charged that Crerar had "strongly opposed... (his) appointment as B.G.S., that
(Crerar) disapproved of... Ihis being there and that [hel.. expected] to be
removed very shortly after (Crerar] took over." This was denied by Crear.
