At the 1937 Imperial Conference, where a common system of military
organization and training was agreed, he had eagerly embraced the ap-
peasement stance of Chamberlain. After Munich, he basked in the same
limelight as illuminated the British Prime Minister for avoiding war over
"a far away country," and surrendering without a shot 40 Czech divisions.
When Chamberlain finally abandoned appeasement on the German occu-
pation of what remained of the Czechoslovak Republic in March 1939,
Mackenzie King did not.58

British Power (New York: William Morrow, 1972), pp. 71-73, 249. By the end of
the war, the British Empire had fielded 80 infantry and eight cavalry divisions on
active service outside the United Kingdom and India, of which 61 infantry and three
cavalry were on the Western Front. The Royal Air Force possessed 22,000 aircraft.
The Royal Navy had more battleships (61) than the American and French fleets
combined and twice as many as the Japanese and Italian navies together. It had
nearly twice as many cruisers (120) and destroyers (466) as the American and French
total and nearly three times as many destroyers as the Japanese and Italians combined.

Americans were the most "determined opponents" of Canadian international rep-
resentation at the armistice, viewing it as but another "limb of the spreading British
imperial tree." When at Versailles U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing inquired
as to "why Canada should be concerned in the settlement of European affairs,
Prime Minister Lloyd George replied "because some hundreds and thousands from
the Dominions had died for the vindication of the public right in Europe and that
Canada as well as Australia had lost more men than the United States in... [thel
war" (Stacey, Age of Conflict, I, 246, 273). It is worth comparing Borden's position

were fatal. In the Second World War fatal casualties amounted to 41,992 [Col.

7. The conscription issue was really more symptom than cause. In Australia
voluntary enlistment alone sufficed to split "the male population of the country into
those who joined up and those who did not," producing a socio-political cleavage
that "tore out Australia's heart, shattered the community and caused untold mental
agony" [L. L. Robson, The First AIF: A Study of its Recruitment 1914-1918 (Mel-
bourne: University of Melbourne Press, 1970), pp. 2-3].

in Canada (Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 23-24. According to one
estimate, Canada had by 1917 enlisted only 9.6 percent of its male population. Of
800,000 British-born Canadians, however, 37.5 percent had already enlisted, the
highest proportion for any group within the British Empire. Only 1.4 percent of
French-Canadians enlisted and but 2.4 percent of Quebec's population, compared
to 9.5 percent for British Columbia (Ibid., p. 62; and Stacey, Age of Conflict, 1, 235-
