Long Forgotten Winters
Large-scale exercises were to remain a feature of Canadian training over-
seas from 1941 onwards.
Exercise
"Waterloo,
directed by Headquarters
South Eastern Command during the period 14-16 June, was the first major
scheme in which
the entire Canadian Corps participated under Mc-
Naughton's command. Like "Fox,
" it practiced the formation in a mobile
counterattack role within an anti-invasion scenario. Again, certain short-
comings were revealed, among which the observation by General Paget
that too many conferences were held in lieu of issuing brief directives and
verbal orders.
65 Between 29 September and 3 October, the Canadian Corps
took part in Exercise "Bumper,
" the largest and perhaps most portentous
maneuvers ever to be held in the United Kingdom. Involving two armies
of four corps of 12 divisions, three of them armored, plus two army tank
brigades and ancillary troops,
"Bumper"
practiced the field army in Britain
in the anti-invasion role. Significantly,
the Chief Umpire for "Bumper"
was Lieutenant-General Montgomery who on 17 November 1941 assumed
the appointment of G.O.C.-in-C. South Eastern Command. On the same
day, Canadian Corps headquarters took over the 4 British Corps defensive
sector on the Sussex coast, which placed it directly under his operational
Though the Canadian role was now more positional than mobile, the
invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 lune preatly lessened the likelihood of
a German attack on Great Britain. As a result, the emphasis in training
throughout the field army assumed a more offensive orientation. The two-
sided exercises "Beaver Ill" and "Beaver IV," conducted under Canadian
Corps direction from 22-24 April and 10-13 May 1942, respectively, saw
participating divisions attacking and defending in turn.
The last and most
famous exercise conducted by Montgomery before he left to take command
of the Eighth Army in North Africa had nothing to do with invasion.
Exercise "Tiger,"
as it was labeled, pitted the 12 British Corps and the 1
Canadian Corps against each other in an 11_dav encounter battle that tested
fighting organization, doctrine, and troop capabilities to the limit. " It also
provided, as will be shown, a reasonably accurate measure of the state of
Canadian Army training at that juncture.
