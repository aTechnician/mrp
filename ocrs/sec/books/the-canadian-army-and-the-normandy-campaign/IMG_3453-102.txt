Half-Forgotten Summer
On the fragmentation of British tactics, see Bidwell, Gunners, pp. 164-177. The
brilliant discussion carried on by Barnett, Bidwell, and Carver through letters to
the editor in the JRUSI, 3 (September 1981), 1 (March 1982), and 3 (September
1982) over British doctrine is also most instructive.

was ten miles behind his leading elements when he recommended withdrawal.
Montgomery, ever hard-nosed, sorted him out (Strawson, El Alamein, 111-113).
Lacking sufficient infantry to attack gun lines in front of Rahman track, the army
commander also reluctantly decided to employ armor in precisely the way it should
not have been used (Lucas, War in the Desert, PP. 203-204, 235, 239-244). Given
the choice, Montgomery was not prepared to sacrifice rifle companies for tanks.

ideal. Squadrons were never to be split between echelons.

infantry battalion, while the independent armored brigade intended to support an
infantry division did not. The Churchill "p" tank had given a good account of itself
in Tunisia.

of firing armor-piercing or high-explosive shells. There were two close support
tanks per squadron armed with howitzers that could fire high explosive or smoke.
The remaining tanks mounted six-pounders.

position was built around the antitank defense, which had to be in depth and properly
coordinated. The primary role of the antitank gun was the destruction of tanks and
not the protection of friendly infantry, whose mission was to protect the gun from
enemy infantry attack (see Tuker, Approach to Battle, pp. 283-284 and Bidwell and
Graham, Fire-Power, PP. 245-246). The 17-pounder had a performance slightly su-
perior to the dreaded 88 mm, being able to defeat almost four and one-half inches
of armor at 1,000 yards as opposed to the latter's four.

Gieat War to provide a protective curtain of shrapnel for attacking infantrymen,
particularly over the critical "last 300 vards" before they disappeared into the melee.
Tuker was very much opposed to barrages, wrongly according to Bidwell, who
nonetheless described him as a "gifted and unusual officer who took the trouble to
concern himself in artillery matters, as opposed to merely demanding results" (Bid-
well, Gunners, p. 192).
