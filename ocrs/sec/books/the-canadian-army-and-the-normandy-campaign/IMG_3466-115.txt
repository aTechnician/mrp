battle for Agira in Sicily [Christopher H. N. Hull, "A Case Study of Professionalism
in the Canadian Army in the 1930's and 1940's: Lieutenant-General G. G. Simonds"
(unpublished M.A. thesis, Purdue University, 1989), pp. 50-57]. Here a timed
program of artillery concentrations on suspected enemy locations, as opposed to a
creeping barrage, supported a battalion attack. The enemy were not where they
were expected, the infantry fell behind, and the attack failed. Two more separate
attacks by 1st Brigade battalions were also unsuccessful. Agira was finally taken by
the 2nd Brigade in two battalion actions [Graham,

Van Nostrand, flown out to examine Simonds, who had just come out of the hospital
to take over command of the 5th Division near Caserta. Van Nostrand was sup-
posedly intercepted before reaching Simonds's headquarters, which was probably
most fortunate. [Tony Foster, Meeting of Generals (Toronto: Methuen,

1943, McNaughton proposed to have Crerar take over "the Ist Division for a few
months," but Simonds's incumbency rendered this impossible. A month later, on
learning that Simonds had fallen ill, McNaughton signaled Montgomery that Crerar
would be content to serve in a lesser rank if accepted as a division commander. The
political nature of the dispatch of 1 Canadian Corps to the Mediterranean, however,
found Crerar charged with the responsibility to bring all Canadian units and for-
mations in Italy under his command. The Eighth Army, having never been asked,
had at the same time little requirement for an armored division and still less for a
corps headquarters foisted on it by Ottawa politicians. On the matter of Crear's
refusal to step down as GOC 1 Corps to command Ist Division, see also Col. Dick

but he found it "most irritating when it
verged on the stupid" (VP, "The Adriatic Front"). Canadians appear to have worn
top hats on more than one occasion. Simonds was less impressed than Montgomery
(Graham, Citizen Soldier, p. 173).

kindly and in fact treated many lower ranking subordinates very poorly. According
to Stacey, who witnessed him publicly tear a strip off his personal pilot much to
the embarrassment of many within earshot, there "was some element of terror in
his manner of command" (C. P. Stacey, "Canadian Leaders of the Second World
War," CHR, 1 (March 1985): 68; and Foster, Meeting of Generals, p. 394). Mont-
gomery recommended that Dempsey be given command of the First Canadian Army
and Lt-Gen. Sir Oliver Leese the Second British. His rationale was that "the Ca-
nadians would gladly accept a British general whom they know and trust rather
than have the troops mishandled by an inexperienced general of their own. Dempsey
has served with them and they all know and like him. As soon as they can produce
their own general, then he takes over at once; until that time, give the Canadian
army to Dempsey" (Hamilton, Monty, I, 465).

their respective divisions, the 3rd and Ist, on 8 September 1942, several months
ahead of Simonds who, after brief service as a brigade commander under the latter,
became GOC 2nd Division on 13 April 1943.

write in this vein," reported Crocker,
"because I have appreciated very much the
great privilege it has been to have a Canadian Div. under my command." Crocker
has been described as "stern and humourless," but one whose "long experience
with armoured forces made him an excellent choice as the corps commander whose
units would spearhead the invasion of... Normandy" (D'Este,
Decision in Nor-
mandy, pp. 60-61). Crocker had won a DSO and MC as a Second Lieutenant in the
Machine Gun Corps. He attended Staff College while still a subaltern, and was
Hobar's BM in the 1930s. His command experience ran from the 3rd Armoured
Brigade in France to the 6th Armoured Division, 9 and 11 Corps in North Africa.
According to Field Morshal Lord Carver, "to serve him was an education in itself."
The Editor, British Army Review, described him as follows: "A man of legendary
personal courage and absolute integrity, he had the unusual gift of being as fine a
staff officer as he was a commander in battle" " Thoughts on Command in Battle,"
British Army Review, 1 July 1978): 5].

in December 1943.
