Half-Forgotten Summer
at St. Lambert and Polish positions at Coudehard, but the 2nd SS Panzer
Corps "breaking back" on Polish defenses to the east. Between St. Lambert
and Chambois up "Dead Horse Alley," the Germans ultimately managed
to extricate possibly one-third of their forces. By nightfall 21 August the
Gap was nonetheless closed for good and its endless controversy begun.
For our purposes, however, but one thing needs to be noted: in this confused
fighting, for which reinforcements were never requested by corps or army,
individual Canadian soldiers and units, even when outnumbered, appear
with few exceptions to have performed well.35
The Battle of Normandy, rightfully considered one of the world's most
decisive, was over. It had cost the Canadian Army 18,444 casualties,
cluding 5,021 dead. The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division also suffered greater
losses than any other division within the 21st Army Group. The 2nd Ca-
nadian Infantry Division, though it did not arrive in France until 7 July,
incurred the next highest. All told, battle casualties slightly exceeded 3,000
incurre, 5.500 in July, and 7,400 for the period 1-23 August. Fighting in
"Totalize" through "Tractable" up to 21 August accounted for 5,679 cas-
ualties. Significantly, the two British divisions with the highest casualty
rates, the 3rd and 51st (Highland), both landed on D-Day. 36
The trouble-
some thing about these figures is that they cannot simply be explained away
in nationalist terms of Canadians being assigned more difficult tactical tasks.
As already mentioned, British engagements in the bocage to the west ap
proached Great War proportions in their severity. Fighting in the "Epsom"
offensive, for example, " reached a sustained intensity rare even in the Nor-
mandy campaign.
137 One might have expected further, from the experience
of the Great War, that an all-volunteer army would have performed ap-
preciably better than a conscripted one like the British.
To say that the Canadian government got more than it deserved from
the performance of its castaway army in Normandy would nonetheless be
an understatement. One cannot escape the feeling that the prime minister
of Canada would personally have preferred its troops to have fought and
died with as little fuss and bother as possible. That many Canadian soldiers
came to look upon Britain as a surrogate homeland is not therefore sur-
prising. After the closure of the Falaise Gap, of course, the First Canadian
Army literally marched into a new world order. Whereas the battle for
Normandy was directed by a British field commander, the rest of "Ov-
erlord"
was not. From 1 September onward, Montgomery reverted to
command an army group of roughly 15 divisions. His erstwhile subordi-
nate, Bradley, on the other hand, rose to command close to 50 in what
clearly signaled a changing of the guard. The First Canadian Army, whose
British composition at one point increased to 80 percent, advanced with
the rest of the British Liberation Army into an imperial retreat.
