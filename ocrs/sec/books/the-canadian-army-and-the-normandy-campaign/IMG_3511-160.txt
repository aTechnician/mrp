Case Hardening
We who have spent so many years in England think and speak constantly
of England and our friends there... even to the point of appearing
disloyal to Canada.
The thought of returning there on leave sometime
soon alone makes life supportable at times.
Canadian War Diary Entry, 31 August 1944'
The black day, Der Schwarze Tag, visited upon the German army on 8
August 1918 by the Canadian and Australian corps was not repeated in the
half-forgotten summer of 1944. In the final analysis Operation "Totalize"
was a failure. Despite overwhelming air and artillery superiority, five di-
visions and two armored brigades comprising upwards of 600 tanks could
not handle two depleted German divisions, mustering no more than 60
panzers and tank destroyers. Contrary to popular belief, the bulk of roughly
80 88-mm antitank guns,
mostly belonging to three Luftwaffe flak regi-
ments, were deployed south of Potigny; only the divisional batteries were
forward. It was thus mainly the 12th SS Division's resourceful handling of
Tigers and Panthers that stemmed the Canadian attack.
Yet, while these
Eastern Front leviathans were more than a match for Shermans and Church-
ills, the Germans had nothing to compare with the Typhoon or "Jabo"
Jagdbombern) as their troops fearfully labeled it. Then, too, the 17-pounder
in its Firefly, SP, and towed configurations possessed an ample margin of
power over the Tiger as demonstrated since 1943?
To Simonds, the problem was not weapons or machines, but rather a
lack of proper handling of resources within armored divisions. Troops also
displayed a tendency, traceable back to training in Britain, to stick to roads
and thereby inevitably encounter the antitank guns sited to cover them.
