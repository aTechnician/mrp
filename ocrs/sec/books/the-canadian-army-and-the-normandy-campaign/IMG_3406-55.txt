of home leave (Ibid. p. 430). British home leave was not granted until September
1944. Until then a regular might have served un to nine vears abroad and a conscript
four (Fraser, And We Shall Shock Them, p. 105)

"I did not notice anyone in the Cabinet [on 3 November 1944] who had said that
he had knowledge of men receiving extra money. They had understood employer.
were to pay for labour at the price that other labour would receive, but that whatever
was in excess of the pay which the NDMA men were receiving would go to the
state... Mitchell (Minister of Labour) said there had not been such an agreement.
Isley Minister of Financel and others thought there had been." McNaughton, by
this point Minister of National Defence, put a stop to this practice, stating,
were to be an army they should be an army of soldiere doing work as soldiers and
not as wage earners" (Ibid.).

tralian Imperial Force was predominantly from the cities. As Gimblett has already
shown, more than 60 percent of the Canadian general officer corps in the post-
Great War era had urban roots; this was in contrast to the U.S. Army officer corps,
which Morris Janowitz found to be 77 percent rural in 1920. The largely aristocratic
British officer corps was probably also more rural [Richard H. Gimblett,

that "modelling the [Canadian) army on British lines" was akin to adopting British
judicial institutions (CP, Vol. 10, Pearson to Crerar 14 January 1938).
42. Stacey, Six Years, pp. 32, 43-45. The reinforcement of French-Canadian units
was perceived as a particularly knotty problem in 1944, when it was thought it
might be necessary to "cannibalize" one of four French-Canadian battalions in order
to maintain the remaining three at requisite strength.
Another option entertained
was to simply reinforce them with English-speaking companies. CP, Vol. 8, Mem-

"to get a French-
