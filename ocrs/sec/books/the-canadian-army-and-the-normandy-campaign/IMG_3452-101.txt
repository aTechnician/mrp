The U.S. Army never
trusted its forward observers to such a degree; they recommended, but never com-
manded, fire. As Bidwell and Graham point out, in the Great War artillery became
highly scientific, mastering the arts of counterbattery and the "break-in" battle. The
"Uncle" target system superseded neither accurate survey (which was essential in
preparing large, map-predicted fire plans) nor the normal engagement of targets of
opportunity or the registration of local fire plans by battery observers. It was simply
a means of rapidly landing a hammer blow to repel a counterattack of smash
unexpected resistance (Bidwell and Graham, Fire-Power, pp. 195-201).

serving under the same commanders (CAGRA) and affiliating AGRA with for-
mations was stressed. AGRA were almost called Royal Artillery Groups, but the
acronym "RAG"
was not preferred.

November 1943. The CCRA was responsible for coordinating bombardment 3$
well as counterbattery. He had no staff for fire planning, details of which were
worked out by CRAs and AGRA commanders (CAGRA). The BRA was respon-
sible for directing the coordination of artillery throughout the army and for advising
the army commander in all artillery matters.

of disbandine the cavalry. accordina to Ridwell and Graham, had led to that "most
mentally iner unar fessions and reactionary group in the Britch army" raining
proprietary richt to the tonk. Socil rather than tactical or military considerations
also originally accounted for the wholesale conversion of the exclusive 60th Rifle
and Rifle Brioade to the tank support role as "motorized" infantry. In their words
the cavalry simoly "did not mix with lesser beings" (Bidwell and Graham, Fin
Power. p. 227). Thanch Hore-Relisha meroed the Rous Tank Corns and the cavalry
into one Royal Armoured Corps in 1939, Sir John Dill noted as CIGS in 1940 that

it was the practice of some cavalry regiments "to choose officers according to their
income" (Macksey, The Royal Armoured Corps, pp. 11, 66, 119).

velocity 37-mm turret gun and a 75-mm close support weapon in its hull sponson.
Up to 1942 no German tank save the Mark IIIJ (Special) with the L60 long 50-mm
gun, of which there were but 19 in the summer of 1942, could penetrate any British
tank frontally. Four Mark IVF2 (Special) panzers with the more powerful long,
high-velocity 75 mm also arrived in May 1942.

thus reduced by half. The "column" was adopted as a useful expedient during a
period when the British were numerically weak. They were, in fact. little more
than mobile escorted to do tafonte common cat tank troop: their
original purpose was to lend artillery weight to forward screens and to harass the
enemy. The invention of Brig. "Tock" Camobell, VC. a gunner, they were elevated
possibly because of his reputation as a fighter from minor to maior tactical status
