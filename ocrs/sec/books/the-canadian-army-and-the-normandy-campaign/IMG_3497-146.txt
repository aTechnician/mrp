p. 206; and Hutchinson,
"Corps Commander," pp. 175-176, 178, 182. Plans had
been made for 2nd Division to smoke off its right flank, with 3rd Division artillery
on call if required.

mery, 14 July 1944; Col. G. W. L. Nicholson, Official History of the Canadian Army
in the Second World War, Vol. II: The Canadians in Italy: 1943-1945 (Ottawa: Queen's
Printer, 1956), pp. 451, 606; and Lt.-Gen. E.L.M. Burns, General Mud: Memoirs of
Two World Wars (Toronto: Clarke, Irwin, 1970), pp. 218-221. In considering future
commanders on 16 May 1944, Crerar wrote:
"Simonds and I are agreed that, as
regards mentality, Foulkes possesses the necessary qualifications. On the other hand,
he has not been tried out in the field and though he certainly possesses the brains
and the outlook, he may not show himself equipped with the necessary mental and
moral stamina." Crerar also compared Simonds and Burns: "In my opinion both
Simonds and Burns are capable of successfully filling the appointment of Army
Comd. Of the two, Simonds would probably be the more brilliant and show more
drive in field operation]s. Burns is the better balanced and looks further ahead"
(CP, Vol. 8, Crerar to Stuart, 16 May 1944). Burns's Canadian divisional com-
manders would not probably have agreed that his "shy, introverted, and hum-
mourless" manner marked him as a good field commander. According to Maj.-
Gen. Chris Vokes, "No nicknames were ever more negative in their meaning than
those given to General Burns, as he was known throughout 1 Canadian Corps as
"Laughing Boy' or "Smiling Sunray" [Vokes Papers (VP), Adriatic Front— Winter
1944].
Stacey, Date with History, PP. 174-178. Too much has always been made of
whether or not "Spring" was a holding attack. As Tuker so simply put it: "A
holding attack which actually engages, instead of a feint which does not engage,
can seldom be effective if its attack fails, because the enemy is no longer under threat
in that sector. He has won and can turn elsewhere" [Lt.-Gen. Sir Francis Tuker
Approach to Battle (London: Cassell, 1963), p. 255].

Here Canadian troops were badly shelled by their own artillery, but it was not so
much the fault of the artillery as high-level planners. Again, inadequate reconnais-
sance seems to have been the problem.
The magnitude of the Lamone obstacle, 25-
foot high food banks on the land side and a 40-foot drop to the river, was grossly
underestimated. In 12 hours, 164 casualties were incurred. There is also evidence
that Foulkes mishandled his division in the Foret de la Londe outside Rouen, 27-
29 August 1944 [Paul Douglas Dickson, "Command Relations in the Northwest
Europe Campaign, 1944-45: Montgomery and the Canadians" (unpublished M. A.
thesis, Acadia University, 1985), p. 62].

had already been given command of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards on
18 December 1944 [Lt.-Col. H. M. Jackson, The Princess Louise Dragoon Guards
(Published by the Regiment, 1951), p. 244].
34. CP, Vol. 3, Simonds to Dempsey, 27 July 1944. "Simonds handled both
Keller and Cunningham very sensibly," Crerar wrote approvingly,
"and both are
carrying on in their respective appointments for the time being and until Simonds
has reached more or less independent conclusions as to their abilities." He also noted
that "in light of other information,
" he was "not sure at all of Keller being able to
last the course." Keller had been considered a replacement for Burns as commander
of 1 Corps (CP, Vol. 3, Crerar to Stuart, 15 July 1944; and Notes on Meeting with
CIGS at Tac HQ C-in-C 21 Army Gp 1630-1730 hrs, 19 July 1944). There were
also reports of looting and vandalism on the 3rd Division front at Colomby-sur-
Thaon, Putot-en-Bessin, Les Buissons, and Villons les Buissons. Similar incidents
were reported on the U.S. front (CP, Vol. 4, Maj. J. P. Manion, SO 2 Infm to
SCAO, 26 June 1944; CP, Vol. 4, Crerar to Keller, 29 June 1944; and CP, Vol. 4,

Operation "Bluecoat,"
which involved six divisions and two armored brigades,
spelled the end of Operations "Rawlinson" and "Byng." It was at this time that
Montgomery announced that the Belgian and Dutch contingents of about brigade
size would be going to the First Canadian Army (actually 1 British Corps).

Paran, Calgary Highlanders, pp, 154-156; and Stacey, Victory Campaign, p. 205. The
CO of the Calgary Highlanders ordered artillery fire stopped to show the effects
of the German counterbarrage. A message log entry for 0325 hours, 1 August, also
recorded "Essex mortars shelling us. Stop fire" (RG 24, Vol. 14, 109, WD HQ 5
