Calkin of the North Shore Regiment, should at the time have been ahead of his

Notes on Commanders, 25 April 1942; Notes on Beaver IV; and Notes on Inf Bdes
of Canadian Corps, No. 6, 2 March 1942, 3 Inf Bde. Montgomery thought Potts
and Ganong both made very poor showings on "Beaver III"; they were, in his
opinion, too old and rigidly set in their ways. As for Pearkes, he wrote: "His mind
works in a groove and he gets the bit between his teeth, puts on blinkers, and drives
ahcad blindly." Montgomery criticized the 1st Division for attacking its objective
oblivious to a threat developing on its right flank. He felt that Pearkes should have
protected his attack against this blow, which, when it did come, would have in
Montgomery's estimation destroyed the Ist Division under real war conditions.
The division also did not do well in the withdrawal. Still, Montgomery believed
the Ist Division had "very fine material and should be a first class division."

36. CP, Vol. 1, Crerar to McNaughton, 4 March 1941. Crerar later wrote to
McNaughton: "I have come to the definite conclusion that as a Divisional Com-
mander... [Price) is handicapped in two important respects. He does not possess
what might be termed a "sense of tactics." He is unable quickly to appreciate a
military situation and to dominate it with the requisite speed and decision" (CP,
Vol. 1, Crerar to McNaughton, 10 Aug 1942).

Division well-handled on "Beaver IIl"; he also considered Roberts "teachable." H
did remark, however upon the very positive influence on the division of the GSC
1, Lieutenant-Colonel COC. Maem Poom 28 January 1944 COS First Canadian
Army) and suggested that Roberts not be left without a "really good officer" in
that staff position. He thus implied that an average division commander "would
alvays do well if he haldl a good G.S.O. 1" (CP, Vol. 2, Beaver Ill Notes on
Commanders).
