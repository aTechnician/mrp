vantages" of what can only be described as a ground swell induced by Scott.
On 17 August 1942 he directed that the emphasis placed on physical fitness
and battle drill was to "be increased rather than diminished, for the adoption
of the drill speed[ed] up deployment and enabl[ed] a unit or subunit to
develop its maximum battle power quickly."42
By April 1943 training within 1 Canadian Corps invariably stressed the
development of instinctive, immediate, and reasonably correct responses to
battle situations through battle drills that provided a "habitual framework
of action to typical situations" and a "realism in training... [that] simu-
lated] the varying conditions of battle."43 Crerar stipulated like Montgo-
mery, however, that battle drill could "never be more than a guide to action
...a means, not an end... [that had] to be varied to a greater, or lesser,
extent, in every battle action." Unlike Montgomery, he seems to have
accepted them as "basic 'drills' of fire and movement, covering unit and
sub-unit" that assisted in the execution "of the various operations of war.
In this respect, of course, some have argued that Maxse's system of teaching
minor tactics set forth in Platoon
Training (1919) was incomparably
superior.
Though still others attest to the value of battle drill, 4 one cannot escape
the impression that it possessed distinctly faddist overtones. The perception
that it somehow represented a new, inspired style of training innately su-
perior to the older methods of the "rutted military mind"
doubtless in-
creased its appeal among a confident, even cocky, North American
soldiery * What seems to have been missed in adopting the battle drill
expedient, however, is that training emphasis reverted from the formation
level to individual training. 18 That the Canadian high command did not
intervene to ensure a proper balance is obvious, and inexcusable. On the
other hand, battle drill failed noticeably to supplant "smartening up" close
order drill that continued to be conducted, with great regularity and ques-
tionable benefit, for companies and platoons on the parade square. * Iron-
ically, and in keeping with the nature of a fad, the revised instructions
promulgated for infantry corps training in August 1944 made no mention
of battle drill. 50
While Montgomery in February 1942 remarked on the "backwardness"
of the 3rd Division, which he considered "behind the other Divisions in
training and readiness for war," he did not blame the troops. That they
had been issued no ammunition and were "thus living in a peace atmos-
phere,'
could only be ascribed to a lack of professionalism at the top.
Montgomery's first-hand observations of Canadian battalions during Ex-
ercise "Tiger" between 19-30 May 1942 confirmed this impression. Though
he found some of the men who had marched from 100 to over 150 miles
"tired and unshaven," he encountered more who were "cheerful and march-
ing well." The problem, as he saw it, was how to "put them into battle
properly and with a good chance of success. *52 After "Beaver III" in April,

he advocated further training in "offensive fighting in small self-contained
groups of all arms" (rifle company-size with mortar detachment, carrier
section, and "arm[oure]d O.P. [Observation Posts] from the artillery"); the
object being to learn "to break the battle down, and to carry on the fight
by the infiltration of hard hitting groups. "53 It is of course clear that Mont-
gomery harbored more reservations about Canadian officers than their "fit
and tough" troops. "The soldiery in the Canadian Corps," he recorded,
"are probably the best material in any armies of the Empire."54
