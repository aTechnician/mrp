other obstacles protected by antitank guns, however, led many to conclude
that tanks "no less than others, should not be sent into the
Unknown."
Where information was "not positive or lacking," it was decreed, "a First
Ech[elon] was not justified. "23
Indeed, for assaults against prepared positions, the armored corps itself
urged the initial use of a second echelon, with tanks supporting infantry
from behind while artillery "neutralized" the objective. The rearward po-
sition for armor was recommended as tanks were "blind at any time" and,
if leading, could not "see what the infantry... [were] doing"; tank fire
from flanks and hull-down positions (all but gun and turret defiladed) was
also thought to be "more effective than actual physical support."24 Further
direction on "the construction of echelons" appeared in a 21st Army Group
pamphlet based on Army Training Instruction No. 2 of May 1943. Ac-
cording to "The Cooperation of Tanks with Infantry Divisions in Offensive
Operations,"
the terms first, second, third,
and fourth with respect to
echelons were to be discontinued. The tank-infantry attack was henceforth
to be conducted in three echelons only-assault, support, and reserve cach
of two or more waves.
The purpose of the assault echelon was to advance behind artillery support
"to assault,
disrupt and dominate the immediate objective,
" seeking in
particular the destruction of any surviving enemy antitank weapons. Again,
experience from fighting in Tunisia confirmed that, even with maximum
artillery support, assault echelons composed solely of armor moving at tank
speed seldom proved successful. More often than not, enemy machine-gun
posts came to life after artillery fire supporting the assault echelon had lifted;
these served to delay the advance of follow-on infantry, which left the tanks
tied to their objectives and terribly vulnerable to counterattack. For these
reasons, assault echelons in deliberate attacks against prepared positions
came to be composed primarily of infantry alone or tanks and infantry in
ratios appropriate to circumstances. The support echelon, also characterized
by tanks "shepherding" infantry as an essential ingredient, stood by pre-
pared to complete the subjugation of the objective area and repel counter-
attacks. The reserve echelon, which usually contained infantry and tanks
in separate groupings, remained to be used as required by the commander
of the overall attack. 26
The introduction of the Sherman medium tank, with its 75-mm gun
capable of firing high-explosive, smoke, or armor-piercing rounds, even-
tually blurred the distinction between the cruiser and "P" tank, of which
the Churchill was the last. In a conference on 13 January 1944, in fact,
Montgomery decreed that henceforth only two types of tanks would be
recognized: the light reconnaissance tank and the "capital" tank, the latter
category comprising both the Sherman and the heavier Churchill mounting
cither a six-pounder or 75-mm gun. There was to be no difference between
Churchill-equipped army tank and Sherman-equipped armored brigades;
