45. CP, Vol. 8, Memorandum of a Meeting with C-in-C 21 Army Group at Tac
HQ 21 Army Group commencing 1500 hrs, 25 July 1944. Eventually two operations,
much like Crocker suggested, were planned: Operation "Rawlinson" to be con-
ducted by the 3rd British Division south of the Bois de Bavent; and Operation
"Byng" to be carried out by the 49th Division north of the wood. The detachment
of the 3rd Division for Operation "Bluecoat" on 1 August precluded these operations
from ever being executed (Stacey, Victory Campaign, PP. 198-201). In 21 Army
Group M515 of 27-7-44, Montgomery stated he "realized" that limited resources
"may prevent the full implementation" of M512 direction concerning the advance-
ment of the First Canadian Army left flank. Given that the German 12-cm mortar
could hurl a 35-pound bomb 6,500 yards and the feared 15-cm six-barrelled Ne-
belwerfer several 75-pound bombs more than 7,000 yards, easily reaching past the
objective line selected by Crerar, it would appear that Crocker might well have
been the more tactically astute.
46. CP, Vol. 8, Montgomery to Crerar, 26 July 1944. That Crear absorbed this
lesson is obvious from his latery marks: The C-in-C would not give a direct order
to a particular Div. He would tell me what action he wanted carried out. Indeed,
under normal conditions, I, as Army Comd, would not instruct Gen Simonds, a
Corps Comd, which tps should be employed by him to carry out my requirements,
though I might suggest that, say, the P. A.D. [Polish Armoured Division] seemed
to be well placed to do the job." (CP, Vol. 21, Crerar to Stacey, 23 July 1947).

expressed these same sentiments to the CIGS on 7 July 1944, the latter wrote back:
"It is evident that the Canadians are very short of senior Commanders, but it is
equally clear that we shall have to make the best use of the material we have.... I
want you to make the best possible use of Crerar.... You can keep him busy small
and give him the less important roles." MAP, BLM 126, M508 Montgomery to
