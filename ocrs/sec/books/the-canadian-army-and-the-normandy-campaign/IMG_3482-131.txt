Half-Forgotten Summer
preferred to serve with the 3rd Division, had been placed under command
of Foulkes's 2nd Division. Young's 6th Brigade, already given the Black
Watch, now also received under command the 1st Hussars, which with the
Sherbrookes were placed in close support of infantry to repel counterattack.
Pressure on the front of the depleted Essex began to tell around 0900 hours,
however, when the 1st Hussars reported that troops were moving to the
rear. When this was shortly confirmed by a liaison officer, orders were
given and patrols established to prevent any further rearward movement
by the Essex Scottish.
This, of course, did not prevent increasing enemy infantry and tank
infiltration of the Essex position. The Black Watch were accordingly warned
to be prepared to counterattack at 1600 hours to restore the situation. In
order for the artillery to complete the necessary arrangements, the attack
was delayed until 1800 hours, at which time it was successfully carried out
under cover of a creeping barrage. The line thus stabilized along the road
St. André-Hubert Folie. Beauvoir and Troteval farms were at the same time
lost, as were most men of the forward FMR companies. All together
Foulkes's 2nd Division lost 1, 149 casualties in Operation "Atlantic," a much
higher figure than the 386 sustained by the 3rd; yet more than half were
suffered by regiments committed on the second day in pursuit of a perceived
opportunity. Total 2 Canadian Corps casualties were close to 90 percent or
more of those suffered by 8 Corps in its
"death ride of... armoured
divisions.
Simonds's 2 Canadian Corps was now blooded, but it had paid a high
price. The attack on 20 July was by any measure a disaster _Canadian troops
had fled in the face of the enemy, but the SSR could hardly be blamed for
having been placed in such a tactically untenable position as they were.
Unquestionably, they should have been intimately supported by tanks that
far better than infantry chests could lean into a barrage and take a hit.
Doctrine played a part here, as well as an armored corps perception that
other arms failed to understand the limitations of armor, that tanks should
not be expected to lead attacks against prepared enemy antitank positions.
Yet, as established casualty rates of 76 percent for infantry against seven
percent for armor indicate, * most crews from shot-up tanks got away to
fight another day. Here, of course, the buck must be passed back to higher
command for not insisting, as Montgomery did, on making armor conform
even against its will. However one looks at it, Canadian troops regardless
of their experience level did all, and more, that could possibly have been
expected of them in the attack on Verrières Ridge.

stgruppenfuhrer [sic] (Col.-Gen.) Joseph "Sepp" Dietrich, Commander 1st SS Pz
Corps and 6 SS Pz Army. The 16,000-man strong 21st Panzer Division of three
panzer (Mark IV 75mm) and two panzergrenadier regiments had been deployed by
Rommel specifically to defend Caen, which it did with some bumbling success.
Unfortunately for the Germans, their high command structure was unnecessarily
fragmented. Field Marshal Gerd von Rundtstedt at Oberbefehlshaber West (OB West)
had under him Rommel's Army Group B of the Seventh and Fifteenth Armies and
Army Group G south of the Loire. He had also formed in November 1943 Panzer
Group West, which under Lieutenant-General Geyr von Schweppenburg was to
cooperate with both. Rommel, who wished to fight the battle forward near the
beaches, was only given two additional panzer divisions, the 2nd and 116th, but
these remained in the Fifteenth Army sector. In March 1944 the 2nd SS Panzer
Corps of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions left to stem the Russian winter
offensive. Three remaining panzer divisions, the Ist SS, 12th SS, and Panzer Lehr,
could be moved only with Hitler's express approval. The problem was that Hitler
had been talked into believing, like Rommel and others fooled by "Fortitude," that
the main Allied invasion would occur in the Pas de Calais area, the Fifteenth Army
sector. See also Eversley Belfield and H. Essame, The Battle for Normandy, (London:
