Book One
Long Forgotten Winters
When Winter scourged the meadow and the hill
And in the withered leafage worked his will,
The water shrank, and shuddered, and stood still, -
Then built himself a magic house of glass,
Irised with memories of flowers and grass
Wherein to sit and watch the fury pass.
Sir Charles G. D. Roberts, Ice
