12. Swinson found that: "Regimental histories and Divisional histories are often
so inaccurate and disagree completely as to dates, times and disposition of units;
war diaries are notoriously inaccurate also" (Swinson, Kohima, pp. xiv-xv).

armed and equipped by the Americans, participated in the later stages of the cam-
paign in northwest Europe. Australia raised by the spring of 1943 a relatively
enormous army of 12 divisions, most on home defense duty in Australia and three
on garrison duty in Papua-New Guinea (Ibid). The Canadian Army in northwest
Europe advanced a total of some 450 miles (Stacey, Victory Campaign, p. 641).

parently responsible for the decision not to allow Dominion representation, even
as observers, in Anglo-American military conversations.
The matter of Canadian
membership on the Combined Chiefs of Staff would doubtless have entailed giving
similar representation to Australia, France, and perhaps even Brazil, which provided
one division to the Italian theatre in autumn 1944 (Ibid., Pp. 159-163, 200-201).
According to J. L. Granatstein, the "Canadian generals were probably not high-
powered enough to merit a seat on a supreme strategy board, even if Canada's
military contribution might have justified such representation" (J. L. Granatstein,
The Ottawa Men: The Civil Service Mandarins, 1935-1957 (Toronto: Oxford Uni-
versity Press, 1982), p. 129].
25. On the diplomatic front, Canada developed the "theory of functional rep-
resentation," whereby size of contribution to the war effort in certain specific areas

rather than overall power status determined the corresponding degree of represen-
tation. Canada was the sole country outside of Britain and the United States to gain
direct representation on the Combined Food Board and the Combined Production
and Resources Board. She was not granted membership on the Munitions Assign-
ment Board. (Stacey, Arms, Men and Governments, pp. 171-172, 179-180; and Gran-
atstein, Ottawa Men, PP. 93, 125-126, 131-132).

Canadian insistence instead on increasing the
commitment to a small two-division corps, which included an armored division
that the Allied theatre commander did not want, took on sillier proportions when
the Canadian government asked for its return before it had even fought a corps
battle. Ibid.
