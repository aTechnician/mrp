vehicles to the mile. Given safety allowance road movement calculations, this meant
it needed at the former density two routes to cut the columnar length to 50 miles
and three routes to cut it to 34 miles. At the latter density, two routes shortened
the length to 35 miles and three to 26 miles; heavier density, of course, made a
division more vulnerable from the air (RG 24, Vol. 13,710, Appreciation by Lt.-
Gen. E. W. Sansom, DSO, GOC 2 Cdn Corps, 18 February 1943). The impression
is gained that McNaughton only dabbled superficially in the military art since his
admittedly superior performance in the Great War, which, it must not be forgotten,
was mainly in counter-battery work. When he went to Camberley after the war it
was reported that "much of the work which he ... [did] at the Staff College...
[was] new to him." Swettenham, McNaughton, I, 193.
7. Swettenham, McNaughton, II, 277, 286. There were not enough crossing sites
for three corps so the army commander went down himself to urge the engineers
on. Swettenham goes to extreme lengths to defend McNaughton's performance on
"Spartan," failing to mention several significant military aspects covered in the
GHQ Home Forces report. He himself does not seem to have appreciated the time-
space problem in issuing orders and instructions to large army formations. General
Omar N. Bradley, in ordering the redeployment of VII Corps from the Cherbourg
area in 1944, gave Lieutenant-General J. Lawton Collins "five days for the turna-
round of his corps: one for rest, two for the move, another for reconnaissance, and
a fifth on which to issue the attack orders." Bradley described it as a "tall order
even for 'Lightning Joe' Collins, a taller one for his troops." [Gen. Omar N. Bradley,
A Soldier's Story, (New York: Henry Holt, 1951), p. 319].

The Brooke entry cited is for 8 March 1943, which could be a mistake. He records
he "left at 9 AM
. to see "Spartan'." Stacey states McNaughton's diary "establishes
that General Brooke visited him on the morning of 7 March" [Col. C. P. Stacey,
Arms, Men and Governments: The War Policies of Canada, 1939-1945 (Ottawa: Infor-
mation Canada, 1974), p. 235). Swettenham's charge that Brooke bore a grudge
against McNaughton since the Great War seems to have been concocted by the
latter An examination of Brooke's diary from that period reveals he hardly men-
tioned McNaughton at all and then only in the most innocuous way. From a Brooke
fully prepared to record that Australian General Sir Thomas Blamey "looks entirely
drink sodden and somewhat repulsive" (LHC, AD, 5/8, May 5, 1944), one might
have expected more had he actually borne a grudge against McNaughton. Similar
evidence has heen produced by Gen sir David Easer. Alanhrooke (New York
Atheneum, 1982), p. 188.

the divisional level, 1 Corps movement appears to have worked well on "Spartan"
(GHQ Exercise "Spartan," March 1943 Comments by Commander-in-Chief GHQ
Home Forces March 1943).

that Stacey not include a quotation from them in the official history (CP, Vol. 21,

orders conferences when acting as enemy force on 12 British Corps's Exercise "Har-
old" in July 1942, he felt obliged to repeat this same message to all formations of the
Ist Canadian Corps in February 1943 (CP, Vol. 1, GOC 1-0 memorandum to distri-
