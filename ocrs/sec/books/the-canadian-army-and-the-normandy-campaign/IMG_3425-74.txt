tration between 1100-1300, and the live fire portion between 1500-1700. Forward
observation officers (FOOs) with infantry companies were to call down "on call'
targets, and smoke was employed to cover the movement of tanks. Only 15 rounds
of .303 ammunition per rifleman and 90-120 rounds per Bren were allocated. See

46 According to Calloway, without hatle drill the 1st Canadian Division could
not have done the job it did in Sicily a year later. He adds, however, that it did
little for the 2nd Division on the restrictive, deadly beaches of Dieppe (Galloway,
The General, p. 73).

and RG 24, Vol. 12,301, S.E. Army Exercise "Tiger' Final Conference, 4 June
1942. Remarks of Army Commander. On hearing a regular CO, Lt.-Col. Ber-
natchez of the Royal 22nd Regiment, complain that blisters were occurring because
boot leather was too hard, Montgomery noted that the boots had not been "dub-
bined." To his credit, Montgomery was greatly concerned about the weight (mainly
equipment and food) the infantryman carried. Since overloading detracted from
fighting performance, he recommended drastically limiting what was carried; he
further suggested that Canadian soldiers had to learn how to live on their service
rations alone. Montgomery considered it absurd that certain Canadian units allowed
the soldier to carry both greatcoat and blanket, some "carrying greatcoats on their
arms, as if out for a walk in the park." He consequently decreed that only one or
the other should be taken and that "the infantry soldier should not be required to
carry a greatcoat, or a blanket, into battle." To Montgomery, the "proper answer"
was to conduct, "careful investigation... to determine what a man can carry without
detracting from his proper fighting form. He should never carry one ounce more
than this." In his view, 40 pounds was the ideal for which to strive and 50 pounds
the absolute limit, as "there [was no reason why every platoon should carry into
every battle the whole of its ... equipment on every occasion." Men had to be trained
to go without either greatcoat or blanket for short periods, and he suggested that
a dry vest, dry shirt, cardigan, and pair of dry socks would be "the minimum to
keep him fit" (Ibid.; and CP, Vol. 2, Some Notes on the Broader Aspects of Beaver
II, 23 April 1942; and handwritten letter Montgomery to Crerar, 17 May 1942).

54. CP, Vol. 2, Exercise "Conqueror" notes under Montgomery to Crerar, 16
April 1942. Montgomery was evidently less acerbic than Fuller, who on observing
the disembarkation of the CEF in 1914 stated that Canadian soldiers would be good
chough after six months training "if the officers could be all shot" [Anthony John
Trytall, "Boney' Fuller: Soldier, Strategist, and Writer 1878-1966 (New Brunswick,
NJ.: Rutgers University Press, 1977), P. 33). He would later advise, however,
the proper way to get an American Army ready for battle is to teach the Generals.
It is no good having Battle Schools [as Alexander urged].. If they know their
stuff, they will teach the soldiers." Hamilton, Monty, Vol. Il: Master of the Battlefield
1942-1944 (Sevenoaks, U.K.: Hodder and Stoughton, 1987), Vol. II, p. 176.
