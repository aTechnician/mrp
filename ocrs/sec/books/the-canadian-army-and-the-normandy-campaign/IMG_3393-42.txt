Brown being somewhat of a Yankee-hating
"anachronism,
" his comments on
McNaughton "provide us with what is very invaluable in historical analysis: two
sides to the same story." It should also be borne in mind that Brown having lost
the struggle within the militia to the "brilliant and good CGS," was subsequently
portrayed, almost certainly unfairly, as a bigoted blockhead. There is evidence,
however, that Brown was a popular officer, a good leader, more interested in the
militia than McNaughton, and not necessarily alone without a following. He was
the second Canadian officer to attend IDC (Ibid., Pp. 9, 74-77). See also Charles
Taylor, Six Journeys: A Canadian Pattern (Toronto: Anansi, 1977), pp. 3-38, for a
more favorable view of Brown.
