February 1944 Report on 3 in Mortar Pls. Instances were brought to light where
COs were still employing mortars in single detachments, in one instance training
had even been undertaken where a detachment was sent out to train with a rifle
company. All platoons were short of equipment and that of one battalion needed
to be reorganized and trained for "one month free of duties."

Book Two
Half-Forgotten Summer
Three miles or so south of Caen the present-day tourist, driving down
the arrow-straight road that leads to Falaise, sees immediately to his
right a rounded hill crowned by farm buildings. If the traveler be Ca-
nadian, he would do well to stay the wheels at this point and cast his
mind back to the events of 1944; for the apparently insignificant em-
inence is the Verrières Ridge. Well may the wheat and sugar-beet grow
green and lush upon its gentle slopes, for in that now half-forgotten
summer the best blood of Canada was freely poured out upon them.
