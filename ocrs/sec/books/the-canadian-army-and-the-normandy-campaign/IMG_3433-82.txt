branch of the army and its weapons; he was expert at moving great numbers of
men and huge quantities of stores and vehicles at great speed across large distances;
above all, his personality was always good for the morale of his troops.... And,
provided he was in sole charge, he was good at commanding the troops of other
nations" (Lamb, Montgomery, p. 20). The "reports on individual Canadian brigades
which Montgomery sent to Crerar,'

a great trainer of troops at work." Col. C. P. Stacey, Arms, Men and Governments:

to McNaughton, 11 January 1942. McNaughton left Britain 23 January 1942, re-
turning on 28 March; the First Canadian Army was formed 6 April 1942. By Crera's
own admission, he had held no field command, whereas Pearkes had commanded
a brigade, a division, and now a corps: "as a com(man]d/er] he had a reputation-
as such I had none." On the basis of such obvious discrepancy, it is evident that
field command ability, if thought about at all, was assumed to be something that
automatically came with appointment. Not surprisingly, Crerar's relationship with
Pearkes was stormy. Whereas "the headquarters of the other divisions and for-
mations had invited me to dine with them," complained Crerar, "the Ist Division
had done no such thing." On 9 May 1942, he told Pearkes that during "the last
months his attitude had, perhaps unknowingly, made my position and our rela-
tionships extraordinarily difficult' (CP, Vol. 1, Crerar "Most Confidential" Note
to File, 9 May 1942). In the end Montgomery solved Crerar's problem.

1942 to 4 March 1942. Of the brigade commanders Montgomery commented upon,
H. L. N. Salmon of the 7th Brigade rated first: "a far better and more knowledgeable
soldier than any other Brigadier in the Corps," he was "fit to command a Division.
K. G. Blackader of the 8th Brigade was "excellent," a future division commander,
and the relief in the brigade "at seeing the last of Archambault [wals very evident.
Montgomery also considered G. V. Whitehead of the 5th Brigade a "good Briga-
dier" as he had a "good brain" and was firm and decisive. Southam of the 6th
Brigade was additionally "first class," while R. F. L. Keller of the 1st went unob-
served. H. N. Ganong and Haldenby, respectively of the 3rd and 9th Brigades,
were good though Montgomery later expressed reservations about the latter and
eventually recommended the relief of the former. A. E. Potts of the 2nd Brigade
and C. B. Topp of the 4th, while each a "nice person," were neither fitted for
brigade command. Of Topp, Montgomery wrote: "He does not hear a great deal
of what is said, and in consequence he does not know a great deal of what goes on
in his Brigade." While Potts, who commanded a brigade for six years in peace,
may have done good work in the past,
" Montgomery added, "he is beyond it
now.... He knows the officers in his Brigade, but beyond that he knows very little
ot what is going on" (Ibid). Montgomery also found Brig. R. A. Wyman of the
Ist Canadian Army Tank Brigade a "vigorous commander,
" who could with advice
be expected to perform well. He also noted that his Brigade Major, R. W. Moncel,
was "very good" (CP, Vol. 2, 1 Canadian army tank brigade notes, 7 May 1942).

wood," "lacks guts," and "is idle and taken to drink" about officers of British
formations [Imperial War Museum (hereafter IWM), Field Marshal Viscount Mont-
gomery of Alamein Papers (hereafter MAP), BLM 25, Notes on 4th Division, Notes
on 50th Division, and Notes on Portsmouth Area 25 July, 1940).

ment, the second, Lieutenant-Colonel Chouinard of the Le Régiment de la Chau-
die. The third CO mentioned was Lieutenant-Colonel G. H. Basher of the Royal
Regiment of Canada. The fou va cited, Major D. G. Maclauchlan, had been in
command for only two weeks having spent the previous "three months at the
of Clair Tizon in Normandy in August 1944. The last CO alluded to was Lieutenant-
Colonel Hendrie of the 48th Hichlanders Among those COs who impressed Mont-
gomery were: Sherwood Lett of the South Saskatchewan Regiment who replaced
