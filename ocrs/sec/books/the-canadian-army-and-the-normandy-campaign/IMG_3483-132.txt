D'Este, Decision in Normandy, pP. 232-251. Montgomery knew from ULTRA inter-
cepts that the 1st SS Panzer Division and 2nd SS Panzer Corps were moving toward
Caen. He had also been advised by the War Office before D-Day that it could guar-
antee replacements only for the first month; after that, he would have to break up di-
visions or ancillary troops.
The "British Army was a wasting asset" (D'Este,
Decision in Normandy, p. 237, 250). On the development of tactical air support, see

ories of War 1904-1945 (London: Allen and Unwin, 1982. pp. 260-273.

by 2nd SS Panzer Corps, which was soundly rebuffed. Hours later Dollmann poi-
soned himself (D'Este, Decision in Normandy, Pp. 241-242).

mans, which nonetheless caught fire so easily they were christened "Tommy Cook-
ers." Montgomery who believed in building a gun and putting a tank around it
personally pressed for the conversion of Shermans to Fireflies.

"Hitler Youth," 1943-1945 (San Jose, Calif.: Bender, 1987), pp. 127-142. According
to former Hauptsturmfuehrer Hans Siegel, 12th SS, he was ordered by his regimental
commander,
Standartenfuehrer Kurt Meyer to leave his tank and take a motorcycle
to reconnoiter forward for British tanks. Seigel, on locating the Canadian advance,
reported back to Meyer, who ran the battle from an observation post in the Abbaye

mfiltration attack, it does appear that three German companies put three defending
Canadian companies to Alight [Interview with Lt.-Col. (Waffen SS, retired) Hubert
Meyer, 6 March 1986]. Stacey also indicated as much. The Bren only fired 500
rounds per minute against the MG 42's 1,200.
