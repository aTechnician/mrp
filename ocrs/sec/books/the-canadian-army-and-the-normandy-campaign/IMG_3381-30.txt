largely at Canada's insistence, were exempted from the provisions of Locarno, which
through the Rhineland Pact provided a collective guarantee of the Franco-Belgian-
German border by France, Germany, Britain, Belgium, and Italy.

were 147,000 in the entire war) produced fear of the "knockout blow." For an

A Reappraisal (London: Jonathan Cape, 1975). In fairness to Liddell Hart, he did
not expect limited liability to starve the army of equipment; on the contrary, he
envisioned the establishment of a small, but highly mobile tank army capable of
intervening on the Continent at a critical juncture [Robert H. Larson,
Army and the Theory of Armored Warfare, 1918-1940 (Newark, Del.: University of

historians and deservedly so" because of his vacillation on army reform (Bidwell
