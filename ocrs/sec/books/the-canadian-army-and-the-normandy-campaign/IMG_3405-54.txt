Defence Scheme No. 3 as approved in 1932 anticipated an eventual force of seven
divisions, the size of that contemplated in 1919. There were over 190,000 Canadian
soldiers abroad on 31 March 1943. The manpower ceiling of the Canadian Army
overseas to 1 September 1943 was 232,100; in August 1944 the total was fixed at
234,500 all ranks (Stacey, Six Years, Pp. 31, 103). Canada's field force at the end of
the Second World War was roughly 170,000 strong: Currie commanded 110,000
of the 150,000 Canadian troops in France and Belgium during the Great War; the
total strength of the CEF in December 1918 was 342,648 |Col. C. P. Stacey, Official

First World War: Canadian Expeditionary Force 1914-1919 (Ottawa: Queen's Printer,

on manpower was 801,000; with 1,250,000 men and women engaged in war pro-
duction, this amounted to 17.2 percent of the total population [DHist 112.352009

decision to use the euphemistic CASF, later redesignated the Canadian Army (Ac-
tive) or CA(A), proved costly as it replaced edes tena " Canadian Field Force" on
all previously prepared mobilization documentation.

Great War. Rooted in the French word moral, state of discipline or spirit in armies,
there was argument over whether it should take a terminal "e" [Maj.-Gen. A. C.

were supposed to bridge the gap between training in Canada and the field, but as
admitted in memo HQ CRU to DCGS, 27 November 1944, this was impossible
without Canadian syllabi!

lished at Three Rivers, Quebec, and francophones were inducted through a facility
at St. Jérome. From 1 April 1941 to the end of the war, nearly two-thirds of army
officer vacancies were filled by men who had served in the ranks. British policy
from September 1939 decreed that all candidates for commissions, save in certain
technical and medical services, had to pass some time in the ranks. The British
established 35 OCTUs [Gen.
