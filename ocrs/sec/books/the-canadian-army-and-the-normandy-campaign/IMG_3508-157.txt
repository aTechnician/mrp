Half-Forgotten Summer
The Canadians only gradually learned of the immensity of this disaster
in the late afternoon of 9 August. The Poles whose tanks and artillery at
one point fired upon "Worthington Force"
until warned off by yellow
recognition smoke were unable to effect its rescue. Stalled at Estrées-la-
Campagne from about noon, they only managed to capture Soignolles the
which proved the final limit of their advance despite the exhor-
tations of Simonds. On the 4th Armoured Division front, meanwhile, the
connected hamlets of Langannerie and Grainville had fallen to the 10th
Brigade, which after last light on 9 August had pushed on toward Point
195. That night in what was probably the single most impressive action of
"Totalize," the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders under Lieutenant-Colo-
nel Dave Stewart seized the "Worthington Force"
objective without a
Stewart, who later claimed that he always tried to protect his unit from
"two enemies, The (sic) Germans and our own Higher Command, "* led
his Argylls silently and single file in a daring, but well-reconnoitered ap-
proach march to capture the Point 195 feature. Without having unduly
aroused the enemy, they were dug in and reorganized by first light on 10
August. When the surprised Germans eventually realized what had hap-
pened they reacted violently with a storm of shells and a series of strong
counterattacks. The Grenadiers who had been ordered to follow the Argylls
and exploit forward to the area of Point 206, were literally stopped in their
tracks by one such attack around noon. Shortly thereafter the Foot Guards
were ordered up to assist in the fighting, which continued for the rest of
the day. It was clear, however, that neither the Germans nor the Canadians
were going anywhere. Significantly, Stewart and his Argylls received hardly
an accolade for this action.
To break the resultant impasse and restore lost momentum, Simonds at
1000 hours ordered the 3rd Division to fight its way across the Laison River
east of Potigny to the ridge west of Epaney.
Given the 2nd Armoured
Brigade under command and supported by two AGRA as well as the Polish
divisional artillery, it was directed to attack at 1600 hours. The temporary
commander of the 3rd Division, Brigadier Blackader, assigned the task of
clearing Quesnay Wood to his 8th Brigade under the acting command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Jock Spragge. For various reasons, delays in artillery
coodination doubtless among them, this infantry attack did not go in until
2000 hours.
A fire plan of grouped concentrations on call was provided
from seven medium regiments and divisional artilleries.
The brigade attacked with two battalions up, the North Shores left and
the Queen's Own Rifles right, in a south easterly direction that took the
latter unit through Quesnay village.
At first all went well and the lead
Queen's Own company crossed a 150-yard cleared space on the edge of the
wood with little opposition. When two following companies crossed it,
however, the Germans opened fire with tanks, small arms, and mortars.

The North Shores, though greeted similarly, were driven out of the woods
mainly by friendly shell fire. In reporting on this disastrous attack, the
acting brigade commander complained that there had not been enough time
for reconnaissance or to study artillery tasks. Information on the enemy
was also considered "scanty" and not
"sufficient upon which to make a
sound detailed plan," which meant that artillery fire should have been more
intense." Indeed, the 8th Brigade attack appears to have been bloodily
repulsed by the bulk of Panzerkampfgruppe Wunsche as well as Kampfgruppe
Krause 52 "Totalize" had fizzled out.

does appear, however, that the German three-quarter-tracked Sdkfz 251 issued
before the war was, in fact, the first successful APC. See Richard E. Simpkin,
Mechanized Infantry (Oxford: Brassey's, 1980), PP. 15, 22, 31. It is not the track that
makes an APC, but the protection and cross-country mobility it offers to infantry;
today, wheeled APCs are common.
The U.S. White M3 half-track,
also used by
Canadian forces, had limited cross-country performance.
