," seven panzer divisions (2nd, 216,
116th, and 1st, 9th, 10th, and 12th SS) with a total of 645 tanks faced the Second
British Army; of these, all but the 10th SS and elements of the 2nd and Ith SS
Panzer were east of the Orne. On the U.S. front, there were two panzer divisions
of about 190 tanks. About 60 infantry battalions opposed the First U.S. Army on

was reinforced with a panzer battalion from the 2nd Panzer, a panzer grenadier
battalion from the 9th SS, and a reconnaissance battalion from the 10th SS. The 9ih
SS and 2nd Panzer remained in close reserve and within striking distance respectively.
The movement of the 2nd Panzer east from Caumont had gone undetected (bil),

Zealand Division employed the barrage as their normal method of arillery suppor.
With a preferred density of one gun per 20 yards and a usual depth of abou 4,00
yards, it took about 12 hours to prepare after receipt of the division commanders
orders. In the opinion of one brigade commander, "provided the troops understood
a barrage and kept right up to it, an attack under a barrage seldom failed." (Pen-
berton, Artillery Tactics, p. 279). Canadians began to feel that only 25 percent of
artillery resources should be emploved on the barrage. leaving the other 65 percent
available to deal with outside but relevant enemy positions (Personal Copy CLFCS
Collection, 8th Cdn Inf Bde Barrage in the Attack).

that the battalion was fired on from behind as it crossed the start line, stating that
it was probably due "to some plunging fire" being mistaken for fire coming from
the rear, "a very common battle error" (RG 24, Vol. 12,745, Confidential Memo
