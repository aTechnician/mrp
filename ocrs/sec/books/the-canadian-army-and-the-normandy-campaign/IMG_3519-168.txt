on 21 August. Hutchinson charges that the 4th Armoured Division, which had been
given the 2nd Armoured and 9th Infantry Brigades under command, reacted too
slowly on 20 August (Hutchinson, "Corps Commander," Pp. 229-242). It may be
that Kitching was also fired for his performance on "Totalize" and "Tractable."

Conclusion
Final Casting
The Army is not like a limited liability company, to be reconstructed,
remodeled, liquidated and refloated from week to week as the money
market fluctuates. It is not an inanimate thing, like a house, to be pulled
down or enlarged or structurally altered at the caprice of the tenant or
the owner; it is a living thing. If it is bullied, it sulks; if it is unhappy,
it pines; if it is harried it gets feverish; if it is sufficiently disturbed it
will wither and dwindle and almost die; and when it comes to this
serious condition, it is only to be revived by lots of time and lots of

The operational strategic and political consequences of a Canadian triumph
in Normandy are impossible to know. Had the First Canadian Army suc-
ceeded in its 8 August drive to Falaise, however, it is not unreasonable to
presume that it might have, as in 1918, spearheaded the British Army's
advance into the heartland of Europe. The tragedy was that on the morning
of the 26th anniversary of the Battle of Amiens, Simonds's corps had cleanly
sliced open the German defensive zone without realizing it.
this did with Hitler's ill-advised counter attack at Mortain the previous day,
an immediate push would have caught the Germans in full stride, unable
to avoid the utter calamity of such an exploitation.
Here indeed was the
opportune juncture at which to have initiated an encirclement, for it would
have allowed sufficient time to interpose ample Allied force. In fulfillment
of the legacy of the Canadian Corps, the sword would have won for Canada
a greater stature than all the machinations of constitutionally minded gen-
erals and diplomats. After "Totalize the same opportunity did not exist.
