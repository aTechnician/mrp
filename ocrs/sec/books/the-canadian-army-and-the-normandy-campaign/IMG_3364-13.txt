Prologue
Of Ignorant Armies
"Write the history of a battle? As well write the history of a ball." So
growled the Duke of Wellington' in what surely has come to be recognized,
historiographically, as a perceptive assessment. Similarly, Count Leo Tol-
stoy brilliantly argued in the second part of his epilogue to War and Peace
that "there was no possibility of describing the movement of humanity"
without taking into account "the history of all, without one exception, all
the people taking part in an event." Clearly, in the writing of history,
particularly military history that deals with the movement of masses of men
within limited space and time frames, one can only aim at the most rudi-
mentary reconstruction of past events.
The historian is thus challenged like
some benighted staff officer at a distant headquarters to piece together as
reasonably accurate a picture as possible from the "confused alarms of
struggle and flight."3
It has been further asserted that the writer who lacks personal experience
of combat cannot know what happens on the battlefield. In his latter-day
account of infantry life in the Great War, veteran front line soldier W.H. A
Groom takes issue with the work of "front rank historian" John Terraine
on the grounds that he "was not in the war and has no knowledge of the
mental strain of the front line."4 Yet, as Sandhurst historian Paddy Griffith
sensibly counters, "no one man in battle can see very much of what is going
on, nor will he have the leisure to weigh the significance of what he does
see." He concludes that, in fact, the
"vast majority of battles leave... but
few useful eyewitness accounts,
and it is rare for any two observers to
describe exactly the same event." No less revealing is Arthur Swinson's
discovery in the course of researching the battle of Kohima of "more than
once. instances where both parties were convinced that they were on the
