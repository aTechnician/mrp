Simonds 12 August 1944; and Stacey, Victory Campaign, pp. 175-176. The SSR were
ordered to occupy the reverse slope, but the grid reference given them was forward.
The ground in this area is very flat and open and almost all reverse slope, however,
and dangerously exposed to the crest at Fontenay-le-Marmion, held by the Germans.

had trained with the 3rd Division from July 1943, supposedly found 2nd Division
troops "jumpy, nervous, and green" (Copp and Vogel, Falaise, pp. 44-45). Ac-
cording to the War Diary of 21st Army Group, total casualties for 8 Corps were
1,818, for 2 Canadian, 1,614 (D'Este, Decision in Normandy, p. 385). Stacey gives
the "total casualties of all Canadian units in the theatre of operations, for the four-
day's fighting" as 1,965 in all categories.

Cold Eye on Death
It has been a source of deep regret to me that a fine battalion like the
Black Watch suffered so heavily in.. (Operation "Spring"]. I would
prefer to make no statement on the subject for I dislike even suggesting
criticism of those who lost their lives, but if a statement is required
from me as a matter of record, I consider that the losses were unnec-
essarily heavy and the results achieved disappointing. Such heavy losses
were not inherent in the plan nor in its intended execution. The action
of the Black Watch was most gallant but was tactically unsound in its
detailed execution.

croneously as it turned out, that the "Goodwood" onslaught had left the
Germans on their last legs. As he later stated, however,
"nobody had been
optimistic enough to believe the Germans would fight south of the Seine.
The expectation was that once all hope of liquidating the bridgehead faded
they would pull back to that riverline; hence the requirement for Operation

from the oberational policy he made exblicit soon after taking over 2 Ca

Dempsey and Montgomery, also provides substantial insight into the pre-

Worth examining in some depth.
