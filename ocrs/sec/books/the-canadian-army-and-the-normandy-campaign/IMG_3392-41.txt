Long Forgotten Winters
were to plague Canadian arms five years later. Not surprisingly, interarm
cooperation remained the major problem and, significantly, gunners and
support services seem to have performed best. A few light tanks, armored
cars, and modern antitank guns and artillery pieces were also employed for
the first time. 4
The primary focus of the general staff on defense planning and nonmil-
itary pursuits over the years contributed to this professional malaise because
it detracted from training the militia as a fighting force. For this, Mc-
Naughton must largely bear responsibility. The lack or unsatisfactory nature
of collective training further nudged the average reserve force officer toward
a more traditional, regimental disposition and the regular officer toward
higher staff work and the heady arena of imperial defense. To be sure, the
path to career success for the latter definitely led through the IDC, which
was generally recognized as the senior military institution. Yet, as estab-
lished by Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond, the IDC aimed chiefly at im-
proving interservice collaboration within a strategic context, giving due
consideration to the diplomatic, economic, and political dimensions of an
oceanic empire.
75 The strategic and regimental twin attractions, it must be
concluded, ensured the general neglect of the operational and tactical sphere
of war in militia training.
The dilettantish nature of the Canadian military establishment, increased
by frequent officer transfers, further exerted an amateurish pull on those
who chose simply to drift, buffeted by the system.? To one who broke
out in the politico-strategic direction, the "Canadian military were not
soldiers, though... many [were] experts on King's dress regulations...
[who]... spent their time on hour-to-hour management and administra-
tion, not on matters of higher staff training or the like.
»77 Fortunately for
Canada there were individual militia officers who. like Montgomery, with-
stood of their own volition professional compromise.
The recent graduates
of Camberley and Quetta staff colleges also generally fell into this category,
protected by their very youth from fouling. The high command, on the
prote hand, was really incapable of training the militia for operations on
the battlefield simoly because due to long neelect of this important area,
it had little to teach.
