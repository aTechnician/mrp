a bowling-green. French card-games are different from'
ours and they are often played in an atmosphere of
considerable excitement.
THE RULE OF THE ROAD.—You drive on the
right of the road and NOT on the left. The main
roads are straight and good, the side-roads are variable as
our own. France to-day, thanks to the Germans, contains
an undue proportion of the very old and the very young;
the able-bodied have been largely deported. So do not
drive through French towns and villages at a rate which
means the inhabitants skipping out of your way. They
may not be able to do so!
BEHAVIOUR.—The British Army represents in France
to-day the British people. Any errors of conduct commit-
ted by individual soldiers will remain in French minds
not simply as slur on a single man or a single unit but as
"the way the British behave".
At the present time, owing to the effects of the Ger-
man occupation, the French have suffered very much,
and so are apt to be sensitive. It is up to us to show that
little extra consideration which makes the difference
between mere good will and real friendliness.
The French people, like our own, include both good
and bad characters. You will be fortunate if you meet only
the good Frenchmen; so do not grouse at the French in
general if you should met a French "bad hat". There are
probably one or two "bad hats" in every British unit.
The French will greet you on your arrival as a wel-
come and long-expected guest of their country. The
good guest retains his welcome by making himself as
little trouble as possible and doing all he can to help his
hosts. If you can do this, you will be acting as a good
Ally should; and in the process you may be increasing
your own comfort.
