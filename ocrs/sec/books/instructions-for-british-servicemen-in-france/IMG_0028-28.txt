MONEY-
FRENCH MONEY is reckoned on the decimal system,
i.e. in tens. It is very simple to remember that 100
centimes go to a franc, and you will be told how many
francs go to a f. The only complication you are likely to
run across is that country people often count small sums,
up to five francs, in "sous", that is five centimes; so "20
sous" will mean a franc, "roo sous" five francs.
• All recent French coins have been made of aluminium
or brass, but you are likely to get paper money for even
the smallest sums. The Germans withdrew all the coins
they could to make munitions.
There will be little at first for you to buy. When the
time comes for buying things, try not to spend your
money in a way which would encourage the old belief on
the Continent that all Englishmen are both wealthy and
foolish. Don't be mean, but don't be extravagant
either; if you are the prices are bound to go up,
which would be bad luck on the local popula-
tion and do you no good either.
-DO'S
The French are our friends. The Germans are our en-
emies and the enemies of France. Remember that the
Germans individually often behaved well in France. We
have got to behave better.
We are helping to free France. Thousands of Frenchmen
have been shot in France for keeping alive the spirit of
freedom. Let the French know that you realize the great
part Frenchmen have played, both in the last war and
in this war.
The French are more polite than most of us. Remember,
to call them "Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle", not
just "Oy!"
Be patient if you find a Frenchman hard to understand
he is having difficulties too.
Remember to salute a French civilian or policeman when
you address them. This is a normal form of politeness
practised by. the French. Salute when entering and leav-
ing a private house, a café, or a shop.
Be natural, but don't make yourself too much at home
till you are sure your French friends like it. Remember
the intense suffering of the French since 1940. Make
allowances for this.
