Second Republic whose President, Louis-Bonaparte,
had himself made Emperor under the title of Napoleon
3rd in 1852. During the Second Empire, France laid the
foundations of her modern colonial Empire, which was
later added to and consolidated under the Third Republic.
The Second Empire came to and end with Napoleon's
abdication in 1870 after the disastrous France-Prussian
war (the first of those three German invasions which
Frenchmen still living to-day can remember, and which
explain the deep-rooted fear and hatred of Germany
throughout France). Since that date, and until the setting
up of the Vichy régime in 1940, France has lived under
the Third Republic.
By comparison with the outwardly settled forms of
British government during the same period, the history
of France in the nineteenth century consisted of a series
of political upheavals. But underneath all the changes
of government the live forces of French democracy
remained strong and active. Universal suffrage, intro-
duced in 1848, came earlier in France than in Britain
and survived all the anti-democratic measures of the
Second Empire. Political and personal liberty, fought for
in a series of bitter struggles, remain vital possessions
for Frenchmen. Attempts to interfere with either meet
unfailingly with a vigorous reaction. Of the original
slogan of the French Revolution, "liberty" and "equality"
18
have never ceased to preoccupy Frenchmen, often at the
expense of national "fraternity"
