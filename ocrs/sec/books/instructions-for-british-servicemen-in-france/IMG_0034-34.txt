Area
1 Hectare
1 Hectare
To convert hectares into acres multiply by 5 divide by 2
(1 acre = two-fifths hectare.)
= nearly 2½ acres
Liquid Capacity
titre
1 Litre
1¼ pints
To convert litres into pints add half, and then a half of the half
(¼ pints = just over half a litre.)
To convert litres into gallons divide by 5
(1 gallon = 4½ litres.)
Heat
The measurement used is called Centigrade, by which water freezes at o degrees
(instead of our 32° Fahrenheit) and boils at 100° (instead of our 21 2° Fahrenheit).
Normal body temperature is 37°
To convert Centigrade into Fahrenheit double, subtract onetenth of the result and
add 32. (100° F. = about 38°.)
-SECURITY NOTE
Now is the time for you to realize that all that you have
learnt about security during your training at home applies
with equal force to operations overseas. In fact, those of
you who have already seen foreign service will be able to
tell the others that security is, for the reasons that follow,
even more important overseas than in the U.K
One of the most important reasons for this is that
you have moved and will continue to move into areas
which have been occupied by the enemy for a long time.
The enemy will spare no pains to leave behind,
scattered among the civilian population, agents,
saboteurs and propagandists who will be a con-
tinual threat to our security.
Their numbers will greatly exceed anything with
which we have had to cope in the past and it will be
infinitely more difficult to detect them. Added to this, the
enemy will have prepared channels of communications
for the use of his agents, and which he may well be able
to use long after actual hostilities have ceased.
those areas where the battle has moved on and
comparatively peaceful conditions may prevail.
In these areas particularly you must be on your
guard.
