-WEIGHTS AND MEASURES
These are based on the decimal Metric System used in
most European countries. This is simpler than our British
system, since units are all multiples of ten. The equivalents
given are approximate only-for quick reckoning.
Length
1 Centimetre (cm.)
1 Centimètre
= two-fifths of an inch
1 Metre (m = 100 cms.)
1 Mètre
= 3ft. 3ins.
1 Kilometre (km = 1,000 m.) 1 Kilometre
= five-eights of a mile
To convert centimetres into inches multiply by 4 and divide the result by 1o
(1 inch = 2½ cms, 1 foot = 3o cms.)
To convert metres into yards
-add one-ninth the number of metres*
(1 yard = nine-tenths of a metre)
To convert kilometres into miles divide the kms. by 8 and multiply the result by 5
(1 mile = just over 1½ kms.)
Weight
1 Gramme
1 Gram (g.)
1 Kilogram (kg. = 1,000 gs.)
1 Kilogramme (or
= 15½ grains
= 2 lb. 3 oz.
Kilo.)
1 Tonne
1,016 kilos.
1 Ton
To convert kilograms into pounds double and then add one-tenth of the result
(1 lb. = roughly half a kilo, r ewt. = 50 kilos.)
