"You may be sure that France will rise again free, united, and
independent, to stand on guard with others over the generous
tolerances and brightening opportunities of the human society
we mean to rescue and rebuild."
MR. CHURCHILL
(Aug. 3 1st, 1943)
This book has nothing to do with military operations. It
deals only with civilian life in France and with the way
you should behave to the French civilian population.
