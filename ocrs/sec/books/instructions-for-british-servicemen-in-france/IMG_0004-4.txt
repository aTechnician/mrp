PREFACE
A draft of this pamphlet, stamped 'Confidential' and called 'Soldiers'
Guide to France', survives, alongside a copy of the work as published,
in the papers of the journalist Herbert David Ziman, which were given
to the Bodleian in 1995 by his daughters, Elizabeth Ziman and Naomi
Roberts. Ziman was on the staff of the Daily Telegraph for 35 years, as
leader-writer, war correspondent and finally, from 1956 to 1968, as
literary editor and special correspondent throughout the world. Having
served with the Artists' Rifles for four years before the outbreak of
war, he was called up in September 1939 and joined the Middlesex
Regiment. We learn from a curriculum vitae which he drew up in 1947
that, during secondment from the Intelligence Corps to the French
Section of the Political Warfare Executive in 1943, he wrote the little
pamphlet on France issued to troops for the invasion'.
It is a remarkable little pamphlet, demonstrating both a wide-
ranging knowledge of France and a deep sympathy for the French
people. The opening quotation from Churchill in August 1943 on the
certainty of France rising again 'free, united and independent', sets
the scene for what follows: the upbeat summaries of French history
and geography, the lively survey of national and regional character-
istics, the section of useful French phrases (of which only a flavour
is given here), the conversion of metric measures, the explanation
of road signs and the final grave warning about the risk of sabotage
