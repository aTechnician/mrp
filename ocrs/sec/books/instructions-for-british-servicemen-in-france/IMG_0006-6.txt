As a document reflecting the enduring problems of war, oc-
cupation and invasion, the pamphlet continues to be of interest long
after it has served its original purpose. In particular for the millions of
British who, since the end of the Second World War have holidayed
or settled in France, it offers a fascinating glimpse of France herself
and of British attitudes to France at a crucial time in the history
of both countries, an instructive guide against which to measure
contemporary cross-Channel relations.
