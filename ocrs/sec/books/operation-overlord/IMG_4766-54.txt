stem reverses on other fronts, defenses on the English Chan-
nel coasts of France and Belgium were,
on the contrary,
strengthened, operation "Rankin" was shelved. Planning and
preparations, which had been proceeding without interruption
anyway, were now (in the spring of 1944) devoted exclu-
sively to "Overlord" —the grand invasion against
stubborn
enemy resistance.

DESIGN FOR CROSSING THE NARROW SEA
The "Neptune" Initial Joint Plan
Shortly after the strategic Overlord Outline Plan was ap-
proved by the Quebec Conference in August 1943, Head-
quarters COSSAC advised the three tactical commanders of
the invasion-the Commander-in-Chief 21 Army Group, the
Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief Expeditionary Force, and
the Commander-in-Chief Allied Expeditionary Air Force-
to work out a joint tactical plan for the crossing of the Eng-
lish Channel and the assault on the Normandy beaches, using
the "Overlord"
plan as a working basis.
The three commanders,
collectively known as the "Nep-
tune" Joint Commanders, after the code name given to the
first phase of the projected invasion, completed their basic
planning on February 1, 1944. They called their tactical plan
the "Neptune Initial Joint Plan.
After undergoing some
modification the plan reached its
final form on May 13,1
except for last-minute changes on the lower echelons of com-
mand, for which allowance was made. The "Neptune"
plan
in turn served as a basis for
planning of the First United
States and Second British Armies and the several corps under
their command.
The proposed "Neptune" operation was in many ways dif-
ferent from any preceding similar undertaking. In the First
World War the land base for operations against
Germany
already existed
