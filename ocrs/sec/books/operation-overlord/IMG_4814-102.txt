So stubborn was the fight that on the first day of battle alone
German tanks and 88-mm guns accounted for 150 British-
Canadian tanks put out of action.
Then the German High
Command at last began to move some of its infantry
divi-
sions from the Pas-de-Calais in an
effort to reinforce the
Normandy battle area. But, as that decision was taken rather
late, and because of limited transport facilities, these divisions
arrived slowly and were committed to battle piecemeal.
As
a result, they failed to affect the strategic outcome of "Over-
lord." Moreover, the breakthrough which the First United
States Army launched on July 25 took place on a sector of
the front the Germans least expected that event to occur.'
Breakthrough at St. Lo
The breakthrough at St.
Lo was originally intended to
coincide with the offensive of the Second British Army on
July 18, but was at first postponed to the 24th on account of
bad weather, which interfered with the plans of the Eighth
Air Force to bomb tactical targets before the ground opera-
tion was begun. It was again postponed to the 25th because
of cloud and thick mist over the target area, which had sent
2,000 daylight bombers back to base in England
without
dropping their loads on the target. On July 25 the ground
offensive moved off at eleven in the morning. (See Map 7.)
The offensive was preceded by
heavy
air attacks on the
American VII Corps sector of the front, just after the front
line troops had been withdrawn about three-quarters
of a
mile to the rear of the forward edge of the target area. Some
400 fighter bombers raided a strip of 300 yards along the
St. Lo-Perriers road,
followed by 1,500 Eighth Air Force
bombers in a saturation attack. Then the VII Corps advanced
across the road,
dented the enemy positions, and its leading
divisions-
_the 4th,
9th, and 30th—began to fan out to the
left and right in order to establish the flanks of the break-
through. Through the corridor thus formed the 2d and 3d
