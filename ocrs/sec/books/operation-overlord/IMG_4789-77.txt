Chapter 10
SEA POWER AND AIR POWER
Fundamental to the success of the invasion of France and
the winning of the war was the possession by the Allies of
superior sea power with which to defeat the German sub-
marine menace in the Atlantic Ocean. Next in importance
(aside from well-balanced ground forces), but contingent
upon sea power,
was the possession of superior air power.
In order to make the invasion of the European continent
possible it was therefore considered necessary to carry out
preparatory sea
and air operations against the Germans-
the former, in order to secure Allied sea communications to
Europe; the latter, in
order to destroy the
German
war
economy and the will of the German people to continue in
the war.
In the
case of sea operations, Allied measures
proved sufficiently effective so that by late 1943 the German
submarine no longer
constituted a grave threat to Allied
intentions.' In the case of air operations, the strategic bomber
offensive travelled a somewhat tortuous course of trial and
wide gaps between theory and
reality.?
