Design for the Drive Inland

consolidated by about D+12, and that between then and
the expansionist drive inland a sufficient number of combat
divisions and stocks of supplies would have been moved to
the Continent for a rapid exploitation of the early gains.
Operational plans forecast a build-up at the end of D+12
of 18 divisions-nine American and nine British-Canadian;
and on D+22, 28 divisions—13 American and 15 British-
Canadian. On D+60 the total would reach 34 divisions-
16 American and 18 British-Canadian, the latter including
one Polish armored division; and on D+90, at the
con-
clusion of "Overlord," 38. Of these, 21 were to be American
divisions and the remaining 17 British-Canadian divisions.*
The general deployment of the Allied forces, facing east-
ward, was to be: Canadian units on the left flank, along the
Channel coast; to the south and abreast of the Canadians,
British units would be in line; and still farther south, resting
their southernmost (right) flank on the Loire, United States
units. Tactical air support was to be provided the British-
Canadian forces by the 2d Tactical Air Force of the Royal
Air Force and the American forces by the Ninth United
States Air Force.
Great importance was attached by the
invasion planners
to ports in Brittany, through which logistical support would
be provided the American forces. The possibility of air and
seaborne landings on the north coast of the Brittany Pen-
insula, near Morlaix, was therefore given serious considera-
tion, in the event American forces were
unable to break
into Brittany from the mainland. An attack was then planned
on Brest,
in order to capture and develop the city as a
major port of supply. Should that succeed, there would no
longer
exist the need to capture Nantes and St. Nazaire,
should German resistance prove too strong to be overcome
in a reasonably short time.
