Operation Overlord: Part 1
52
operation "Pluto," the abbreviated form of "pipeline under
the ocean."
The delivery of petroleum products to the forces in France
prior to the laying of the pipeline was solved by providing
a tanker shuttle service between England and Normandy.
The "Overlord" planners arranged to have oil tankers stand
ofishore, short lengths of submarine pipe connecting with
storage facilities on the Normandy coast. Special units were
trained to land either on D-day or D+1 to erect the oil
storage facilities.
The questions of technology and techniques, the very warp
and woof of the "Overlord"
plan, which at every turn in
the planning came up for solution, had at last been solved.
The interlocking strategic and tactical aspects of an invasion
of the European continent had been reconciled. Little,
anything, was left to chance, except chance itself-the awful
intruder. There now remained only the question of definitively
settling the proper organization and interrelationships of the
higher commands, both in the intra-American as well as the
inter-Allied sphere, in order that detailed planning
could
proceed without interruption.
