north of Paris. Still other forces would drive forward on an
even wider arc, toward Laval, Le Mans, Orleans, and points
south of Paris on the Seine.3
Reorganization to Exploit the Breakthrough
In order to
exploit the
breakthrough and unfold the
strategic plan, there was aded to 21 Army Group (late in
July) the First Canadian Army, General H.G.D. Crerar
commanding. To it were assigned the Canadian Il Corps and
the British I Corps, with position nearest the English Channel.
The Second British Army retained the British VIII, XII, and
XXX Corps. Similarly, on August 1, 12th Army Group, Gen-
eral Omar N. Bradley commanding, became operational. It
too consisted of two armies: The First United States Army,
relinquished by 21 Army
Group, and the Third United
States Army, Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr. com-
manding, which became operational the same day. The Third
Army assumed command of the American VIII Corps, which
the First Army relinquished, and the newly-arrived American
XII, XV, and XX Corps. The remaining three American
corps-V, VII, and XIX-were retained by the First Army,
now under the command of Lieutenant General Courtney H.
Hodges. The 12th Army Group came under the tactical con-
trol of 21 Army Group for the duration of "Overlord," how-
ever, since General Bernard L. Montgomery, its commander-
in-chief, continued to the end of that campaign as over-all
Allied ground force commander.
General
Montgomery's
responsibility was to the Supreme Allied Commander, General
of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The Effort to Trap the Germans
The breakthrough west of St. Lo was one of major propor-
tions. (See Map 8.) With little or no immediate reserves to
