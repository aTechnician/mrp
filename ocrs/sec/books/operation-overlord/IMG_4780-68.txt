forcing the Germans to commit their reserves there and to fight
the main battle. General Bradley's 12th Army Group, with the
First and Third United States Armies under its command,
would then deliver a concerted
blow southward
toward
Laval, Nantes, and
Angers but would,
at the
same time,
gradually be swinging
eastward, ending in a wide sweep
up the Seine about Paris.1 The intention was to cut off all,
or most, of the enemy forces south and west of the Seine,
whose escape would be hampered by the destruction of the
bridges over the river by Allied bombing. Secondary opera-
tions were simultaneously to be developed westward into
Brittany with the object of capturing
and
developing its
ports, especially Brest, so that additional troops and supplies
could be brought from the United States direct to the Con-
tinent. The entire campaign was to be concluded by D+90.
It was anticipated that by that time Allied troops would have
crossed the Seine in strength, taken Paris, and be regrouping
for an advance to the Somme and the German frontier.2
This strategy was evolved to a
considerable degree from
the desire to obtain ports. Despite the artificial harbors, ports
were considered essential to the development of the
cam-
paign involving increasingly larger ground and air forces.
The capture of Cherbourg and Brest required that the ground
forces make rapid progress in the west.
The acquisition of
ground on the eastern flank of the beachhead was not con-
sidered pressing during the first stages of the invasion, al-
though the air forces argued for the capture
of the good
airfield country southeast of Caen. To assure the success of
this strategy, the enemy forces had to be kept away from
the western sector of the beachhead and kept on the eastern
sector.
It was anticipated that the initial beachhead would be
