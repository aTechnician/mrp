its solution. The controversies which the strategic problem en-
gendered are also treated. Next follows the United States Army
and Allied command organization for the invasion and the plan-
ning for translating the strategic idea into a workable operational
plan that would reasonably guarantee success. Finally, the story
of the invasion itself is told: The assault on the Normandy coast
of France on June 6, 1944; the fighting for the expansion of the
beachhead; the breakout from the beachhead and encirclement of
the German forces west of the Orne River; the pursuit of the
Germans to Paris and the Seine, and the crossing of the river in
late August and early September, ending the campaign already
known in history as Operation "Overlord." In a final chapter are
reviewed some of the lessons of the war in western Europe and the
relative contribution to the Allied victory of the several arms and
services.
In writing this story I have, in the main, laid greater emphasis
on the events and their unfolding. Interpretation I have generally
left to the judgment of the reader, for I believe that the truth,
once known and accurately presented, speaks for itself. However,
I have made no attempt to leave unnoticed the influence of motives
and of leadership-or their absence-wherever they noticeably
made themselves felt.
