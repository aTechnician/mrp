divisions
continued to
pivot north of the Falaise-Argentan battle area. (See Map 10.)
Chartres was entered on August 16, and Orleans and Dreux
the next day. On August 19, the 79th Infantry Division of
XV Corps reached the left bank of the Seine near Mantes
Gasicourt, above Paris, and immediately established a small
bridgehead
over the river. Fontainebleau, below the capital,
fell on the
20th.10 Just below the
Argentan battlefront the
First United States Army swept north from a line extending
west from Dreux in the direction of Rouen. Its objective was
to prevent a German escape to the river ferries, all bridges
over the Seine having been blown out by the Allied air forces.
On August 25, the American XIX Corps,
moving
rapidly
across the front of the Second British Army, took the river
town of Elbeuf, below Rouen, where it made contact with
the Canadian II Corps of the First Canadian Army. The Can-
adians thereupon relieved the American troops in that area.
Threatened with encirclement,

the
Germans withdrew. Allied troops, led by the V Corps' French
2d Armored Division, entered Paris on August 25.
Nearer the English Channel, British and Canadian forces
closed in on the Seine, occupying its entire length northwest
of Paris. Rouen was seized on August 30, as American troops
withdrew south from the area,
and near the mouth of the
Seine the British I Corps of the First Canadian Army had
reached the general area of Quillebeuf on the 27th of August.
Throughout the breakthrough, encirclement, and pursuit to
the Seine, Allied tactical and strategic air forces were very
active. The river ferries, the only means of escape left to the
Germans, were under constant air attack.
Bodies of enemy
troops. however, managed to escape across the river, after
hiding out in the river bends and forests.
The greater part
of the troops not trapped or destroyed in the Falaise Pocket
the Germans pulled back to the right bank of the Seine. None-
