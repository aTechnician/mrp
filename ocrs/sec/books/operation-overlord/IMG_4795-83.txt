D-day assembly phase for Operation "Neptune."
The Invasion of France
151
arranged waves to a line called the line of departure, some
three-quarters of a mile to two miles off the French coast.
From the line of departure the landing craft moved off to
assault the beaches.' To mark the approaches to the beaches,
some midget submarines, called "X"
craft, were placed off
the Normandy coast to mark the limits of the assault area.
On the day before D-day they fixed their positions, then lay
on the bed of the sea until the assault forces were approaching
the coast of France. On the morning of June 6 they flashed
shaded lights to seaward from the surface in order to guide
the invasion craft in to their beaches.?
The Armada Under Way
The invasion armada of the initial assault forces comprised
some 4,200 landing ships and craft, besides the many war-
ships, tugs, ferries, and so on. Flanking them along the stretch
of sea from the French coast to the transport
area were
battleships, cruisers, destroyers,
rocket ships, and
support
gunboats.
United States invasion troopships lay off the western half
of the "Neptune"
invasion area,
running from the fishing
village of Port-en-Bessin westward.
British and Canadian
forces hovered off the eastern half of the invasion coast
stretching from Port-en-Bessin eastward to the mouth of the
Orne. These forces were supported by numerous British,
American, Canadian and French warships.?
Until the invasion beaches were made safe, the transport
area remained the heart of the invasion. The two naval task
force commanders and the commanding generals of the two
assaulting armies were located there. While afloat, over-all
responsibility was exercised by Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay,
the Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief.
