down the German reserves on the eastern flank of the Allied
front, where space counted for little in the over-all strategic
plan. The constant pressure
on the enemy's most sensitive
sector and the tenacious attrition of his
dwindling
armor
gave the First United States
Army the opportunity to get
into position for the massive
assault which,
late in July,
resulted in the breakout from the beachhead and the pur-
suit and virtual destruction of the Seventh
German Army
which had manned the defenses in Normandy. The Second
British Army had
been
considerably
strengthened
in the
meantime.
To its other three
corps
had been
added the
Canadian II Corps and the British XII Corps. The Army
thus stood poised for further operations in conjunction with
the breakout as follows: On the extreme east, and resting on
the English Channel, I Corps; next, from east to west,
VIII
Corps, the Canadian II Corps, XII Corps, and XXX Corps,
where contact was maintained with the First United States
Army's V Corps. All in all, the entire 21 Army Group was
ready for the next phase of the campaign with 23 infantry
and seven armored divisions and their supporting units, aside
from the air and service forces. There were 15 of these
divisions in the First United States Army and 15 in the
Second British Army. Against this the Germans opposed
21 infantry and eight armored divisions two armored divi-
sions, with an estimated total of 190 tanks,
opposing the
First United. States Army, and six armored divisions, with
an estimated total of 645 tanks, the Second British Army.5
Because of the reduced strength of their units,
however,
German strength was no more than the equivalent of 10
full-strength infantry and six armored divisions.
Additional
German forces, not directly opposing
"Overlord," were lo-
cated in the south of France. Still waiting for an invasion
of the Pas-de-Calais, across the Straits of Dover was, sub-
stantially intact, the Fifteenth German Army of some 20
divisions.
