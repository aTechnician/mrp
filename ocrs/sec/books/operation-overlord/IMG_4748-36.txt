UNITED STATES ARMY ORGANIZATION IN EUROPE
The COSSAC "Overlord" plan for the invasion of France
contemplated the employment of Allied ground forces on an
increasingly bigger scale as the campaign in western Europe
progressed. During the first weeks of the invasion it was
planned that United States and British-Canadian forces would
be about equal in strength, organized in one United States
field army and one British-Canadian field army. Gradually,
as the campaign developed and the beachhead expanded,
American ground forces would be increased in proportion
to the national manpower resources of the United States.
It was estimated that during the height of the campaign
the United States would be able to provide close to 100
divisions, which would be
organized in several armies
under the command of a United States army group head-
quarters. This army group would conduct military operations
on the right flank of 21 Army Group, comprising the British-
Canadian armies.
Need for an American Army Group Headquarters
The organization in Great Britain of a United States army
group headquarters became pressing when COSSAC
was
nearing completion of its strategic "Overlord" plan, early in
the summer of 1943, and the time had arrived for planning
on the lower tactical levels for specific ground force units.
It had also become evident that there existed a need for a
sister organization to 21 Army Group to plan for American
