and construction of them began at once, though some of the
units were lost in the heavy seas of the English Channel as
they were towed across from England.32
After a week of ceaseless fighting, the Allies had success-
fully established a beachhead in France. Although slowed
down in their inland drive by natural factors and stubborn
enemy resistance in hedgerow country particularly suitable
the advance continued inland, except for the
necessary regroupings to meet the contingencies of the battle.
The initiative was in Allied hands throughout the battle for
the beachhead. The invasion of France had succeeded. The
land armies, a great deal of whose success was due to the
information furnished and the support rendered by the Allied
tactical air forces the Ninth United States Air Force and
the British 2d Tactical Air Force —now began to resume the
battle to widen the beachhead.

THE BEACHHEAD WIDENED
The first phase of "Overlord" merged into the second
imperceptibly. Even as infantry troops fought their way into
Carentan, on all other sectors of the front the battle main-
tained its momentum in an effort to expand the beachhead
into one wide enough and deep enough to permit the con-
centration of large forces for the development of the cam-
paign on a broad front toward Germany. As the American
V Corps advanced south on
Caumont, just north of the
Caen-Avranches highway, and the British I and XXX Corps
engaged the German armor in the area of Tilly-sur-Seulles,
the American VII Corps was
beginning operations to cut
the Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port of Cherbourg.
The Drive for Cherbourg
On the 14th of June this drive began. The 9th Infantry
and 82d Airborne Divisions attacked westward toward St.
Sauveur-le-Vicomte, entering
the town two days later. On
