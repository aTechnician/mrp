"We had never seen such a display of airpower,"
remarked an awestruck J.G. Baird of the Regina Rifles. 46 Despite this aerial havoc,

on the Canadian front received few bombs, due to the Allies' fear of their aircraft
dropping explosives on the Canadian positions.
Wich the British attacking behind 656 artillery pieces and Typhoon fire, the
British 59th and Canadian 3rd Divisions faced their old foes, the 12th SS, backed

one that went in a few hours earlier, but while the 59th Division, with its two lead
cation for doggedness and resiliency left the Highlanders expecting a struggle. They got
it. Abour 200 of the 12th SS were in shallow slit trenches. Camouflaged in the grain,
they were difficult to spot until the riflemen and machine-gunners opened up. Anti-

tacks but struggled to keep up with the
haster vehicles." With almost no way to
communicate, confusion prevailed, and
a cordinated infantry and tank attack
ender fire was no easy thing. Of course,
