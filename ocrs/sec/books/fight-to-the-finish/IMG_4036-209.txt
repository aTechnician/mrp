FIGHT TO THE FINISH
"They' keep telling us the war is almost over," wrote nineteen-year-old Donald
Tansley, who with three months at the front was considered a long-service veteran
in the Regina Rifles. "But, we ask each other, why are the buggers still firing at us?...
A new fear was beginning to take over—would we survive the remaining days or
weeks?"106 Most did, but not all. In the first week of May, from the 1st to the 5th,
with fighting almost at an end, 114 Canadians died, including 12 on May 7, the
last day of battle in Europe. 107
CHAPTER 15
VETERANS
Canadian soldiers fought until the last day of the war, May 7.
Everyone feared being killed as the end neared.
"When you've seen your friends blown to bits around you," observed one Canadian
sodier, "it makes you think that the post-war world ... better be good!"' The ghastly
mar limped towards its end in early May. Every day saw tens of thousands of com-
beans die, while Europeans held on in starvation conditions, scrambled for cover
under the fall of bombs; or fed the stoves in the death camps. When Hitler put a
blerin his brain in a Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945, to avoid capture by the
Soviet armies that were swarming through the city (a day after Mussolini was exe-
ated by Communist forces in Italy), the war was all but over for Germany.
On May 2, the German armies in Italy surrendered. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz,
an ardent Nazi who was handed the toxic leadership of the ruined Third Reich,
delayed the surrender of his beaten
armies to allow fleeing German civil-
ans aditional time to escape the venge-
fu Soviet army and reach Allied lines.
The Germans in the Netherlands,
cothern Germany, and Denmark sur-
tendered on the 5th, and negotiations
for the total surrender of Germany
come to a lose in the early hours of
May 7, with celebrations around the
wold set for the next day. The war in
Europe was over.
The war with Germany ended on May 8, 1945.
These Canadians hold a Nazi banner in victory.
