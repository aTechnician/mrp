INTRODUCTION
At Bény-sur-Mer, in France, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery
contains 2,048 gravestones. All but five are Canadians. The cemetery is at the top of
a gentle rising hill with a view of Juno Beach, where the Canadians came ashore
on June 6, 1944. Among the immaculate green Normandy lawns, row upon row of
uniform, white gravestones lie throughout the tranquil space. The symmetrical lines
of graves stretch out, creating an optical illusion of sorts, as they seem to shimmer
and at times merge, to give the impression of a wall of stone. Above the sixteen sec-
tions of gravestones stands the Cross of Sacrifice, providing a focal point for the eye
even as the trees cluster in places and provide a shroud from the sounds of the out-

The fallen came from big cities like Montreal and Vancouver, as well as a host of
counties, villages, and farming communities such as Yorkton, Owen Sound, Cordova
Mines, and Arprior. The surnames on the gravestones range from Smith, Macdonald,
Roy, and Tremblay to Husak, Cohen, Radoy, and Kachor. This is Canada embodied
thousands of kilometres from home.
There are no fewer than twelve pairs of brothers at Bény-sur-Mer. Six families had

unthinkable losses still emanates like heat from the matching headstones. The Westlake
family of Toronto lost one son on June 7, and then two more boys within the week.
The official missives would have arrived one shattering blow after another. Another
family, the Wagners of Teeterville, Ontario, had a son buried at Bény-sur-Mer, another
