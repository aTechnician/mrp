and I am grateful for her ongoing support and friendship. Diane and the large team at
Penguin work tirelessly on behalf of authors. They are an inspiration. I would espe-
cially like to thank Mary Ann Blair for her professional management of the book in
production. My friend and agent, Rick Broadhead, is generous, talented, and has been
an ongoing source of support. In our sixth book together, Tara Tovell offered her usual
brilliant line and copy editing with skill, cheerfulness, and patience.
The oncologists and nurses at the Ottawa General Hospital have been unfailingly
professional and supportive in treating me over three years. Norman and Serge have
been supporters in our walks and talks, sharing wisdom and positive thoughts. The
Trent University crowd of Rachel, John, Lucy, Rick, Staci, Brien, and Gesa have been
there through thick and thin. Friends in Manor Park, throughout Ottawa,
and
around the world have provided kind words and welcome aid.
My mother, Dr. Sharon Cook, has been a rock during exceedingly difficult times.
As scholar, educator, mother, and grandmother, she remains optimistic, strong, and
relentles in reminding everyone there is a light at the end of the tunnel. My brother,
Graham, has offered continuous good humour and advice. Graham, Sam, Calla, and
Redden Shantz, as well as Jennifer Klotz, have been there for us.
Sarah has proved stronger than anyone could have imagined. The fight would not
be possible without her. She is my partner and love, and this book is as much hers as
mine. Our three delightful girls, Chloe, Emma, and Paige, bring a thousand smiles
and surprises, reminding us of the joy of youth and the promise of a future.
During the writing of this book, my father, Dr. Tetry Cook, passed away. He was
the most important figure in my life in training me as a historian. He was a good
dad. As a world-renowned archivist, he has been missed by the international com-
munity of scholars, librarians, and archivists. We miss him even more.
