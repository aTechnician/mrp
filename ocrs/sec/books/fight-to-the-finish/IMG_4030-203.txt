THE MESSY BATTLEFIELD and German resilience had slowed the Canadians in
Operation Veritable, but the Anglo-American steamroller kept advancing. The
U.S. Ninth Army to the south, twelve divisions strong, began its delayed offensive
on February 23. Resistance was light because much of the enemy reserve had been
moved north to counter Crerar's thrust. As the Americans made rapid inroads
towards the Rhine, the next four days saw the Canadians manoeuvre forward, wipe
out strongpoints, and prepare for a renewed offensive. On February 26, Crerar
Launched Operation Blockbuster against enemy units in the Hochwald forest, with
the goal of eventually reaching Xanten, which lay on the Rhine. It would be one of
the most costly Canadian campaigns of the entire war.
With the Americans advancing behind the Germans in late February, Montgomery
might have called off Blockbuster, unless the Ninth Army planned to turn back and be
heavil for the Anglo-Canadian hammer—which they showed no intention of doing
as the drove to the Rhine. But Montgomery was aching to see the Anglo-Canadian
forces do their part in the war, as they were now vastly overshadowed by the Americans
that were three times as large and finding success. Neither Crerar nor Simonds
Canadian infantrymen, worn and weary, slog through the mud in the final months of the war.
The enemy was beaten but refused to cumenden and the war continued on with no end in sight
