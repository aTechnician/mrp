historian Captain W.E.C. Harrison, while driving behind the lines, found the
"noise so appalling" that he was forced to steer his jeep with his elbows, with both
hands covering his ears.?' An hour later, at 6 A.M., the creeping barrage was
unleashed, and the front-line infantry formations, aided by two British tank regi-
ments, went into the dust-shrouded abyss.
The torn and twisted front between the Forme d'Aquino waterway (which formed
the boundary with the 78th Division on the right) and Pontecorvo, revealed the full
power of the gunners. During the previous three days, since the 20th, each Canadian
25-pounder artillery gun had fired around 725 shells, with medium and heavier guns
also adding to the bombardment. An aggressive counter-battery bombardment by
melled another 46 on the 23rd, so that when the infantry and tanks went forward
at zero hour, it took more than two hours before the rearward German guns
fired their first shot in retaliation.73 The Desert Air Force also contributed to the
maelstrom. Squadrons from 239 Wing
VAAK
reacted to calls from forward infantry
and RCAF observers— employing the
"Rover David" system, whereby planes
circling the battlefield were contacted
on wireless to hit targets-harassed a
strongpoint at Pontecorvo in the south-
eastern edge of the town.?4
Amid the destruction, the enemy
held on in his concrete and steel-
reinforced
positions that were largely
impervious to shells. The Canadian
advancing infantry were caught in the
crossfire of bullets, shells, and mortars
from these units, even as the German
guns further to the rear were silenced.
Explosive blasts ruptured internal organs
or rent the air with shell fragments.
