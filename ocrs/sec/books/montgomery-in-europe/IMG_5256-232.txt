Montgomery in Europe 1943-1945
I would say that the right flank of 12 Army Group should
be given a very direct order to halt and if this order is not
obeyed we shall get into greater difficulties.
The nett result of the matter is that if you want to get the
RUHR you will have to put every single thing into the left
hook and stop everything else. It is my opinion that if this is
not done then you will NOT get the RUHR.
Your very great friend, MONTY?

Europe' are
attached as Appendix 'A'.
I sent this to Bedel Smith on 10 October.

He did not agree with my views.

'Dear Ike,
I have received your letter of 13 October.
You will hear no more on the subject of command
from me. I have given you my views and you have given
me your answer.
That ends the matter and I and all of us here will weigh
in one hundred per cent to do what you want.
Your very devoted and loyal subordinate MONTY?

'Dear Monty,
Thank you for you very fine message?
B.L.M.12
On 3 May 1945, as soon as he had finished speaking to the
German delegation, Montgomery telephoned Simpson at the
War Office. The latter immediately dictated this succinct minute
of a historic call, and circulated it to the Prime Minister, the
CIGS, and the Secretary of State for War.
CIGS
1. Field-Marshal Montgomery has just telephoned to me
(4.30 p.m.) to let me know of his discussions this morning
with certain German representatives.
He has reported the
whole affair officially to SHAEF
from
whom
we
will
presumably hear in due course, but he thought you would like
private information of what took place.
2. A German delegation arrived at his Headquarters this
morning and consisted of the following:
General-Admiral von Friedenberg, who is on the staff of
Field-Marshal Keitel.
General Kinsel, Chief of Staff to Field-Marshal Busch.
