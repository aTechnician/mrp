Montgomery in Europe 1943-1945
although 5th Recce were to send patrols forward to investigate
the bridges and try to reach Cosenza to report on the airfields. 31
On the same day the Dorsets reported Nicastro clear of
Germans, and on the 12th patrols from Sth Recce reached
Amantea without meeting any enemy. On 13 September patrols
from the same unit were in Cosenza - so peaceful were the
conditions that one patrol had gone by train. The records now
available show that Montgomery simply failed to tell his
subordinate commanders to push on quickly. As the Eighth
Army War Diaries reveal: 9 September, 'Army Commander
intends pause a few days at neck to pull up tail of army. Fifth
Division will hold Catanzaro-Tierno? On 12 September the XIII
Corps Commander,
General Dempsey, had 'not yet decided
future intentions, but possibly Fifth Division would advance up
the coast? Yet on 8 September Monty had signalled Alexander:
'after three days'
fighting my line is Delianouva-Bovalina
Marina which represents nearly one thousand square miles of
Italy. Inform Winston this is my present to him.32 This was
ridiculous bombast unworthy of Montgomery, because apart
from the engagement at Pizzo there had been almost no
opposition.

Alexander
dated 9 September typified
Montgomery's attitude: My Divisions are now strung out, have
fought and marched 100 miles in seven days, are tired and must
be rested ... two days rest with intensive recce Cotrone Rossano
Belvedere Strezzano. 33
Alexander was not pleased. He knew
some of Montgomery's infantry had advanced on foot, but even
by 6 September 5,000 vehicles had crossed by ferry from
Messina to the mainland and many were available to transport
troops by road.
General Sir Frank Simpson told me:
Whenever I discussed Messina to Salerno with Monty I got
the impression that he thought the whole Italian operation
was badly planned and irresponsible, and that the Salerno
landings could never have been a success, in which he was
right because the casualties were unacceptable. He also had
