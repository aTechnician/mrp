campaign shed its early hopes of brilliant success. Alexander
erred greatly in endorsing Montgomery's decision to use Route
124, and the Germans at Messina had time to evacuate their
troops and equipment across the Straits to Italy. Correctly Maj-
Gen Hubert Essame wrote: 'Monty was too strong a personality
for Alexander, and only one man, Alanbrooke, could ever
control him.''1 Alas, in Sicily Alanbrooke was not at hand.
Eisenhower and Alexander had made no master plan for the
two armies,
preferring to leave it flexible. They failed to
understand what a hideous omission this was, for Montgomery
was temperamentally incapable of consulting with Patton to
construct such a plan. As a result of the hard fighting on each
side of Etna Eighth Army suffered nearly 12,000 casualties,
against the Americans'
7,500.
Belchem,
Montgomery's BGS in Sicily and Italy, wrote:'.... if Monty and
Patton had made a co-ordinated drive around Etna to Messina
they would have got there more quickly with less loss of life.'12
Here Belchem
is
deliberately
contradicting
his former
commander, for in defence of his decision to put XXX Corps on
Route 124 Montgomery himself had written: '... to persist in the
advance to Catania would have meant very heavy casualties ...
the object could be achieved with less loss of life by operating on
the Adrano axis [to the west] with the added advantage that on
that flank we
would be in close touch
with our American
Allies.' 13 This excuse does not hold water, since Patton was only
too ready to fill XXX Corp's role on the west slopes of Etna. If
Montgomery had kept all his armour and strength on the east
coast while Patton made the left hook, the result would have
been much happier for the Allies, and in all probability the
Germans would not have succeeded in evacuating their troops
so successfully from Messina.
Not only did Montgomery upset Patton and the Americans,
he also provoked Lt-Gen A.G.L. McNaughton, GOC Canadian
Army Overseas, who wanted to visit the Canadian Division in
Sicily commanded by Maj-Gen Guy Simonds.
Montgomery
rudely forbade him to come and said he would be arrested if he
landed. McNaughton
was
furious, as was the Canadian
Government. Alexander backed Montgomery up completely,
saying that because of the shortage of transport the decision was
justified. McNaughton complained bitterly to Eisenhower who,
concerned, took the matter up with Alexander during a bathe in
