Normandy Assault
Montgomery spent D-plus-1 at sea. The British and American
assault on the beaches had been successful, despite the rough
sea and, in places, strong resistance. The airborne divisions had
accomplished their main task; the massive air superiority and
the bombardment by naval guns had softened up the opposition
and the armies had taken full advantage of this. German
reaction
was slow, because Hitler was still duped by the
deception plan and believed the main assault would come later
in the Pas de Calais. As a result no reinforcements were rushed
from the German Fifteenth Army Group, based on the Calais
coast to Eighth Army Group fighting desperately in Normandy.
Nor would Hitler allow von Rundstedt to throw his powerful
Panzer reserves into these early battles.

Madame de Vigneral who,
with her family, was living at
Colombières-sur Seuilles, three kilometres from Sword Beach,
wrote in her
diary that by
1300 on D-Day the Germans
defending her village were running away, and that the cooks had
told her that they would kill their commanding officer when the
invasion started. Apparently they did so, for by 1330 the car in
which the commanding officer had driven away at dawn, and in
which he had died, was brought back by a Canadian to her
house when she was opening
bottles of champagne.
In the
orchard. her father found sixty rifles belonging to Germans who
had run away without fighting.? It took the Canadians until 1200
to cover the three kilometres from Sword beach.
John Henderson told me that at 0530 on the morning of D-
plus-1 Montgomery woke him up in his cabin on the destroyer
and said: 'You had better come on deck. The captain has just
told me that he is outside the channel which has been kept clear
of mines.' So Henderson and his chief stood looking over the
de for mines until, at 0630, they reached Bradley's ship, the
USS Augusta, off the French coast; Montgomery took it as a
great joke.
He now went on board the Augusta and asked
Bradley to make every
effort to link up the two American
hes. Utah and Omaha. Shortly after Montgomery had left
