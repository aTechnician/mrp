Montgomery in Europe 1943-1945
Hodges's front - he also ordered XXX Corps to station
divisions behind the Americans in case they collapsed.
Montgomery then asked Hodges who he considered to be the
most
aggressive general in First Army, and the American
singled out Maj-Gen Lawton Collins, whose US VIII Corps had
captured Cherbourg and had been spectacularly successful in
the St Lô break-out. Now two of Collins's divisions, together
with British 51st (Highland) Division, were held as strategic
reserve for US Ninth Army, with orders to prepare for a
counter-attack as soon as Montgomery was ready.
On the night of the 20th Montgomery sent this tale of woe to
Brooke:
Neither Army Commander had seen Bradley or any of 15
Army Group staff since the battle began ... no reserves
behind front ... morale very low. They seemed delighted to
have someone to give them firm orders ... All bridges over
the Meuse from south east of Liege to north east of Givet are
now held by British garrisons ...* I have every hope that the
situation
can be put right now that we have a properly
organised set up for command and proper supervision and
control can be kept over the battle. It will take a day or two to
get the American front reorganised and we may have a few
more shocks ... there was literally no control or grip of any
* 3rd Royal Tank Regiment from 29 Armoured Brigade took over
responsibility for the Meuse bridges at Namur, Givet and Dinant. When the
23rd Hussars arrived at Givet they found American reinforcement troops
queueing for the cinema, and these told the British, quite incorrectly: 'It is
OK. George Patton is coming': 3rd RTR crossed the Meuse on Christmas
Eve, and met a battle group from 2nd Panzer Division. The British force
knocked out several Panthers, and on Christmas morning tanks from US 2nd
Armoured Division, part of Collins's corps, appeared from the north across
3rd RTR's front. 2nd Panzer had reached the furthest limit of the German
advance, but by now it was out of petrol, its supply column having been
devastated from the air as it approached on 23 December. The Meuse was
never crossed, and US 2nd Armoured knocked out the 2nd Panzer battle
group at Celles on Boxing Day. In a café at Celles crossroads, four miles
from the Meuse bridge at Dinant, is an inscription in French, Flemish and
English: 'The Rundstedt offensive (Battle of the Bulge) was stopped here on
24 December 1944'. On 5 January Montgomery sent a cocky signal to the
CIGS after examination of the Celles battlefield had revealed eighty-eight
German tanks destroyed, and this tangible evidence of success may have
January.
contributed to his very optimistic mood at his famous press conference on 7
