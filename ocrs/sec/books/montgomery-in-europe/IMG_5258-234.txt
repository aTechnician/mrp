2. Vigneral Diary, Imperial War Museum, Lambeth Road, London. At
0200 on 6 June Madame de Vigneral took her children and servants to a
trench in the garden, and she returned to the house at 0930 to bring out
coffee and put the lunch on the stove. At 1200, when she brought the food
out on a tray, German soldiers were in one hedge of her garden and
Canadians in another. At 1315 she went back to get more coffee, and saw
German soldiers running away
doubled up and, soon afterwards,
Allied
soldiers lying flat on the ground. Sniping by Germans left behind went on for
many days, however. There were tears and laughter as the Canadians gave
chocolates to the children, and as soon as an officer had searched the house
for booby traps Madame de Vigneral opened the champagne she had kept
hidden from the Germans. But the Canadians became annoyed because she
could not understand their French, and unfortunately a certain amount of
pillaging took place on the pretence of looking for enemy soldiers hiding out
in empty houses; Madame de Vigneral saw furniture loaded on to lorries, and
even her sewing-machine was taken.
Montgomery issued strong orders
against looting, and on 9 July Madame de Vigneral was taken to the Town
Mayor's office in
Bayeux,
where
she identified and recovered almost
everything that had been stolen from her.
