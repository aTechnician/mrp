Important Eisenhower and Montgomery Documents
While Eisenhower was in Washington in January
1944,
Montgomery was exerting pressure for 'Anvil' (the invasion of
the South of France) to be abandoned. These signals to Bedell
Smith and Montgomery in London show that the Supreme

invasion) should be strengthened at the expense of 'Anvil', but
that he obstinately refused to give up that invasion altogether. In
the event, 'Anvil' did not draw a single German division away
from the Normandy front, but Eisenhower always claimed that
the port of Marseilles, liberated on 28 August, was an important
help in supplying his eastern armies.
January 5, 1944
From Commander in Chief to General Smith for his eyes
only.
Just as I am departing for a short journey, your W-9389 has
reached me. I have agreed
to the turnover of Allied
Mediterranean Command as of January 8, and my opinions
as to further operations there are advisory only. I agree that
OVERLORD must be more broadly based, but I do not
agree that a threat of ANVIL will be as effective as the
operation itself. The right answer consists, I believe,
in
starting now to gather up and recondition all landing craft so
as to produce the maximum number in May. This would
mean abandonment of SHINGLE [the Anzio landings,

January
19441,
but
entirely
aside
from
OVER
LORD-ANVIL considerations, that operation is open to

grave objections under
present conditions. Moreover we
must resort to use of all types of unarmored craft for use of
everything except assaulting waves,
both in OVERLORD
and ANVIL. We must insist on finding them now and
planning carefully for their maximum use. I agree that some
redistribution
of
armored

craft
in
favor
of
OVERLORD as against ANVIL may be necessary, but in
both operations we must develop the maximum in expedient

Only
in
event
that
OVERLORD
cannot

be
broadened
without
abandonment of ANVIL would I consider making such a
recommendation to the Combined Chiefs. I am passing your
radio to OPD for examination during my absence from city
with the special request that everyone turn on the heat in
finding
craft to support
armored landing craft in both
operations. Please let me know promptly of developments at
your conference on January 8. Your recommendations of
Morgan as Deputy Chief of Staff and Whiteley as G-2 are
acceptable to me.'
January 13, 1944
To Theater Commander for his eyes only for Montgomery
from Eisenhower.
I will go into the matters brought up by your W-9418,
January 10 on my arrival which will be very soon. I have
been discussing them intensively with the Staff here. The
following considerations appear pertinent. The desirability of
strengthening OVERLORD is universally accepted. However
we must not lose sight of the advantages to OVERLORD
which ANVIL brings. The fact that ANVIL presents the only
opportunity
for
use of the large
land forces
in the
Mediterranean to aid OVERLORD directly is important.
This consideration is particularly applicable in the period
from 10 to 15 days after launching the attack. Furthermore
there are certain strong considerations not purely military
which have been brought to my attention here and which
must be weighed. My own conviction is that OVERLORD
should be strengthened to the maximum possible but the
