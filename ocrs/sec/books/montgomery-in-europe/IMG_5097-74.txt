Near-Failure and
The Break-Out
Montgomery and Bradley had scheduled the main all-out attack
by the Americans in the west as part of the "Goodwood'
offensive. In preparation, St Lô had been taken by Bradley's US
First Army, after bloody fighting, by 18 July, and the major
attack, 'Cobra', was due to start on 20 July. The American push
to take St Lô had begun on 3 July, and other gains had been
made all along the front.
Unfortunately for Montgomery, 'Cobra' had to be postponed
because of the bad weather which had brought 'Goodwood' to a
close, since a vital part of the plan was for the attack to be
preceded by the same mass carpet bombing as for 'Goodwood'
three days previously, and using the same aircraft.
Leigh-
Mallory, in charge of the Allied tactical bombing at SHAEF,
crossed to Normandy alarmed by the bad weather forecast.
"Cobra' was immediately rescheduled for 1300 on 24 July, but
visibility was again hopeless on that day. 'Cobra' was postponed
until 0938 on 25 July.
This delay was

was a temporary
stalemate. Resentment
against him boiled over. Maliciously, Tedder kept underlining to
Eisenhower that Montgomery had not pressed the 'Goodwood'
attack at the crucial moment, and had prevented his armour
from pushing on; he wrote a letter to the Supreme Commander
saying that Montgomery 'had no intention of making this
operation the decisive one which you so clearly intended."'
Eisenhower was himself angry with his army commander, for he
felt that Montgomery had led him up the garden path with his

Montgomery had made a big mistake in creating,
before the
event, a scenario for one of the great victories of modern times.
Eisenhower had been fussed by the visit to
London, on 18
July, of Henry Stimson,
the US Secretary of War. Stimson had
emphasised that the American press was making much of the
of the fighting. Stimson advised Eisenhower to set up his HQ in
