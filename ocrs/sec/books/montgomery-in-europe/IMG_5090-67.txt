3. The enemy
There are a lot of enemy divisions in the area SE of
CAEN:
21 PZ
1 SS
272
16 GAF
12 SS
Another one is coming and will be here this week-end.
4. Operations of 12 Corps and Cdn Corps - 16 & 17 July
Advantage must be taken of these to make the Germans
think we are going to break out across the ORNE between
CAEN and AMAYE.
5. Initial Operations 8 Corps
The three armoured divisions will be required to dominate
the
area
BOURGUEBUS-VIMONT-BRETTEVILLE,
and to fight and destroy the enemy.
But armoured cars should push far to the south towards
FALAISE, and spread alarm and despondency, and
discover 'the form'.
6. Canadian Corps
While para 5 is going on, the Canadians must capture
VAUCELLES, get through communication, and establish
themselves in a very firm bridgehead on the general line
FLEURY-CORMELLES-MONDEVILLE.
7. Later Operations 8 Corps
When 6 is done, then 8 Corps can 'crack about' as the
situation demands.
But not before 6 is done.
8. To sum up for 8 Corps
Para 5.
Para 7.
9. Finally
Para 6 is vital.

The tone of these instructions is cautious, although they
mention armoured cars pushing far to the south towards Falaise
creating
alarm and
despondency', and
VIlI Corps armour
'cracking about'. Montgomery stressed that it was vital that the
Canadians should be successful in capturing Caen and pushing
south down the Orne to Fleury, and that no armoured 'crack
about' could take place otherwise; this heavy qualification is
typical.
Another
clue to Montgomery's real
intentions
during
"Goodwood' lies in a letter to Simpson dated 14 July and
delivered personally by Lt-Col
Christopher Dawnay
Montgomery's Tac HQ
staff. Dawnay told Simpson
that
Montgomery's real objective for 'Goodwood' was 'to muck up
and write off as many enemy troops as possible', and that if the
drive to the Bourguebus Ridge was successful he would move
west to surround and eliminate the enemy in the Villers Bocage-
Evrecy area; 'Simultaneously he hoped the Americans would
eliminate the Germans in the triangle
Lessay-Coutances.'
Simpson believes that Montgomery had no intention of rushing
madly east or south, and his view is that 'Goodwood' was
manly intended to help simultaneous American attacks in the
The late Maj-Gen Belchem co-operated with Montgomery in
the writing of the latter's book Normandy to the Baltic. About
'Goodwood' Montgomery wrote: 'The armoured divisions were
to dominate the
area Hubert
Folie-Verrieres,
Vimont,
and
Garcelles Secqueville,
places which are all north of Bourguebus.
When, however, Belchem suggested that they should print the
actual order to Dempsey and O'Connor, with its instruction to
'dominate Bourguebus, Montgomery refused. Clearly after the
war
he
wanted to play
down his expectations from
the
'Goodwood' attack.
One of his chief difficulties with 'Goodwood' was that in order
to persuade the air marshals to give him another dose of carpet
bombing, he had to infer that this was an all-out attack leading
to a break-out.
The air commanders had told him that they
would not take their aircraft off the strategic targets in Germany
for a limited attack; Montgomery, therefore, had to bluff that he
would break the German front. As a result he was criticised.
On 14 July he wrote to Brooke: 'The time has come for a real
showdown ... to loose a corps of Armoured Divisions into the
