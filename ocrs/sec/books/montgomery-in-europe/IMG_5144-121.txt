jolly day for these

about the strength of the Germans. See what you can do to
stop him?'
As Monty's Head of Intelligence it was my job to tell him
all about the enemy. I could always contradict Monty if I said
'Sir' at the end of the sentence. Graham and Belchem were both
Regular soldiers and they had to think of their careers in
peace-time after the war when Monty was sure to be all-
powerful. As temporary soldiers this
was not a factor with
Oliver Poole or myself. We could tell Monty he was wrong.
At first our knowledge of the enemy at Arnhem was flimsy,
but it built up during the week. I forecast the enemy's strength
at Arnhem reasonably accurately, but 10th and 9th
SS
Panzer had
survived [the defeat in Normandy] and had
refitted, so they were stronger than I had expected, and
General Student with his Para Corps also reacted more
quickly than I had forecast. Student was a very intelligent
reptile.
Wing-Commander Asher Lee, an expert in reading Ultra
signals, was lent by the Air Ministry to Allied Airborne Army
HQ as Air Intelligence Officer for the duration of 'Market-
Garden'. He became so concerned at the Ultra evidence of a
strong Panzer presence in the Arnhem area that he began to
'badger' Brereton, who in turn told him to pay a visit to Twenty-
First Army Group in Brussels. Asher Lee told me:
I wanted to emphasise to Monty's HQ the importance of
having enough anti-tank weapons. From Ultra signals it was
impossible to estimate the number of German tanks there. I
had a long interview at 21 Army Group HQ but I did not see
a very high-ranking officer. Brereton himself at my HQ was
remote from the detailed planning and I had no contact with
General Browning at Corps. Ist Allied Airborne Army HQ
had been hastily slammed together.
I was good friends with Colonel Tony Tasker at Corps HQ
who had a parallel job to mine, but he never showed me any
air
pics.
So
fed up was
Tasker
at
the
seventeen
postponements of operations since D-Day that he put up a
notice: 'D-Day is any day from Monday to Sunday and you
must choose your own bloody dropping zone.' Definitely at
that point airborne troops were itching to have a go. 13
