Montgomery's dismissal, and was backed by Portal. Winterbotham in The
Ultra Secret quotes a secret signal from
Tedder to Churchill saying that
Eisenhower was on the brink of asking that Montgomery should go.

Irving goes on to state that Lt-Col George
Pfann, secretary to General Patton, says that Patton vanished for a day in
mid-August. When he returned he stated that he had been trying to make
contact with a German
emissary
who did not turn up.
On 27 July 1945,
however, Field-Marshal von Kluge's son-in-law, Udo Esch, German Medical
Corps, interrogated later,
said that
von
Kluge had discussed with him
surrendering the whole of the Western Front. Esch's words were: 'He went to
the front lines but was unable to get in touch with the Allied commander?'
Blumentritt,
under
interrogation,
stated that Keitel had told him
of an
intercepted Allied signal to von
Kluge.
Other Nazis,
after the surrender,
claimed that they had heard the same story -
- but it may
well have been
spread by leading Nazis who knew that von Kluge was in touch with the
conspirators.
