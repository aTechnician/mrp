Preface
This book has been shaped by my childhood experiences, growing up in the
1950s. An earlier book on farmworkers in the early twentieth century owed
its origin to stories about the Great War told to me by ex-servicemen.! These
suggested that patriotism, in the close-knit community where I grew up, was
compatible with class consciousness and political activism. Though at that
time the Second World War seemed as far away as the Crimean War, this
conflict was the centre of most juvenile popular culture: comics, 'pictures',
toy soldiers and games of army versus Germans played on the 'rec. We all
knew what roles our parents had played in the war.
My father, Fred Mansfield (1912-2004), had a relatively quiet war. Though
a pre-war Territorial in the Engineers, an old footballing injury kept him in
the UK, as a gunner, exchanging fire spasmodically with German planes.
Army service opened horizons beyond his home town, and furnished him
with material for later soldiers' stories. He was a servant or 'batman' to his
battery commander. This excused him much 'bull' and enabled his cadging
skills to thrive.

with army issue disinfectant.) Later, he was posted to an isolated gun site
overlooking Scapa Flow, where he did odd jobs for an elderly widow who
ran a croft on
South Ronaldsay. Despite Orkney being classed as a war
zone, he brought my mother and older brother up to join him. They lived
with the widow, and my father paid the rent by working on the farm. His
mates covered for him, the officer turned a blind eye to any irregularities,
and they were rewarded with off-the-ration eggs. With a background in
the building trade, towards the end of the war, he was 'combed-out' of
his unit.
He spent months repairing bomb and shell damage in Dover,
