Soldiers as Workers
The Post Office also recruited many ex-soldiers, as they were accustomed
to the uniform and irregular hours. John Walsh served in the z2nd Foot,
following in the footsteps of his father and three uncles, who all served in
the regiment during the First Sikh War. He was discharged about 1877,
and became a Liverpool-based postman. Walsh was a founder member
of the Postmen's Federation in 18gt and remained a key activist in the
movement for union recognition until his retirement in 1914. His memory
was still being invoked during the postal strike of 1971. Later, the GPO
was keen to attract telegraphists who had trained in the Royal Enginers
and gave preference in recruitment to ex-military men. It employed 2,644
ex-servicemen by 1913.183
The spectacular mid-Victorian growth of railways in Britain offered a
unique employment opportunity for ex-soldiers. Numbers of railway workers
rose from 47,278 in 1847 to 274, 535 in 1873. Relatively well- and regularly paid,
railwaymen's developing loyalty to the railway company was fulfilled by
disciplined ex-servicemen who were used to the often dangerous work and
company owned accommodation and regarded it as a great privilege to work
on the railway. Ex-servicemen also inAuenced the structure of the industry:
"The division into three grades has deep historical roots. The early railways
were organised on a military basis, with grades replacing military ranks' By
the Edwardian period, an average of 600 jobs a year were being offered to
ex-soldiers on the Irish railways alone.184
The evolution of this highly disciplined workforce was primarily due to
safety considerations but also 'from the expectations of railway officials, many
of whom were from the army and were used to controlling large numbers of
uniformed and obedient men. In particular, after the Indian Mutiny, many
ex-EIC officers filled the salaried grades of the railway companies:
railway uniforms also had military echoes and each company had its
own, the equivalent of army regimentals. A man did not go to works,
he went on duty. His position was a post, and when he left that post'
he was relieved'. Senior grades were referred to as 'Officers? 'Absent
without leave' and charge' were used in the formality of railway industrial
relations. Early strikes became the equivalent to mutiny to the managers.
By 1889, 11,000 ex-soldiers were railwaymen which had doubled to 237724

by 193. Although only a small portion of the total workforce, their military
ethos dominated the service. 185
Foreign service
Despite the range of employment activities engaged in, many
soldiers
regarded soldiering as their primary trade. Even when, for various reasons,
they were discharged from the British army, many sought to pursue it
elsewhere. As will be discussed in Chapter 4, deserters in overseas climes
sometimes ended up taking foreign service, even when this meant opposing
the Crown. This was usually accidental and a temporary means of earning a
livelihood in an uncertain world. There were still opportunities well into the
ninetenth century for soldiers to choose to ply their central trade outside the
British army, in the service of Indian princes and in private exneditions to
South America and parts of southern Europe after 1815, or in the armies of
the Ottoman Turks until after the Crimean War. Sometimes such soldiering
in foreign service was the result of resistance to military authority or in the
support of political views. Ex-British army soldiers fought in the Italian
Risorgimento, and on both sides in the America Civil War. Four survivors of
the Charge of the Light Brigade later saw service in the Union army in the
American Civil War and one, Corporal Thomas Morley, became a veomanry
instructor on his return to the UK 186
A typical example was Kerryman Maurice Shea, who fought with the
73rd Foot at Waterloo and in Ceylon. Honourably discharged as a Corporal
in 1822, he found it difficult to keep a large family in Ireland and joined
the British Auxiliary Legion as a Quartermaster Sergeant, served in 26
engagements in the Carlist Wars in Spain and was decorated. Discharged
again in 1838, his family migrated to Canada after the Famine and he died
in 18g2, aged 97 - one of the last survivors of Waterloo. More outlandish
was John Rees (alias Jack the Fifer) from South Wales. He probably served
in the British militia and then in the army of the Texas Republic at the time
of the Alamo. Returning to Wales and involved in political radicalism, he
helped lead the disastrous Chartist attack on Newport in 1839, fled to the
USA and fought as a Texas Ranger in the Mexican-American War of 1846.
After taking part in the 1849 Gold Rush, he died in California in 1893.187
