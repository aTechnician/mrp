Soldiers as Workers
universally accepted by rural historians as often concealing a highly skilled
workforce in the nineteenth-century countryside. +
Edward Coss has compiled a database of 7,300 soldiers, most of whom
served in the Peninsular War, which identified over 360 different trades
amongst their pre-enlistment employment. He argues convincingly that
the rank and file of army in the mass mobilisation of the Napoleonic Wars
were not "the very scum of the earth", but represented a cross section of
the new working class'. John Cookson's study of post-1815 Scottish military
pensioners describes the settled working man rather than the archetypal
soldier thrown adrift on society on discharge from the army. In a careful
analysis of the occupations of the mid-Victorian 16th Lancers, John Rumsby
suggests that cavalry regiments attracted more tradesmen as recruits - men
used to making their own decisions and using their own initiative - than did
infantry regiments. He concludes that 94.5 per cent of cavalry other ranks
were literate, compared with a civilian rate of 66 per cent, and concludes
that its rank and file were drawn disproportionately from the literate artisan
classes'5
Others have identified significant regional variations in recruitment
patterns, and the sudden decline of some trades in the face of industrialisation
and specialisation, which could lead to mass recruitment of those whose
livelihood was displaced. Neil Garnham has correlated the late-eighteenth-
century collapse of the Irish linen trade with the large numbers of Ulster
army recruits. Individual testimonies also illustrate the economic impact
of the French Wars for some individuals. Thomas Jackson of Walsall was
employed by his father, a manufacturer of shoe buckles: 'But owing to the
long protracted war with several of those countries, our trade became nearly
lost ... Destructive, ruinous war was again proclaimed against France in
May 1803. Trade now quite stagnated, and nothing but starvation was looked
for by the working classes! Jackson joined the militia in desperation, which
took him into the Guards. The loss of a leg in battle was compensated for
with the wooden one: 'A mighty poor recompense ... I might never have
been a military man but through the adversity of the times in those days
when I entered the militia. By the end of the century, modern industrial

disputes could also aid recruiting, as reported by one officer in 1904: 'But we
must remember that strikes and things of that kind give us a lot of recruits;
sometimes a place is shut up and therefore it is through no fault of their own
that men are out of work. We all know that strikes do us a lot of good?6
Studies of soldiers' increasing literacy, though with slightly varying
statistics, tend to support the view that they were not 'scum. While in 1813
only 66 men of the Armagh Militia were literate, this is demonstrative of the
state of education amongst the rural poor in Ireland. By 1873 (even before the
Cardwell reforms bringing in shorter service took full effect), only 6 per cent
of regular soldiers could not read and write (down from 20 per cent in 1858)
and over 32 per cent were said to have a 'superior education'. Over half of the
55th Foot in India in the i85os subscribed to the regimental library. In 1899,
89.9 per cent of army recruits could read and write, a tribute to compulsory
elementary education in the new Board Schools. Between 1874 and 1880, 6r
per cent of recruits were listed as unskilled labourers, but this occupational
group included servants (who could possess expertise) and agricultural
labourers (who were often very skilled at farm work)?
Throughout the nineteenth century, contemporary military commentators
asserted that rankers were working class and not scum. Though William
Cobbett's view was coloured by his radical politics, he knew about the army,
having worked his way up from a ploughboy recruit to Regimental Sergeant
Major (RSM) in the 178os: 'In short, journeymen and labourers, when they
become soldiers, are still the same men; they have the same hearts and minds
that they have before, only with a great deal of additional intelligence and
acuteness. Experienced recruiting Sergeant Griffiths reflected the same
view, that enlistment was the result of unavoidable unemployment, in 1867:
'The great mass of recruits are men doubtless in difficulties who only enter
Her Majesty's service because at the moment they have no other means of
existence, and they view the step as a desperate remedy for their case?
Charles Grey, serving in the Buffs in the 188os, complained of '[Soldiers]
stigmatised as drunken and illiterate sots. We were nothing of the sort but
just ordinary young men, preponderatingly [sic] of the working classes and of
the same education and habits? This was still echoed at the end of the century
