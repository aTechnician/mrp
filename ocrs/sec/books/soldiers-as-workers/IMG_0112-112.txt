Soldiers as Workers
One Hanoverian officer serving with the British in Spain in 1807, gave an
outsider's verdict: 'I incline more and more to the conviction that excessive
drinking among the English soldiers and sailors is the result of despair
proceeding from the situation in which they are subjected to a discipline
indisputably the most severe to be found in any European army?124
Drunken violence
suggested that officers and NCOs let it die down naturally overnight and
dealt with it in the morning rather than interfere. 'Officers should avoid
altercations with drunken soldiers; a reply might be made which could not be
overlooked, and would not have been given under other circumstances and
*The Lieutenant Colonel positively forbids any NICOs to have any altercation
with a drunken soldier; a file of the Guard should be called to take him to
the Guard House, or if possible, his own comrades should be called upon
to perform this duty. 125
were double those of the surrounding Manchester slums. Drinking was
worse still as remote and boring imperial garrisons became the norm for
the Victorian army. Ration beer became two pints of wine daily in the
Mediterranean and up to a pint of rum in the West Indies, or arrack in
India, easily supplemented by canteens open six hours a day or illegal
'country lycour. In India, Colour Sergeant David Haslock of the 41st Foot,
an ex-Kidderminster carpet maker, tells us, 'At seven o'clock each morning
and four o'clock in the afternoon each soldier is served out with a dram of
Arrack, about one fifth of a pine. Huge quantities were consumed. In India
during 1833, 710 men of the 26th Foot, the Cameronians - a regiment with
a strong Calvinist tradition - drank 5,320 gallons of arrack, 209 gallons of
brandy, 249 gallons of gin and 207 hogsheads (i.e., 11,178 gallons) of beer.
Such hard drinking in extreme climates caused unhealthy soldiers, but
reform took decades.126
The horrendous environment and infections in the Caribbean campaigns of
the 1790s were compounded by drinking rum in 'a degree of desperation that
is scarcely credible wrote one surgeon. Consumption of moonshine or new
rum was even thought to counteract sickness, leading to dreadful downward

spirals of health which amounted to alcoholism. The two battalions of the
68th Foot lost 1,588 of its men out of a strength of 2,330.127
In the Peninsular War dangerous retreats before the French in bad
weather resulted in binge drinking of looted wine which incapacitated huge
numbers of soldiers. In the retreat from Burgos in i812, 'it is said that twelve
thousand men were seen at one time in a state of helpless inebriety. Sergeant
Wheeler of the gist Foot wrote:
It is impossible for any army to have given themselves up to more
dissipation and everything that is as bad as did our army. The conduct of
some men would have disgraced savages, drunkenness had prevailed to
such a frightful extent that I have often wondered how it was that a great
part of our army was not cut off.
Far from controlling such behaviour, the bard drinking culture was oftee
shared by officers. After Waterloo, only one officer of the z/goth was fit to
command a route march in Ireland, whilst the rest travelled on with their
hangovers in coaches. Particularly in hot foreign stations officers could
descend into alcoholism.128
By the 1840s, some Colonels attempted to control drinking outside the strict
hours of the canteens. This proved almost impossible as liquor was available
outside and could be smuggled into barracks. John Pearman described dodges
such as bladders concealed down trousers and imitation babies carried into
canteens by wives, into which liquor could be poured for later after-hours
sale. Containment was encouraged and often heavy drinking sessions were
allowed to run their course without official interference. Military crime
caused by drink peaked in 1868, with 13.7 per cent of British soldiers being
court-martialled, with 25,612 convictions out of a total strength of 186,508.
The late-Victorian period saw a marked decline in drinking, dropping to
only 50 convictions per 1,000 soldiers per year by the Edwardian period, as
the Cardwell system of short-term soldiering took effect, 129
Running a public house seems to have
been the
epitome of many
ex-rankers' post-army careers. This is not surprising given the army culture
of drinking and wartime opportunities for prize money and looting. Pub
names often reveal an association with ex-soldiers of the past. The Marquis
of Granby was named after a valiant and paternalistic cavalry commander of
