Soldiers as Workers
and flexibility in employment than the line, in the words of one recruiting
poster of 1778:
every possible indulgence, consistent with their duty will be given to the
private men; they will be allowed to work for themselves during hay time
and harvest (and at all other times, when they are quartered in places
where work is to be had, to a great a degree as circumstances will permit),
so that the men who enlist in these regiments do not become soldiers in
the common sense of the word. 15
The rank and file for all types of regular military service were volunteers,
who in theory joined for life, in exchange for a substantial enlistment bounty.
In practice, though, hard service and the disbandment of regiments meant
that most soldiers were discharged or became unfit before 50, making it a
young man's trade. To try and stimulate recruitment during the pressing
needs of the French Wars, more attractive, short-term service,
for seven
years, was introduced briefly in 1806, together with pensions. The cost of this
became a drain to post-1815 governments and both were abandoned with the
peace. Short service was revived again in 1847, with ten years in the infantry
and twelve in the cavalry, though not the pensions, which were reserved for
disabled soldiers. The Cardwell reforms of the t87os reduced the length of
service again, usually to six years, followed by six years in a newly created
reserve, part of the strengthened regimental system with a settled depot in
its county town. 16
The proportions of British nationalities in the army changed through
the nineteenth century. Refugees from rebellion and overpopulation in
Ireland and Scotland found a home in the forces. In 1830, there was still
a high proportion of Irish (42.2 per cent) and Scots (13.6 per cent) even in
some nominally 'English' regiments. After the 1846 famine, Irish migration
focused on the USA and with increasing political aspirations the percentage
of Irish soldiers declined to 27.9 per cent in 1870 and 15.6 per cent in 1888
and then g.t per cent in 1912, roughly the same as the Irish population in the
UK. Scots numbers were more static, with 9.3 per cent in 1868 and 7.7 per
cent in 1879, less than its proportion of the population. The many Highland
regiments only maintained their numbers with Scottish lowland and urban
recruits and even Englishmen. The number of Welshmen in the army
was consistently low through time. Overall, the army became increasingly
anglicised, up to 80 per cent by 1898. In addition, there was an overall decline

the most fruitful recruiting grounds.17
Militia
The county militia were descended from English medieval levies and, as
trained bands, had taken part in the Civil War, the Monmouth Rebellion
and the Glorious Revolution. They saw themselves as the 'ancient consti-
tutional force' in opposition to regal power, with its potentially mercenary
standing armies. They were based firmly in their counties under the control
of rural elites and were mainly Whig in sympathy.
Though reorganised
and mobilised in 1757 for the Seven Years War, the county militia was in
effect a private army, though formed entirely of infantry. It was controlled
by the Home Office rather than the War Office and organised by the
Lords Lieutenant. These exercised considerable patronage and appointed its
officers, who, with compulsorily property qualifications, were all from the
county elites. Regular officers looked down on the home-based militia, who
had never fired a shot in anger. Their officers were paid less, and were always
junior in status to regulars, and there was a long tradition of antipathy and
duels or even fights between them.18
As will be examined in Chapter 2, below, militia rank and file were
mainly local to their counties and raised by ballot. They were almost entirely
working class since the poor who drew a bad number could not afford to
pay for a substitute, which was allowed under the system. This also spared
gentlemen serving in its ranks with the non-genteel.
The militia were
mobilised for full-time service in 1793 and again in 1803 for the duration
of the war, with contracts that specified home service only. The system
was extended to Scotland in 1797, resulting in widespread protests. Despite
this, a host amounting to 129 regiments - some up to 1,000 strong - were
in arms by 1810. As men died from disease, deserted or volunteered for
regular regiments, numbers were kept up through further ballots, some quite
substantial - as when 276 of the Shropshire Militia volunteered for the line
in 1809. During the French Wars, militia regiments, as a matter of policy,
were stationed away from their home counties in case they had to act against
local protesters. In particular, the Luddite revolt in the North Midlands in
