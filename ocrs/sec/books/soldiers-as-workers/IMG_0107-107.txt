Soldiers as Workers
The ideological change that came with the French Revolution brought
in a new morality for soldiers based on nationhood. As will be discussed in
the companion volume, several liberal British officers took service with the
French. The Irish especially were valued as cadres for a potential revolution
in Ireland, though most arrived too late to play a decisive part in the 1798
rebellion. Napoleon formed the remnants of these United Irish revolu-
tionaries into an Irish Legion in 1803 and in 1809 its two battalions fought
against the British in Spain and at Walcheren in the Netherlands. In 8il,
Daniel McCarthy of the 3oth Foot, who had been captured at the battle of
Fuentes, reappeared amongst the army's pickets and claimed that he had
taken service with the French Irish Legion in order to rejoin his own lines.
Though supplemented by other foreign soldiers, and a few English who
had been bullied by the Legion's recruiting parties, its core of United Irish
officers served until disbandment in 1815. Irishmen served in other French
Imperial regiments: an Irish Cuirassier was killed at Waterloo by a trooper
of the Life Guards. The Bonapartist monarchy in Spain also recruited Irish
deserters for their own Royal irlandais regiment. 100
In the Americas during the 1790s, several white military deserters joined
the fierce escaped slave Maroon societies in the interior of Jamaica. In
the semi-piratical campaigning along the River Platte in South America
in 1806-07, some British deserters took service with the Argentine army.
This happened when a whole British army of 8,000 men surrendered after
a disastrous assault on Buenos Aires. Though released when peace was
established, many soldiers preferred to desert to the soft southern culture,
with the 7ist Foot alone losing 35 men through desertion. 101
The problem of deserters joining a foreign service was on a more serious
scale in the long-running Peninsular War. John Fisher of Berwick was
captured during the retreat to Corunna in 1808 and took French service.
In his new role three years later, he apparently survived Napoleon's retreat
from Moscow and after the peace worked as an Edinburgh detective, where
he helped arrest the bodysnatchers Burke and Hare. By early 1812, after the
stroning of Ciudad Rodrigo, Drummer Richard Bentinck of the z3rd Foot

The US army in the War of 1812 included many British deserters. At the
battle of Queenston Heights, as the invading Americans were literally hurled
off the cliffs of the Niagara River: One man was heard to cry significantly to
a group of his fellows, "Come, men: it's better to be drowned than hanged";
for there were many British renegades serving in the American army? After
the defeat of the British at the Battle of New Orleans in early 1815, the
American recruiters targeted the pariah 44th Foot, which had panicked
during the attack.
