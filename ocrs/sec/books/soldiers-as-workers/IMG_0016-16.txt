Soldiers as Workers
I8II-12 caused the Leicestershire, Rutland, Nottingham, Northamptonshire
and Warwickshire militias to be sent to Ireland and regiments from other
counties were urgently drafted in.?9
A few militia regiments volunteered to serve abroad early in 1814 to
garrison Bordeaux, but did not see active service before the fall of Napoleon,
and all regiments were stood down later that year. Though the ballot was
still retained, the militias went into suspended animation and the proposed
annual training was generally abandoned. But widespread post-war popular
politics and disturbances caused some counties to renew their training
programmes. In the Denbighshire Militia, for instance, all their men trained
for 28 days in 1820, 1827, 1825 and 183r. The county towns retained their militia
barracks with a small cadre of permanent staff, consisting mainly of sergeants
and musicians (see the section 'Pensioners, instructors and administrators,
in Chapter 3, below). The latter provided music for gentry society and the
former trained militiamen and occasionally mustered the 3i, 2or regular army
pensioners - the 'seven-year men' - left over in peacetime. The militia cadi
was also sporadically used to quell riots or enforce evictions, or act against
strikers, potential subversives or political radicals.20
In reaction to perceived renewed French imperial threats, a new Militia Act
was passed in 1852, despite political opposition. Recruitment was voluntary,
though a bounty was paid, again a valuable earner for working-class men,
though the ballot was retained in extremis. The 80,000 recruits obtained did
56 days annual training a year and the regiments in each British county
were mobilised again during the Crimean War and Indian Mutiny. Some
English militia served in Ireland, and some units volunteered for garrison
duty in Mediterranean stations. The War Office took over from the Lords
Lieutenant in 1871 as part of Cardwell reforms, when the militia became part
of the new county depots and in the 188os provided a third of all recruits to
the regular army. The militia were again embodied for the Boer War and
sent drafts to the front. As part of Haldane reforms, the militia became the
Special Reserve battalions of county regiments, retaining their local and
working-class culture until the Great War. One Edwardian MP referred to
them as an annexe to the work-house, into which boys of seventeen are to

Honourable East India Company
Since its foundation in the seventeenth century, the East India Company
(EIC), the government-backed private organisation which ran British India
until 1858, also employed its own armed forces. Though most soldiers were
black sepoys, white recruits were used from 166g, both as officers to direct
sepoys and as specific white infantry, artillery and, later, cavalry regiments
in the three Presidencies of British influence. They were dressed and trained
just like British regulars but were recruited exclusively for Indian service.
They enjoyed higher pay - and a high standard of living in India - along
with pensions on discharge. In addition, early-nineteenth-century wars gave
opportunities for batta (campaign pay), prize money and plunder, along with
more relaxed relationships between men, NCOs and officers. Discipline was
much freer and, off parade, dress was more informal: 'we keep what close
[sic] we like', according to one soldier. The drawbacks were a high mortality
rate because of disease, and lack of home leave. If they wished to remain in
India, job opportunities existed for soldiers in the EIC's growing civil and
fiscal bureaucracy, which employed 1o per cent of its white troops in 1856.
Initially, EIC recruits had roughly the same background as those of the
line, but as employment possibilities became better known, better-educated
men signed up.
file tended to be 'cockney', or men who had drifted to the capital, or Irish.
There was a high number of clerks, who had often made career decisions to
seek their fortune in India. 22
EIC officers had a lower status than other officers, and many were of lowly
origin, typically sons of tradesmen or the younger sons of impoverished
gentry, with Irish and Scots predominating. They were always outranked by
