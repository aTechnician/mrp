Soldiers as Workers
In addition to those in the Indian army, opportunities existed for NCO
trainers in other colonial corps. The re-raised West Indian regiments of
1867 each employed 18 white senior NCOs to undertake all technical and
training roles. British NCOs also trained the Egyptian army from 1882
and were entitled to the generous 'Khedival allowances. Until the Great
War, NCOs in India could be seconded as instructors - 'a well paid staff
job' - to the large private armies of the Indian princes. These forces were
tolerated in parallel to those of the Raj. Sometimes such jobs involved
actual fighting. Ex-Sergeant James Bodell of the soth Foot was out of luck
after the failure of the Victoria gold rush in Australia, Still 'a good drill;
he signed up with nearly 1,000 others (mostly ex-servicemen) as a Sergeant
Militiaman for the Maori Wars in New Zealand in 1863. Bodell considered
this contract of s. 6d. per day for privates and the 3s. 6d. for Sergeants
"not bad terms' compared with HIM service, even after extensive fighting
during his three years' service. The militiamen also got a grant of land of
so acres for privates, and 8o acres for Sergeants, which prompted Bodell's
settlement in the dominion. 188
Parade strengths
Amongst serving regiments the high number of soldiers doing other
jobs led to perennial complaints by senior officers. They claimed that the
parade strength and firing line was being leeched by increasing numbers
of non-combatant specialists. For the cishteenth-century army Houlding
formulated the 'friction of peace' theory, in which day-to-day concerns were
a distraction from war and its preparation. In 1845, Major Macready of the
3oth Foot criticised the paper strength for the regiment at Waterloo, in
which he served:
In the returns of Captain Siborne's History (recently published), the numbers
of the goth are given as is men, whereas 460 bayonets was the outside of
what marched into the field at Quatre Bras. It is not for me to say what
portion of the residue went to Guards, hospital, provost, stores or what
not, but I know near fifty effective soldiers were away from the battle as
servants and batmen ….. whereas i6o rank and file was strength when we
piled arms.
Some regimental workers were keen to join their comrades in battle. The
2/73th Foot formed a square with Macready's battalion against repeated

French cavalry charges at Waterloo and counted their Schoolmaster, Sergeant
Charles Collins, amongst the dead 189 The problem continued, as gentleman
ranker J.E. Acland described in 1873:
There is a point which I may explain here, which puzzled me very much
when I first joined, and no doubt seems curious to many, viz, why there
should be so few men on parade. Why, when a regiment has, say goo men,
there should be only 250 or 300 out on a day, when it might be expected
that everyone would appear? It is often asked, Where in the world do
the men get to?' (I can quote a case which is a purely chance one from an
old parade state' I have before me). There appears that the total strength
of 'H' Company, -th Regiment, on 7 November 1873, was 4 sergeants, 4
corporals, st men. When the officer came on parade at 1o o'clock that day
the sergeant reported, and perfectly truly, 'All present, sir' - and whom
did he sce? a sergeants, i drummer boy, 3 privates! I must remark that this
was only an ordinary drill, not a special parade, but it was still the chief
parade of the day. Where, then were the other non-commissioned officers
and 48 private men? As follows: 8 men on guard; 3 bandsmen; 4 servants oa
grooms; corporal, r private employed as tailors; pioneer; a corporal and a
private doing clerks' work; 2 men sick; 1 cook; i sergeant and 2 privates on
some regimental duty, such as canteen or quartermaster stores; 5 men on
public works, such as road making or building; 13 men on various fatigue
duties, Total, 44 privates, 2 corporals, 3 sergeants.
By 1902, this auxiliary workforce was estimated as costing the army 7,000 on
permanent employment and 10,000 on daily casual employment.190
Career progression and conclusion
Whilst many ex-soldiers ended their days in the workhouse system, many
others used their training and work experience in the ranks to forge
prosperous careers. As others have argued, we know comparatively little
about post-service careers and need more longitudinal studies, as military
service would have been only part of a man's life in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. Joining the army could be a deliberate step on a
career path. The connection between short service in the Guards and the
Metropolitan Police has already been mentioned. By the 186os, according to
the CO of the 12th Lancers, 'considerable numbers of young men, especially
