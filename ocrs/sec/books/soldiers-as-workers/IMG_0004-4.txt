Studies in Labour History
'...a series which will undoubtedly become an important force in
re-invigorating the study of Labour History? English Historical Review
Studies in Labour History provides reassessments of broad themes along
with more detailed studies arising from the latest research in the field
of labour and working-class history, both in Britain and throughout the
world. Most books are single-authored but there are also volumes of essays
focussed on key themes and issues, usually emerging from major conferences
organized by the British
Society for the Study of Labour History. The
series includes studies of labour organizations, including international ones,
where there is a need for new research or modern reassessment. It is also
its objective to extend the breadth of labour history's gaze beyond conven-
tionally organized workers, sometimes to workplace experiences in general,
sometimes to industrial relations, but also to working-class lives beyond the
immediate realm of work in households and communities.
