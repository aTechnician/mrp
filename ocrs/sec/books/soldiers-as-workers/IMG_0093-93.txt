Royal title and had to change the colour of their regimental facings on
their collars and cuffs from royal blue to yellow.24
That same year, several of the newly raised regular infantry regiments
also mutinied over their contracts. This was in response to being threatened
with drafting to other regiments bound for overseas service, potentially to
the death trap of the West Indies. These mutinies included the Londonderry
Regiment at Exeter, which was suppressed by the 25th Light Dragoons,
the 1o4th and tith Foot in Dublin and the 33rd Ulster Light Dragoons,
fencibles enlisted for home service only, when an attempt was made to
hassle them to serve abroad. The most serious outbreak was at Cork, where
the newly raised tosth (Leeds Regiment) and the u3th (Royal Birmingham
Volunteers) 'declared they would not be separated, they would serve His
Majesty together. Spurred by the publication of a handbill setting out their
case, the populace encouraged their resistance. The two regiments occupied
their barracks for three days before being overawed by militia and regular
Cavalry,25
Politically motivated mutinies in the 1790s were rare. Rumours spread that
little books' (almost certainly periodical copies of Tom Paine's The Rights
of Man) were circulating amongst northern militia regiments and there was
some distribution of radically inspired handbills. Subversive handbills (of
which some examples still exist) were distributed in Chatham, Maidstone
and Salisbury in 1797. In the same year, the more educated artillerymen
timed their disturbance at Woolwich in 1797 with that of the Nore Mutiny;
Despite the distribution of a protest handbill, the account of this incident
reads more like an industrial dispute than a revolutionary coup:
When the sailors seized their ships the royal artillerymen turned their
officers out of barracks, fortified themselves within the building, hung
out placards more pay and less drill'. They had long protested against the
food which was inferior and insufficient but had obtained no satisfaction,
and in resorting to this extreme measure of insubordination they declared
that their only object was to call attention to their grievances, Meanwhile

to their credit they carried on all garrison duties in good order and peace,
and when Government sent down a commission of enquiry, they made so
good a case that they were forgiven, and obtained a concession on nearly
every point of their demands.26
The strike settled to their satisfaction, like loyal soldiers elsewhere, they
turned on the subversive handbill distributor: ' the NCOs and men subscribed
a sum of money, which offered as a reward for the detection of the offender;
and further, signed voluntarily, a paper declaring their lovalty to the King

Disaffection was more common amongst Irish troops before the Rebellion
of 1798. Men from it Trish militia regiments, plus the sth Dragoons, were
court-martialled for sedition and many punished by flogging or transpor-
tation. This culminated in four of the Monaghan Militia being shot in May
1797, charged with being United Irishmen and for refusing to name other
members. During the rebellion itself, most militiamen soldiered loyally,
hough the sth Dragoons were disbanded. The evidence for reaction bu
serving troops to the subversive radical handbills of 1797 is mainly from
Trishmen. like the three marines executed at Plumouth The refusal at
Liverpool of 7o men of Midlorhian Light Dragoons (a fencible regiment) to
take ship for Ireland in May 1797 could have been linked to naval mutiny
and ongoing Irish ferment. The mutiny conspiracy of the 49th Foot in Upper
Canada in 1803 - which resulted in seven executions - may also have had
political connotations, given its laroe number of Trich rantere But it was
