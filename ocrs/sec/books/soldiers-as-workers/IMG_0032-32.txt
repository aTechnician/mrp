Soldiers as Workers
Indian courts? The army was easily the most populous part of the Anglo-
Indian community. In 1830, it consisted of 36,409 officers and men (of
both EIC and HIM services), 3,550 civilian EIC employees, and 2,149 other
Europeans: the Indian army was organised by its officers, not to make it
an efficient fighting force... but to provide an equal chance for everybody
to make his own fortune? Indeed, this was supported from the top by
both the EIC board and the British government with their jointly agreed
expansionist foreign policy, dictated and paid for by voracious conquest. It
offered opportunities for all for loot and trade. But HIM officers continued
still to make private fortunes in India As late as he Tient William
Forbes-Mitchell, landing at Calcutta, boasted to a collenoue of a grand
mansion: "I'll be master of that house and garden yet before I leave India"
Just thirty two years after, I took possession of the house No 46, where
I have established the Bon Accord Rope Works!35
Such activities quickly became a characteristic of other British colonies,
especially in the chaos and power vacuums of the French Wars. After
the conquest of St Domingo (Haiti) in 1797, some British officers took
possession of the sequestered estates of French royalists and challenged as
illegal Governor Simcoe's instructions to relinquish them. As well as being
noted for their disorder, the officers of the New South Wales Corps, formed
to protect the fledgling convict colony, had, by 1793, obtained a monopoly
of rum, the unofficial currency. By 1799, officers owned 77 per cent of the
colony's sheep, and after the corps was disbanded over the Bligh Mutiny
in 181o its officers went on to become the landed gentry of the continent.
Though each private of the New South Wales Corps was given 25 acres, most
land was then sold on to officers. After 1810, Australian garrisons consisted
of regular line regiments. Many of these soldiers were interested in acquiring
virgin land. Large grants were made to the Colonel of the 48th Foot in the
carly 1820s, and its adjutant, Lieutenant John Wild, an ex-ranker, owned
2,000 acres when he died in 1834.36
South America also saw attempts by army officers to amass large
fortunes. The ill-starred invasion of Buenos Aires in 1806-07, which ended
in a wholesale capitulation of the British army, was prompted bu Admiral
Pophan's persuasion of General Berestorm of Mae trading opportunities
opened up by South American wars of independence. Though the war was
a disaster: "Beresford sent home nearly eleven hundred thousand dollars of
prize money! Though Fortescue blamed sailors for chasing prize-money, it is

Class Structure and the British Army

clear that this desire was also shared by soldiers. Small wonder that officers
undertook private commercial transactions when British strategy during the
French Wars - especially in the blood and treasure allocated to the West
Indies - was heavily influenced by trading needs.37
Aristocracy
Certain regiments contained a high concentration of rich aristocrats. Whilst
a line infantry subaltern might, if careful, be able to live off his pay, a
cavalry subaltern needed a private income to supplement his salary. In the
early nineteenth century it was the Guards, based mainly in London, that
offered the most comfortable billet for aristocrats. Even the reforming Duke
of York argued, in the French Wars, that for young men of high rank and
fortune ... the Guards offer an opportunity of honourably pursuing the
military profession without subjecting themselves to those inconveniences
which would otherwise preclude their belonging to the service. One surgeon
reported of the three regiments of Horse Guards:
But I found the officers of this corps were not imbued with military
sentiment, as were those of many other cavalry regiments. Several had
no intention to follow the military profession. Heirs to large properties,
they had been placed in the blues [Royal Horse Guards] for a few years
to learn life, and see a little of the world; then to retire and take charge
of their own estates.
Less aristocratic officers had fewer chances of promotion in these regiments.
Captain John Whale of ist Life Guards was considered in 1817 to possess not
enough blood' to make Major.38
By 1850, there were 54 aristocrats in the cavalry, with half in the Horse
Guards and 142 in the infantry, with a third of these in the Foot Guards,
including 23 in the Grenadier Guards alone. Here the concentration of
languid non-professionals seems to have been the highest. Up until 1900,
no member of the three Household Cavalry regiments had gone through
the army's higher education Staff College, though this did not prevent some
of these members of these regiments being promoted to Generals. While
titled aristocrats were comparatively rare in the Victorian army, many officers
came from aristocratic families. The extraordinary number of aristocrats in
