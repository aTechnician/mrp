loot had been owned by murdered Europeans. Sergeant Forbes-Mitchell also
reported that the prize agents were disregarded and even illegally harboured
loot themselves: 'I could myself name one deeply encumbered estate which
was cleared of mortgage to the tune of £180,000 within two years of the
plunder of Lucknow'76
Looting and destruction were widespread in the wars against China in
1840-42 and 1860-61, and Abyssinia in 1867, with many officers involved.
Some larger pieces of plunder became part of collections in regimental and
ethnographic museums. The British Museum sent a representative with the
Abyssinian expedition and museum collections also benefited from loting
of 900 Benin bronzes and carved ivory in West Africa in 1897.
As late as the Boer War, 'military police struggled to contain the looting,
straggling and as the war dragged on, drunkenness among the regular,
irregular and colonial forces: In the same year, Private Frank Richards of
the Royal Welch Fusiliers serving in the Boxer Rebellion in China admited:
'At Tientsien there was tidy bit of looting ... pockets full of Mexican dollars
and unwieldy silver ingots? After the fall of Peking, the city would be given
up to loot for twenty-four hours. Our officers said that all loot must be taken
to a certain building for collection and redistribution. But nothing was taken
there. The difficulty ... [was) finding valuable things small enough to carry
off in a haversack'78
After battle, all loot was meant to be collected and sold by official army
prize agents and the money later distributed. But army prize money was
poorly organised compared with the Royal Navy. Perennial complaints were
made about its unfair distribution and the length of time of payouts, so that
widespread evasion took place. A complaint by James Miller of the isth Foot
about the capture of Havana in 1762 is typical:
Little however came to the share of the Non Commission's Officers, and
private men, owing to the two commanders in chief sharing one third
of the whole between them! ... how far this was consistent with equity
must be submitted to posterity, and whether after the most extraordinary
fatigues, in such a climate, the blood of Britons should be lavish'd to
agrandize individuals.?9
Distribution could take years. The prize money from the Isle de France
(Mauritius) campaign of 1810 was not distribyted until 1819, by which
