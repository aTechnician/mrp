continued after 1815 with only a third of French officers recruited between
1815 and 187o being graduates of military school. Under the Second Empire,
only 6 per cent of officers came from an aristocratic background and even
some absolutist countries, like the Austro-Hungarian Empire, pursued the
most egalitarian policies of officer recruitment and promotion ... cler fe
men of all conditions to become officers' 56
Nonetheless, in the British army, a steady trickle of exceptional former
NCOs were commissioned so that the elaborate drills and detailed adminis-
tration could continue to be well taught. The huge expansion of the army in
the French Wars led to a large increase in officer rankers. A good example
was Samue! Bircham of the goth Foot. A son of the regiment in which his
father was a Sergeant, Bircham enlisted as a drummer boy aged ten, fought
in the American War of Independence and became a sergeant. After bravery
at the Siege of Toulon in 1793, he was commissioned and campaigned in
the Mediterranean, in Ireland in 1798 and in the last Indies. Typically, for
a working-class officer without influence, he took many seconded jobs. In
1803, he drilled the Cambridge University Volunteers (which included the
undergraduate Lord Palmerston, soon to be appointed Secretarv-a+-War) and
went on to be acting Captain and adjutant of the Maltese militia. In the slow
post-war promotion, he continued down the colonial route, with a posting
to a Veteran battalion between 1823 and 1827. He joined the EIC's Madras
army in 1827 as a Major and finished as a Colonel of the Ceylon Rifles in
1834. Unlike most upper-class officers, these ranker officer/technocrats were
hard working. Bircham 'never had leave of absence for one month? But
Bircham was exceptional. The vast maiority of the rankers commicioned
in the French Wars remained junior offer and Adit cant too

peacetime army.57
Bircham was part of a family dynasty associated with the goth for many
decades. This became a typical pattern in many regiments. especially in
staffing key technical offices. John Rumsby emphasises the importance of

as Paymaster and Riding Master, with another as a Sergeant.58
In the French Wars, some NCOs were given commissions as a reward
for acts of extreme bravery in battle. John Shipp led the failed forlorn hope
at the abortive siege of Bhurtpore in India in 1805: 'Lord Lake accepted the
offer with great praise for my zeal, and promised - that if I survived I should
have a commission ... On the day of my appointment I was metamorphosed
into a gentleman. Typically, Shipp needed a patron to fund his officer's
expenses, with Lord Lake declaring: 'You may draw on me through the field
paymaster for all you want?59
Despite Wellington being against officers promoted from the ranks, the
Peninsular War threw up more examples from Spain. Sergeant William
Newman of the 43rd Light Infantry organised stragglers into a rearguard
during the retreat to Corunna, and was rewarded with an ensigncy in a
colonial corps: the ist West Indian Regiment. He was also given €50 from
the Patriotic Fund to cover the costs of his new uniform and equipment. The
heroism of Sergeant Pat Masterson of the 87th Foot at the battle of Barossa
in 18rl was unusually rewarded with a commission in his own regiment. But
this was for the unique feat of capturing the first French Imperial eagle.
Sergeant Charles Ewart of the Royal Scots Greys also captured a French
Eagle at Waterloo, and was awarded an ensigncy in a Veteran battalion.
However, his espousal of radical Swedenborgian views aroused official
suspicion and problems with his pension which led him to finishing his days
as a penniless fencing instructor in Salford.60
In typically snobbish style, Wellington unashamedly crammed his wartime
staff with young aristocrats: 'If there is to be any influence in the disposal
of military patronage in aid of military merits, can there be any in our army
so legitimate as that of family connection, fortune and influence in the
country?' Whilst their mistakes were overlooked, Wellington was ruthless
with the errors of social inferiors, Major Alexander Todd of the Royal Staff
Corps, a bridging expert, was the son of a butler, who achieved a commission
though his father's master. When one of his bridges broke down in southern
France in 1814, he was given a public dressing down by Wellington, which
finished with: 'Are you going to take up your father's trade? Todd was so
mortified he was deliberately reckless in the following day's fighting, which
as a combat engineer he should have avoided, and was killed. Similarly,
