Deliberate crime and penal corps
Whilst crime is not the main consideration of this study, certain crimes are
informative in revealing a spirit of resistance. The colonisation of Australia
with transported felons from the 178os was widely known amongst soldiers,
and the possibility of committing crime deliberately to secure a new life in
a temperate climate was appealing. Private Forbes deserted seven times in
1820s India before achieving transportation, whilst Private Ryder in Calcutta
struck his sergeant in the face: 'it was intended to effect his transportation
to New South Wales. By 1847, Private John Binkley of the 6ist Foot wrote
to his sister from India in the hot season:
[The regiment for the last month has been in rather a mutinous state, the
private soldiers are all for striking and knocking down sergeants without
the least fault, with the intention of getting out of the country. Last week
we had 3 men under sentence of death for it, but 2 of them have their
punishment mitigated to transportation for life.
Similar attacks were triggered by a rumour that the normal death penalty for
striking a superior officer would be commuted to transportation: "The very
thing that these scoundrels want under a delusion that they will be able to
get a ticket of leave and lelald a jolly life, according to one officer. Three
exemplary executions for the offence quietened the outbreak 136
The wily Indian Commander in Chief, Lord Hardinge, introduced a new
effective punishment regime in the 185os:
When men maim themselves or commit crimes as they have done in some
instances to obtain their discharge, and even to become convicts in New
South Wales a few years ago, the men were ordered to remain to perform
the duties of scavengers to the rest of the Regiment, according to the old
custom of the service ... to keep them as long as they live in the sight of
the Regiment as a warning to others to avoid the same fate.137
Some deliberate crime continued even in the UK and still after transpor-
tation ended. In 1876, Private James Little of the Royal Artillery broke a
jeweller's window in Greenwich and stole two watches because he would

sooner be hanged than remain any longer in the Army. As late as 1900,
Fusilier Richards reported: 'At home I have known men steal something
costly out of a shop, or smash a window, in the hope of a civil conviction
which would lead to their getting discharged? 138
Habitual military criminals, serial deserters or commuted capital prisoners
could be sent to penal units or condemned corps. These existed, under a
variety of names, in the late eighteenth century, to garrison slaving ports
in West Africa until brought together in 1804 in the Royal African Corps.
After 1807, they were active against the slave trade topether with local
black levies. Their key feature was their very high mortality rate because
of sickness, with some sources claiming that service amounted to a death
sentence: In West Africa, where a penal battalion annually buried about
eighty per cent of its strength? Unsurprisingly, these units experienced
mutinies themselves. In 1782, the notorious Joseph Wall, Governor of Goree,
had three mutineers flogged to death without trial, for which offence he was
later hanged at Newgate in 1802 The Roval A fian Corns had two mutinies
in 18to (with two ringleaders shot) and one in 1816.139
Typical of those posted to condemned corps' were Privates John Goodship
and Michael Reynolds of the goth Foot, who deserted and remained at large
for several months in 1807-08. Waterloo was the first campaign for which the
rank and file received medals, which were distributed on the first anniversary
of the battle in 1816. In the 73rd Foot, when William Hadley, a regimental
shoemaker, tried to claim his medal, his comrades objected, accusing him of
running away from the battle. The shame caused him to desert and he was
'eventually sent to a condemned regiment in Africa for life. As late as 1823,
incorrigible culprits in the British garrison on Cephalonia were being sent
to Sierra Leone to the 'Royal African Colonial Battalion'. This unit was not
disbanded until 1830, after which West African garrisons were provided by
black West Indian regiments 140
At the turn of the nineteenth century, over 5o per cent of troops sent to
the West Indies died, mainly of disease. With the huge forces mobilised
during the French Wars, more potential military criminals were available for
service in new 'condemned corps' there. Between 1799 to 1802, nearly 1,700
culprits were transported for life to the West Indies, along with difficult
soldiers from the
Royal African Corps. They were assembled eventually
