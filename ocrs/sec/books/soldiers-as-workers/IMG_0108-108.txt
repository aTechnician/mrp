were still imprisoned awaiting trial when peace came in 1815, minus two who
had died in captivity.104
Deserters continued to provide a portion of the comparatively well-paid
US army until British garrisons withdrew after Canadian Confederation
in 1867, fighting in many wars of American expansion. Irish sergeant John
Riley, after deserting south to the sth US Infantry, later became a dril
instructor at West Point Military Academy. Deserting again in April 1846,
he took service with the Mexican army just as the 1846-48 war broke out. He
led the Irish San Patrico battalion throughout the war, until captured by the
Americans. Saved from execution, which was the fate of 26 of his comrades,
because his desertion came before the declaration of war, Riley was fogged,
branded and discharged and went to live in Mexico,105
As will be discussed in a future volume, many ex-soldiers took service in
one of the overseas military interventions in South America, Spain, Portugal,
Greece and Italy. Generally, they were loyal to their liberal employers but
hungry deserters from the BAL in northern Spain in 1836, tempted by offers
of food and good wages, deserted to a Foreign Legion raised by their Carlist
opponents. They may have numbered as many as 400, even boasting their
own bagpiper, but bad treatment by the Carlists made some desert again,
this time to the BAL.106
India and Persia offered exotic opportunities for foreign service. Specialists,
like artillerymen or musicians, were particularly valued by Indian princes.
More than 100 rankers acted as drill sergeants to the forces of Tipu Sultan of
Mysore in the r78os, many recruited from captives after the British disaster
of Pollihur. When poised to go to war with the Marathas in 1804, the
EIC demanded that any British soldiers employed by the Maratha princes
should resign or be considered traitors. During the war in 1804, a British
artilleryman was caught attempting to desert to the Marathas and there were
still around 6o British specialists, especially artillery COs, in their service,
not all of whom accepted the amnesty from the EIC after war broke out 107

Indian campaigning: a drummer who had deserted from the 76th Foot at the

Class Conflict in the Army

Siege of Deig in 1804 and an EIC artillerman who organised the Gurkhas®
artillery (complete with English commands) in 1816. During the siege of the
supposedly impregnable Indian fortress of Bhurtpore in 1824-25, Bombardier
Herbert and gunners Henessey and O'Brian deserted to the Jat defenders,
improving the effectiveness of their artillery fire. After the British storming
of the city, Herbert (who had fought at Waterloo) was hanged and his two
comrades transported. Foreign service with the enemy continued in India
into the nineteenth century After the Burma camo do to eat an
returning, some British soldiers deserted and took service with the Burmese
princes. Another renegade was shot out of hand by the ard Foot in the
Gwalior campaion of 8 and there were all a fu path carving in tho
Sikh army in the 184os. One was bayoneted whilst trving to surrender by
British soldiers at the Battle of Sobraon 108
A few British fought with the Boers resisting the expansion of British
South Africa. After the battle of Boomplaats in 1848, the British captured
two deserters from the gist Foot serving with the Boer Voortrekkers. 'One
of these men, it is said, can be proved to have served the [Boerl gun' Private
Robert Hill was shot, whilst his comrade James Lapping was transported.
As well as taking service with the enemy, the severity of the sentence was
in response to the long term problem in South Africa of soldiers deserting
to the Boer settlements, which activelv offered worl such as cutting timber
The search raids for deserters by the gendarmerie of the Cape Mounted
Rifles contributed to the tension. 109
As late as the Crimean War, Irish soldiers in the trenches before Sebastopol
fraternised with a group of Trish sailors serving with the Russians. They tried
unsuccessfully to get them to change sides. Even in the unlikely and bloody
context of the Indian Mutiny, a few British fought alongside their revolting
sepoy comrades. There were rumours of many more,
as the quality of the
mutineers' gunnery was deemed superior to that expected from Indians. The
best documented is Sergeant Major Robert Gordon, a 44-year-old former
cabinetmaker from Galloway, who after service in the EIC artillery was an
instructor in 1857 with the 28th Native Infantry. Spared after their mutiny,
he joined their unsuccessful defence of Delhi and was subsequently captured.
Again spared summary execution, his
eventual trial was abandoned for
lack of evidence and he was discharged and returned to Britain. Gordon's
motivation seems to have been survival but others may have turned renegade
through the influence of Indian wives. 110
