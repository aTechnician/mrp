gentry yeomanry at Devizes. Overall, the local militia participated in 25
protests, including outbreaks in Herefordshire, Aberystwyth and Reading.34
The most significant consequence to these mutinous acts was at Ely, where
the Cambridgeshire local militia protested in June 1809 about a stoppage
for their knapsacks which occasioned the men to surround their officers
and demand what they deemed their arrears. Five ringleaders received the
severe sentence of 5oo lashes, and the punishment parade was guarded by
four squadrons of Hanoverian cavalry from the King's German Legion. The
use of German 'mercenaries led radical journalist William Cobbett to write
an apoplectic leader on the subject in his Political Register and resulted in
his imprisonment by the government for seditious libel. Two soldiers of the
regiment - James Newell, who went on to became a Sergeant, and Aaron
Layton, a balloted bricklayer - were later actively involved in the Ely and
Littleport riots of 1816. Both were transported for life, though commuted in
Layton's case .35
White troops of the EIC were renowned for mutinying for their rights,
with the first being recorded in 1674. In 1798, the European Madras
artillery's protest over arrears of pay and conditions of service was defeated
and six ringleaders were executed (one being blown from a gun following
the old Moghul practice). White EIC officers - from both local sepoy and
European regiments - also formed 'combinations' from the 17605.
culminated in a widespread officers' strike in the Madras Presidency in
1809, which was supported by their sepoys. The disturbances were ended by
white regular Crown troops, though 15o were killed in the clashes. Mutinies
by white EIC troops continued. In one year alone (1834-35) military courts
martial in Bengal alone (one of three Indian Presidencies) handed down
48 convictions for mutiny and mutinous conduct to its white troops, which
amounted to 3o per cent of all convictions. Black troops had a much better
disciplinary record; during the same period, only one sepoy was convicted
of the same offences. In the disastrous Kabul campaign of 1841-42, as the
Anglo-Indian army disintegrated, it was the British rank and file who
attempted mutiny and desertion when pay was lacking, rather than the loyal
sepoys, who soldiered to the last. 36

The relatively lax white regiments of the EIC were especially successful
in negotiation over work tasks. Stanley describes the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers
relusing to carry their knapsacks on a long march in 1843. They dropped
them in unison but agreed to carry their greatcoats, to save face with their
CO. In 1838-5, the White Mutiny' involved nearly 15,000 white troops
employed by the East India Company over enforced transfer to the Queen's
service. Led by spokesmen quoting radical rhetoric (one named Benjamin
Franklin Langford!), they occupied their barracks in what was described as
a Manchester Strike'. Apart from one execution and several imprisonments,
the protest was a complete success; 1o.116 out of 15,000 secured their
discharge and home passage, costing the government €250,000.37
Unsurprisingly, mutinies were typical of the overseas military interventions.

and mercenary adventurers while reliant an nau from foreien governments

In 1836, the 8th Battalion of the BAL in northern Spain mutinied, when
its officers attempted illegally to extend the soldiers' twelve-month contracts.
