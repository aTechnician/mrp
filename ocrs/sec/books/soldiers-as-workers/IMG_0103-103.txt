for the Sutlej campaign in 1845, it came to nearly e8 per soldier, indicating
why it was so tenaciously defended 83
Desertion
Desertion was a major problem for the nineteenth-century army. Despite
draconian punishments, soldiers found that this form of resistance, again
related to contract culture, could be effective. Joseph Cozens's recent study
of early-nineteenth-century desertion supports this view:
It will be argued that both enlistment and desertion were viewed by the
labouring poor not primarily in terms of loyalism or nationalism but
through the prism of the makeshift economy. Desertion, in particular,
was seen as a tactic for seizing control of the price and conditions of one's
labour and it was this concern which coloured the way in which the lower
orders saw armed service.
He further argues that: 'desertion begins to appear more like a conscious
act of protest than a spontaneous decision ... men deserted in order to seek
better work ... land) desireld) to evade capture and punishment, to find
gainful employment, and to support his dependants financially.84
Available statistics are varied over time, but all point to a serious situation.
In 1769, 8 per cent of rank-and-file soldiers on the Trish establishment were
absent without leave. Between 1800 and 1815, 37 per cent of all tried crimes
in the British army were for desertion, with 53 aro deserters in total between
1803 and 1812 (over 7,000 in 181s alone) Bounty jumpers were ecnecially
common in the chaotic recruiting of Firench Wars, with individuals enlisting
in multiple regiments, and deserting soon after ta hounty money was
received. The Duke of York, as Commander in Chief, planned on a desertion
rate of one in ten. To help keep track of these culprits, branding on the
hand or chest with 'D for Deserter' could be part of the court martial's
punishment and this was not abolished until par. Though punishable by
death, such were the manpower needs during the French Ware that only a
handful of executions took place in the fly and an amnesty was inteduced
in 1805 for existing deserters.85
In 1833, one in five men serving on the home establishment had been
imprisoned, with the most common crime being desertion. Ten years later,

there were 3,000 deserters in the UK, about i man in 14. By the time of
the Crimean War, 6 per cent of offences in the army related to desertion,
with young soldiers and recent recruits the most susceptible. Desertion was
worst in the infantry, where, in the 1840s, It. per cent of the home strength
was lost each year to this cause. There were much lower rates in the Foot
Guards (1.45 per cent), the cavalry (I.2 per cent) and with the 'tradesmen' of
the artillery (o.9 per cent),86
As will be discussed below, Canada was a particular desertion hot spot
throughout the period: in 1833, over 12 per cent of the British garrison
deserted and over 28 per cent in 1857. In terms of campaigns, the Peninsular
War threw up particular problems. The inhospitahle landscape often meant
that taking service with the French was the only way that stragglers could
stay alive. In all, s2 British soldiers were executed, for desertion to the enemy,
during the Peninsular War, along with 28 foreien allied troops. In every
battalion there were soldiers who simply disappeared. Even the elite 1/g5th
Rifles lost 21 unaccountable soldiers during the course of the war, with a
conservative overall estimate for Wellington's army of nearly 2,000 men.
Sometimes those who disappeared left official traces, like William Mason of
the 2/3oth who during the battle of Fuentes in 181l 'went over to the enemy'
before disappearing from history?7
Occasionally, rankers left records of their desertion journeys. In 1813, in
northern Smin. Sergeant Andrew Pearson of the Gret Foot was reduced te
the ranks after being mistakenly accused of withholding back pay from a
comrade. Outraged, he deserted and walked from the Pyrences to Oporto
and worked a passage to King's Lynn disguised as a Portuguese sailor. He
returned to his home in Northumberland and with the end of the war was
not prosecuted. He worked as a gardener on a local estate before writing his
memoir as an old man. Even more remarkable was the case of Private John
Riley of the 2/3oth Foot. Already under arrest for being absent without leave,
he slipped away from his guard during the march to besiege Burgos in 1812.
He reappeared again in October 1816 when the battalion was stationed in
Tralee, Ireland, and tried to claim his back pay. Recognised as a probable
deserter, his story of an amazing European journey as a prisoner of war
in Saragossa, Montpelier, Lyons and Hanover went to a regimental court
martial, with an assumption that, as an Irishman, he had taken service with
