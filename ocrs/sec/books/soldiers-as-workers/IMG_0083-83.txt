Dragoons, also had long police careers. By 1889, 8,000 ex-soldiers were
policemen, but this had apparently fallen to only 1,098 by 1913178
In the White Empire, ex-soldiers predominated in the founding force of
dominion constabularies. The first Australian mounted police were formed
in 1825 from soldiers of the 73rd Foot garrison to counteract bushrangers.
They remained on regimental rolls and under military discipline for 25 years.
This seems appropriate, given that their early service in New South Wales
amounted to a guerrilla war against bushwhackers and aborigines. Buck
Adams of the 7th Dragoon Guards includes his service in the gendarmerie
of the Cape Mounted Police in his memoir. Other ex-troopers, like Joseph
Lane of the i3th Light Dragoons, became a Royal Canadian Mounted
Policeman, and received an 8o-acre land grant on retiring in 1880.79
Uniformed working class
Police service was only one of range of opportunities in the Victorian period
for ex-soldiers in the new, mainly uniformed working cass in prisons,
railways, post offices, libraries, museums and workhouses.
Despite the same reservations as were voiced with military recruits to
the police, prison work attracted ex-servicemen in considerable number. By
1876, two-thirds of warders had an army or navy background. Some rose to
the highest echelons of the service. Edwin Cowtan, an ex-ranker cavalry
Adjutant, finished his thirty-year prison career as governor of Wakefield
Prison. John Shipp had enjoyed an unprecedented military career, being
commissioned twice from the ranks in the early nineteenth century, which
finished in civilian life as Superintendent of Liverpool's Night Watch police
force and then as Master of Liverpool Workhouse, an amazing achievement
for a Suffolk workhouse orphan. The tramways of Victorian cities gave
opportunities for specialist soldiers like John Cunningham, an ex-Sapper
in the Crimea, who was a Watchman for Huddersfield Trams, who when
he stepped down through poor eyesight was provided with a Corporation
pedlar's licence. 180
Across Europe, minor public service jobs were reserved for ex-soldiers,

but in the UK the process was left to private philanthropy and the market.
As carly as 1814, the Colonel of the 7th Light Dragoons was providing a
recommendation for an ex-trooper seeking a post at the East India Company
warehouse. Anne Crosby claims that smart regiments like the Rifle Brigade
maintained contact after discharge and were paternalistically concerned for
their ex riflemen to obtain access to minor civil service or Post Office jobs.
Cardwell short-term enlistment increased the volume of ex-servicemen
needing jobs. Successive late-Victorian governments toyed with employment
schemes or reserved government posts, with little success Instead. oCcer-led
paternalistic national, regimental and local organisations emerged, like the
Corps of Commissioners formed in 1850 and specialising in finding posts for
armless discharged soldiers. After the Wantage Committee of 1892, some
junior civil service jobs were reserved for ex-soldiers, but these amounted
to fewer than 5,000 places. Nonetheless, by 1913, 19,500 ex-servicemen were
attendants and porters.181
found in menial civil service posts as messengers, watchers, park keepers,
The attendants at the Great Exhibition in 185t were mainly ex-soldiers.
They were kitted out with quasi-military uniforms on which they were
entired to wear their medals. The Fritish Museum in London seems to have
recruited many ex-soldiers, including disabled ones, and may explain why
the building was fortified and staff issued with firearms in the preparation
for the expected Chartist coun in 1818. A typical career might be that of
Private Henry Hook of the 24th Foot, who won the VC in the defence
of Rorke's Drift in 1879. A Gloucestershire man, he bought himself out
of the army in 188o after only three vears' service. He then worked at the
British Museum for the next 24 years, in the portering staff. He became
Foreman of Library Dusters and then Umbrella Caretaker, posts which he
combined with that of part-time Sergeant Musketry Instructor for the ist
Volunteer battalion of the Poval Fusiliers and as a temperance advocate.
Another respectable uniformed career path for a few of the many pious
ex-rankers were the missionaries employed by religious societies of many
denominations, such aste Arms Scripture Readers and the Soldiers' Friend
Societies. They were evangelising both at home, especially in working class
areas, and in the Empire.182
