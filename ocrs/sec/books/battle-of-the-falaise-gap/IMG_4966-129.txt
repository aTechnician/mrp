The Corridor of Death
"Kommandant, Komm schnell, komm schnell!"
at the end of his tether.
How many volunteers were left of those he had managed
to rally at about midnight to accompany him on this breakout,
an extraordinary assault which defied the imagination? For a
whole night and then a whole day, long columns of thousands
of men were to cross a broad plateau under a hail of fire,
then a deep river and a road patrolled by Canadian tanks.
They would cling to a slope dominated by sheer cliffs, held
by the Poles, ridges which the Germans had to cross in order
to gain freedom on the Vimoutiers plateau.
Kurt Meyer that morning had kept only 200 men,
"deter--
mined to use their
weapons". Accompanied by General
Elfeldt, Obersturmführer Koln and his faithful Michel, the
cover the northern flank of the breakout, then to cross the
Dives in the wake of the parachutists led by Meindl, II Corps
Commander. That afternoon under a leaden sky, Kurt Meyer
groaned and gasped for breath.
"Komm, Kommandant, another 10o yards Kommandant.
Komm!"
Michel walked faster. Meyer trailed, allowing himself to lag
behind in his exhaustion.
"The sweat ran into my smarting
eyes and my old head wound opened." 1 He knew
tree and every bush between Trun and Chambois", having
occupied the region before the transfers of June 6th, and knew
that his only hope was to take the path between Coudehard
Height on the left and Mont Ormel to the right. But how to get
there with no means of communication and all these roads
completely blocked?
