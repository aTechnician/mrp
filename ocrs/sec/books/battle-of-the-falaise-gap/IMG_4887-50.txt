Fifty-five tanks advanced across the battle-ravaged plateau.
Weaving between craters, they climbed the line of the ridge
and dipped into the hollows, re-appearing and again disappear-

which stood between the valleys of the Laison and Laize rivers.
"Visibility lousy", groaned a driver as he peered at the
horizon. Situated 8 kilometres from the startline, a little above
Cauvicourt, the foothills which shield Falaise are normally

Even if they had been able to navigate by eye, the drivers of
the 28th Armoured Regiment—one of the three regiments of

Hill 195 for example, on the right and to the south-west, was
almost identical to hill 140, to the left and south-east. Between
them the hilly road from Caen meets the line of high ground
and follows the gradient down to Falaise.
