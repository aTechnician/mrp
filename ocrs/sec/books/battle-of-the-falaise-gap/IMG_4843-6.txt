Foreword
Overshadowed by the landing in Provence, the operations of
the resistance and
the Allied advance on Paris, the military
events, which within a few days led to the destruction of the
Seventh German Army in the Argentan-Falaise pocket, have so
far been a closed book to most people.
No one book has yet been devoted to this battle, defined by
the German combatants enclosed in this "cauldron" as a "real
Stalingrad" in Normandy; a battle on the scale of a world event
conduct—paradoxically—prolonged
several months, although at the same time it speeded up the
liberation of Belgium, Luxembourg and France.
The story of this battle which took place in a region off the
great main highways deserves for both these reasons to be told,
allowing, where possible, its actors and eye-witnesses to speak
All military ranks referred to in the book are as they were
in August 1944•
