The Battle of the Falaise Gap
welcome the Secretary of State to the Treasury, Henry Morgen-
thau, who was making a tour of the European theatres of war.
Around Mortain the fate of the battle was still undecided,
although the front was settling down. Mortain had now be-
come a secondary battlefield so much so that Bradley, show-
ing Morgenthau the breach opened by the Germans south of
Mortain-the enemy in fact was still in control of the Saint-
Jean-du-Corail-Milly road, the jumping-off point for the second
of the Nazi counter-offensives in the direction of Saint-Hilaire-
du-Harcouet-took the liberty of saying: "If the other fellow
will only press his attack here at Mortain for another 48 hours,
he'll give us time to close at Argentan and there completely
destroy him."
And when the Secretary of State, not entirely convinced,
shook his head, Bradley insisted: "This is an opportunity that
comes to a commander not more than once in a century. We're
about to destroy an entire hostile army." ®
