The Battle of the Falaise Gap
Express collected in The Falaise Road (W. H. Allen); the
works of Alan Moorehead, Montgomery's biographer, and the
dispatches of d'Arcy Dawson published under the
title
European Victory (Macdonald).
VIII. Memoirs
Most of the dialogues in this book were actually spoken,
written, extracted from the Memoirs of the Allied War Leaders
or reported by their biographers:
Bradley: A Soldier's Story (Holt, 1951).
Patton: War as I Knew It (Houghton Miffin, 1947).
Wallace: Patton and his Third Army (Military Service
Publishing Co., Harrisburg, 1946).
Butcher: My Three Years with Eisenhower (Simon and
Schuster, New York, 1946).
Ingersoll: Top Secret (Harcourt, Brace, New York, 1946)
Robert S. Allen: Lucky Forward, The History of Patton's
Third U.S. Army (New York, Vanguard Press, 1947).
IX. Eye Witnesses
We should quote a thousand people who helped us. The
kindness and help we met with in Maine and Normandy
afforded us many enjoyable moments and enabled us to
make many
friends. 700 eye
witnesses—mayors,
farmers-contributed to this work. All of them by their keen-
ness, correspondence, and their own personal researches have
shown how their experiences at Avranches, Mortain, Alençon,
Trun, Saint-Lambert, Tournai, Chambois and Argentan have
remained indelibly in their minds. They are a living testimony
to the immense kindliness of this French province.
I would like to
express
my
gratitude
to Stanislaw
Schwarzburg-Gunther, officer of the 2nd
Polish
Armoured
Regiment, for all his efforts on the spot in London in assisting
with and improving the original text of the French and English
editions. His knowledge of French and of English and, at the
same time, of the actual events in which the 2nd Polish
Armoured Regiment took part has been invaluable.
And finally I must thank my wife, a patient proof reader and
severe critic, who helped with this book by spending eleven
years of research in Normandy.
