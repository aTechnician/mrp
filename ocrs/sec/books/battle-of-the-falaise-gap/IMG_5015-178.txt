The Battle of the Falaise Gap
Diese Abteilung hat wirklich etwas geleistet, ihren toten
und lebenden Soldaten gohört unser Respekt." (Major
Currie on August 19th had advanced as far as Saint-
Lambert-sur-Dives and had effectively closed the only
route of escape from this "kettle". His detachment fought
a great fight and our homage is due to the dead and sur-
vivors of this action). Let us add that Major Currie is one
of the 16 Canadians who won the V.C.

We leave to General Simonds's brother—a very remark-
able man—the responsibility for his verdict, which we
have quoted here as of psychological interest (Simonds:
