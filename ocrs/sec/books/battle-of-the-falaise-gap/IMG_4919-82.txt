"Well, haven't the Boche gone?"
Abbé Launay had slept little that night: in the wake of the
motorized vehicles which, with lights extinguished, crossed the
village main street without too much din, he thought he had
heard an "All Right". No doubt about it, the British had
arrived ..
When the curé went out at 0530 hours, one could imagine
his disappointment on finding a German Red Cross flag flutter-
ing on a farm near the church. "The morning was not yet
come," sighed Abbé Launay, "when the church bells would
ring for the Feast of the Assumption and liberation."
His village, Tournai-sur-Dives, now caught in a pincers be-
tween the Canadian front to the north and the American front
to the south was, for better or worse, adjacent to the only
escape route now left open to the Seventh Army. Whether it
retreated to Flers or descended from Falaise, the trek would
inevitably have to take the road junction nearby at Trun.
Meanwhile, von Kluge at château Fontaine-l'Abbé-under
the lime arbour whose vault sheltered two long columns of
armoured cars, limousines and amphibian craft-detailed the
escort which would accompany him to Nécy: a motorbike
and sidecar driven by Major Behr, a car in which Lieutenant
Tangermann, his aide and himself would ride, and a radio
car... in fact a perfect target for the fighter bombers.
It was very hot. Progress was slow. Touques had to be
crossed to the east of Livarot, and the tank tracks followed
across the fields, to fox the fighter bombers, as there was no
cover on the bare heights.
The meeting with Eberbach and Dietrich had been fixed for
1000 hours. It was already 0930 hours, and Nécy was still 80
kilometres away. Major Behr on his motorbike proposed leaving
