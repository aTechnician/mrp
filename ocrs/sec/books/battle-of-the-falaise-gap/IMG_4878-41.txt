position of Allied and German forces during
Operation Totalize
On Tuesday morning, August 8th, there were no sentries
posted outside the Mutuelle générale, the HQ of the Seventh
German Army in Le Mans. A few idle men in caps were guard-
ing a pile of chairs on the pavement outside the abandoned
pillboxes.®
A few hundred yards farther south, on the other side of the
Sarthe-all its bridges had been destroyed except one, the
Gambetta Bridge, still used for the ebb and flow of enemy
units passing interminably across it-nine citizens of Le Mans

The night had been a nightmare of fires, explosions and
destruction. The Germans were evacuating. One after the other
six bridges collapsed into the Sarthe, the blast blowing plaster
off the neighbouring houses, ripping off shutters, doors and

hour or two at the most because they did not know where the

Souligné road, while to the south and south-east, Combat Com-
mand A of General Oliver's Armoured Division coming from
Château-Gontier, skirted the city by the suburb of Pontlieue.
None of the nine men of Le Mans hidden near the Gambetta
Bridge knew anything of these movements. All that Canon
Breteau could see at the neck of the bridge was a section of
machine-gunners who had already primed 42 land-mines in
bunches of three which, if fired, would cut the town in two.
All he could hear was the distant rumble of guns.
Then, from their shed the nine men heard wild cheering
coming from the west. Someone near the Croix d'Or cried:
"Here they are!" and immediately, relates Louis Daret, "People
