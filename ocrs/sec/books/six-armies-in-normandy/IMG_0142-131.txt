CHAPTER 6
The Honour of the German Army
THE DYING GASPS of the Goodwood offensive should have sounded
sweet in Hitler's ears. But his ears, on July zoth, were ringing with
different sounds. At 12.30 p.m. on
that day he had entered his
conference room at Rastenburg in East Prussia - the Wolf's Lair -
where the Führerhauptquartier was currently installed. The time of
the first daily briefing had been advanced by half an hour because he
was to receive Mussolini in the afternoon.
The setting had been

Jod's adjutant, with six of his own, drawn from the army, navy, air
force and SS; the permanent representatives at Führerhaup quartier
of the army, navy, S5 and ministry of foreign affairs; and the duty
stenographers. The rest were visitors: Heusinger,
the head of the
operations branch at Army Headquarters (OKH); Korten, chief of
the air staff; Bodenschatz,
Göring's personal staff officer; and
Brandt, Heusinger's staff colonel.
The conference began at once, though Keitel, the head of OKW,

clutched in the three remaining fingers of his one arm. Hitler had
seen him recently twice before,
but Keitel nevertheless formally
presented him: Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg,

sentative
of the training and replacement command (Ersatzheer),
