CHAPTER I
Fourney to the Second Front
THESE REVELATIONS of hidden Allied discord had for a child - in the
I950s a schoolboy - who had been reared not merely in the political
atmosphere but on the substance of Anglo-American co-operation,
the power to shock, strongly enough to set up walls of disbelief. With
all the fervour of a convert, once brought to accept the hollowness of
Britain's splendid isolation, I had replaced that faith with another
which distinguished not at all between the interests of the United
States and the United Kingdom, scarcely, indeed, between the
identities of the two societies.
Britain and the
United States,

pursued different military ends, could in the process have formed
resentments, nurtured suspicions, manoeuvred, equivocated,
sembled, treated with third parties, played for time were ideas that I
simply could not credit. And I was right to doubt. For, in the history
of the wartime alliance, it is the unity and good faith of the two
powers which stands out, and their differences of opinion and
divergence of aims which seem trivial and secondary. But it was also
right to be taught to look beyond the appearance of unanimity. In
the real world the Britain in which I grew up was a power already in
decline, the United States poised on the brink of succession to her

decision, once war was thrust upon her, to make her main effort in
Europe remains, therefore, even in retrospect, a remarkable one.
And the paths by which she arrived at it, and held her chief ally to
her chosen method of implementing it - the invasion which we have
