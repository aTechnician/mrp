CHAPTER 2
All-American Screaming Eagles
PARACHUTING HAD COME LATE to the
Allied armies. Until the
outbreak of the war, it had been known to the West only through the
reports of British and French observers at the Soviet 1936 man-
oeuvres and from some shaky but unnerving propaganda film later
released by the Red Army.
Shot through the turbulence of the
camera aircraft's slipstream, it had shown a file of wind-tortured
automata climbing from the door of a giant Tupolev transport,

This weird footage, as if

gymnastics may indeed just have inspired it
- still possesses the
power to alarm and to mystify. In those who saw it at the time its
effect was to
evoke disbelief in the applicability of anything
necromantic to the operations of war.
Four years later its applicability
was demonstrated all too con-
vincingly in the skies of applicetherlands by the Germans, who in the
interval had formed and trained a whole division of parachutists
which they used to bypass and nullify the defences of Fortress
Holland in a single day. But the aura of witchcraft continued to
attach to military parachuting well beyond that.
The idea of a large,

to fight on the ground as conventional infantry, seemed one which
the popular imagination could not assimilate, preferring to feed on
the image of the parachutist as troll or warlock.
Nuns in jackboots
had been one of the half-comic, half-terrifying rumours circulating
in Britain in the months after Dunkirk and even in the following
year, when the threat of invasion had receded, a respectable English
