Acknowledgments
I have been fortunate enough to visit the battlefields of Normandy
several times, first as a schoolboy in 1953 when memories of the
events of 1944, still strong today, were in the forefront of Norman
minds; again in 1965; and finally in 1977, while this book was in
preparation. I am grateful to all those who have talked to me about
D-Day and its aftermath, particularly those whom I heard speak on
the ground where they had actually served. They include General
Sir
John Mogg, Lieutenant-General Sir Napier Crookenden,

for help with the procurement of documentary and manuscript
material to Captain L. Milewski, of the Sikorski Institute, London,
to Mr C. P. von Luttichau, of the Office of the Chief of Military
History, Washington, to Dr R. Suddaby, Keeper of Archives at the
Imperial War Museum, London, and to the staffs
of the Mili-
tärgeschichtlichesforschungsamt, Freiburg, and the Service histori-
que de l'armée, Vincennes. M. Albert Grandais, a Norman historian
and author of La Bataille de Calvados (Presses de la cité, 1974) was
especially helpful with local material, and my
friends Jean-Claude
and Marie-Hélène Cuirot, of Bretteville-sur-Odon, were kind hosts.
Much help came as always from fellow members of the academic
staff at Sandhurst, among whom it is such a pleasure to work: David
