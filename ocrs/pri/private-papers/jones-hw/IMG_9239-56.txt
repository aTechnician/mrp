• It has come to my notice that on a recent w shops inspeotion
of your Vehioles a high standard of maintenance has been kept by the Drivers,
also the administration has not been negleated in that all inspeotions were
to date where concivably possible and that the AB 412's were in perfoct
order.
I would like you to thank the NO O's and men on my behalf,
tolling them that this indeed is the wey to keep the Transport on the road
and to be able to deliver the' Goods' at the right time end place.
You must obviously know that at the present time it
1s
very
difficult to get spares or replacements which we greatly need and that
the
Vehicles have now done their "life mileage' and are literally falling to
pieces, nevertheless, we nust keep the 'Wheels Turning' and use these
same
Vohioles to carry out our last successful operation.
Keep this good work up, you have , fine reliable men in 1641
Platoon - Believe me.
