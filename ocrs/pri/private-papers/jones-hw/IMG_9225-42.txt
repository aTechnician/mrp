CHRISTMAS 1944
PERSONAL MESSAGE
From the
ARMY COMMANDER:
Since the First Canadian Army came into operational existence, on 23 July, and
commenced its first great battle on 7/8 August—thrusting
South and East from
CAEN—it has gone many places and done great things.
It has fought forward some four hundred and fifty miles, through FRANCE,
BELGIUM and HOLLAND.
It has met, and defeated, either in whole or in part,
fifty-nine enemy divisions of which eleven were SS and Panzer type and forty-eight
were Infantry and other types. It has captured from the enemy nearly one hundred
and twenty thousand prisoners. It has a right to be proud of its record.
Now, in the final analysis, whatever the ability of a senior Commander and th
expertness of his Staff, victory on the battlefield is mainly due to the skill, the spiri
and the determination in which the military plans are carried out by the regimenta
officer and man. In these essential requirements, no Army has ever been better
The First Canadian Army has been fortunate, throughout, by the inclusion in it
of | British Corps. In that Corps, and sometimes in 2 Canadian Corps, we have had
Scottish, English,
Polish and US Divisions as well as Canadian.
We have had with us
contingents from our Belgian, Netherlands and Czecho-Slovak Allies. But, whatever
the nationality of such for theions, they have fitted, perfectly, into their places in the
and played their part with the greatest distinction. I have reason to
believe that, in complementary fashion, I Canadian Corps in the Eighth British Army
has done likewise.
This does not read like a Christmas message and yet, in my opinion, the facts
which I have stated point the way to that state of peace and goodwill on earth which
must be the aim of all right thinking men-thoughts which should be in the forefront
of our minds at this time of year. If, after we have beaten Nazi Germany to its knees,
the Allied nations can subordinate their selfish interests to the collective good-
in the manner which has been so effectively demonstrated during these months of
battle by the several national formations of the First Canadian Army-we need have
no doubts as to the future happiness and advancement of the countries of our birth.
In the meantime, the best of luck to all and let us lose no time or opportunity
to finish off this business, completely and convincingly.
December, 1944.
(H. D. G.CCinr) General
First Canadian Army
