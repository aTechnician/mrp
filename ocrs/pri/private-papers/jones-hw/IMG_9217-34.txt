SHORT FORM OF WILL.
(Write Will on next page.)
It a soldier on active service, or under orders for active service,
wishes to make a short Will,
he may do so on the next page.
It must be entirely in his own handwriting and must be signed
by him and dated.
The full names and addresses oi the persons
whom he desires to benefit, and the sum of money or the articles or
property which he desires to leave to them, must be clearly stated.
The mere entry of the name of an intended legatee on the noa!
page without any mention of what the legatee is to receive is at me
legal value.

In the event of my death I give the whole of my property and
effects to my mother, Mrs. Mary Bull, 999, High Street, Aldershot.
(Signature) GEORGE BULL,
