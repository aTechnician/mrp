(30) Flank Communication.
Laying down a procedure for flank communication does not authorize its use unless
the message is of extreme urgency.
There are two systems (a) Normal, Control does not
take part (b) When Control retains command of net.
System (a) is more suitable for R.A.C. working as discipline should be so good that
an outsta would not pass a message by this means unless it was of extreme urgency.
A Normal.
