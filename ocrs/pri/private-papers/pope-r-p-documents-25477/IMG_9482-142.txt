EVIDENCE - INTRODUCTION.
1.. Sec 128 directs that the evidence admissible at Courts Wartial shall
be that admissible in the civil cours
It is universally agreed that the
-sane rule coplies whenever a man is ipon trial, e.g.
before an O.C. Sub-Unit,
and alsc at the taking of a sunny of Evidence.
It is therefore of great
importance that a grasp should be pitaired of at least the main points
set cut hereunder.
Fuli astails are nontainod in the Mi.M.l. chapter VI.
It must be remembered that evidence, supplemented only by facts of which
judicial note can be taken (e.g, that we are at war, or relative rank in
the army) is the material with which the prostcuticn nust prove beyona
reasonable doubt the substance of the effence alleged.
It is not necessary
to prove more than the "substanse" of the charge for under R.P. 44, a C.M.
oan cone to a "special firding" e g, gui ty of stealing only 50 oigarettes
whereas the charge alleged 100.
Bat it will not do to prove any offence
other than the one alleged, unless the case comes under Sea 56, which
authorises this in certain specified circumstances e g. a conviction for
absence withnut leave upon a charge of desertion.
Indirect evidence - often callec. circunstantial evidence - must be
distinguished fron inadnissible evidence
If "in"
swears he saw "B" stab "a"
this is direct evidence of sush stabbing oy 3 .
If "4" proves he fcund "C"
weunded and "X" proves finding nearby a bilod-stained knife which he recegnises
as belonging to "B" this is perfectly goca indirect evidence.
Leading questions (which must not be asked 'in chief' are questions
which suggest the answer desired, eg "were the reads slippery"
