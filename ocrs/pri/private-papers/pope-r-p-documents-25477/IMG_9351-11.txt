In mid-August 1944, the 9' Beach Group was disbanded. The supply depot at
Crépon was closed. The port at Cherbourg was open,
"Mulberry B" at
Arromanches was functioning and the bridgehead had been enlarged. These
factors allowed the deployment of the classical logistic units, which were known
"Lines of communications of the 21" Army Group". The zone containing
these depots had been greatly enlarged. The infantry battalion of the 9" Beach
Group, the 2d Hertfordshire Regiment, was disbanded into companies sent to
reinforce other infantry battalions that had suffered heavy losses in the course of
the battle. As for the logistic units of the 9th Beach Group, they integrated with
lines of communications units.
