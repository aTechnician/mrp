for one reason or another ought now to be given some relief. They
only have it if others are willing to share the burden and help the
neighbours in a task laid on the district as a whole.
THE ROLL
Will you therefore agree to your name being entered on a roll of tho
ready, if and when called on, to help in receiving the children now in th
district and any others who may have to be sent if raids take place, so fe
as your circumstances permit ?
You need not feel that if you do th
the whole burden will fall only on members of the roll. Local authoritie
have powers which will be used in case of need to enforce a fair distribution
I made it clear in my recent broadcast that there is no better way
in which a householder in one of the safer areas can help in nationa
defence than by allowing his name to be added to this roll.
I would
therefore
ask. you, if you are able, to complete the enclosed form
and send it to the Clerk of the local Council.
If you did promise to take
children a year ago, the return of the form will confirm your offer.
After the form is returned you will be visited to find out what
accommodation you would be willing to provide.
If you are already receiving children you have a special claim to have
your name included in the roll, and should be sure to send in the form so
chat this may be done.
APPLICATION TO JOIN THE ROLL
I wish my name to be placed on the roll of those ready to
share in the work of receiving and caring for school children
already in this district or who may be sent here under the
Government Evacuation Scheme.
Signed.
