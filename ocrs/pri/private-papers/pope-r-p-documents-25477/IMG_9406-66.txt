Wo inalude today an effort from the pivilian front. :
LI you, can keep yourself fron going crackers
At all tha things you are told to do
When Hitler sends along his sir attaclara
And Flying bombs
to try and frighten you;,
If yau can hear
the scroaming
siren's warnins
Without that sinking feeling in your breast;
If
you can sleep in dug-outs
till the mornin
And, nevor feel you ought to have a rest;
If you can laugh at every black-out stumble.
Hor murmur when you cannot find a Pub;
If you can eat your ratiuns and not grunte
About the wicked price you pay for grun;.
If you can keep depression down to Zero,
And view it all as just a bit of fun;
The - Sir - yau'll be a bloody, hero,
And what is more you'll be the only one.
