(a) Annex I shows the estimated D/W tonnage of stores which will be landed
(incl "dry-shod") during the Exercise. 19 Jul tu 2 Aus, totalling 22,684 tons.
These are divided into Maintenance 15,923 tons and Reserve 6.756 tons, the
figures being, shown under each sub-division in para l.
(b) The function of the RS Sec during he Exercise is to nuve out of EMA
dumps and FMA depots each day, to appropriate commodity RHs, tonnage of stores repre-
senting Staff estimates of consumption by the Force ( if it were all on the
ground in a real battle) less actual consumption by the tos engoged in the
Exercise, serving the double purpose of:
(1) practising dumps and depots in issuing roughly the same tonnages
as they would in war:
(i1), disposing of the stores handled in the Exercise.
The tonnages which R$ Sec will move each day will be based on the Mainten-
ance figures in Annex I, which are the staff estimates referred to above, and
the actual consumption (obtained daily from Statistics Sec); with any necessary
adjustments caused by substantial departures from the landing programe.
