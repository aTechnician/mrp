SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS - TINNED FISH
RASC(A) 2008/43
dated 6 Jan 43.
1. Demands on A.F. F726 for fish, tinned, are normally met by the C.P. 0.
(Food Supplies) by supply in the proportions of 50% Salmon; 25, Herrings;
25 sardines, but the actual allocation of each variety depends on the
stock position at the S. R. Ds.
2. As the scale of issues for Salmon and Herrings is 3/7 oz, and the Sardines 2/7 oz,
it has been found in many cases that accumulation of stocks of Sardines in
C. S. Ds has resulted.
3. In order to meet the situation, it has been ruled under authy W. O. U. M.
53/Gen/ 5440(ST6) at 30 Dec 42 that Fish, tinned, will be demanded on the basis
of an all round ration of 3/7 0z. In meeting these demands, the C.P. 0. will
reduce the weight of sardines supplied to coincide with the ration scale, in
the following manner, eg:-
Total demand for fish, tinned
10,000 lbs
Supply by C.P. O. (Food Supplies)
Salmon & Herrings
7,000 "
thus leaving a balance of 3,000, which the C.P. 0. (Food Supplies) is able
to meet in Sardines.
The 3,000 lbs is therefore reduced by one third to
coincide with the scale of issue for Sardines, and the demand is consequently
met by C.P.O. (Food Supplies) as follows :-
Salmon and Herring
Sardines
7,000 Ibs
2,000 1bs
Total supply against total demand for
fish, tinned, of 10,000 lbs
22000 10s
4. The above insts will commence with A.F. F726 due at this H.Q. 15 Jan 43
for this month and the 17th of each month from FEB onwards.
5. Sufficient space will be left on A. F.F 726 against this item to enable the
"O. to insert the quantities and commadities to be delivered in satisfaction
thereof.
