In vánor tactios an appreciation is purcly a nonsal considoration
of a
problen frou which a foolproof plan can be produced.
In larger oporations a
written approciation naturally becones necessary in ordor that nono of tho
nutorous factors are ovorlooked.
In war under nodorn Battlo conditions a acthodical
consideration of a

be possible if the ind is trained to work to an accepted
sequence of thought.

4 Precautions for change-over of engines oils: - Owing to the increased flushing action
of H.D. lubricants, it is desirable, wherever possible, when the change-over is made, to
drain the engine when bot, flushing it with H.D. oil of the specified grade, giving a run
of 30 minutes before draining out flushing oil then refilling with a new supply of H. D.
grade.
Cartridge type filters should be renewed 300 miles after the change to the new oil.
All removablefilters should be inspected, and cleaned or renewed, at time of change-over
and after 300 miles. The engine oil should, if necessary, be renewed at the same time.
Particular attention should be paid to the oil pressure gage, where fitted,
