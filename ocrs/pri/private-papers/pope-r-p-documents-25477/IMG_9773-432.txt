GOVERNMENT EVACUATION
SCHEME
A YEAR AGO I appealed to householders in the safer areas to help
in time of war by receiving school children from the big cities. Since
then our evacuation scheme has been carried out and we are preparing
further plans to be put in force if air attacks develop.
THE TASK AHEAD
At the moment we are faced with a double task, to prepare for the
future and to keep in the safer areas all the children who are already
there. The first piece of work must be done by the Government and the
public authorities. The second can only be done by the children's parents
and the householders in the receiving areas.
SHARING THE BURDEN
There are over 400,000 evacuated children now in the receiving areas,
and this is an important contribution to our national defence. But the
burden of this most valuable work has fallen almost entirely on the
half-million or so householders who have had children in their houses for
an appreciable time.
In response to the Government's appeal last year offers were made to
receive 2,300,000 children. Only about a quarter of these offers have
been taken up. Is it fair that the whole burden should fall continuously
on one man—or rather one woman—in four ?
I do not want to suggest that billets should be disturbed unnecessarily.
It is far better for the child to have a settled home. But many householders
