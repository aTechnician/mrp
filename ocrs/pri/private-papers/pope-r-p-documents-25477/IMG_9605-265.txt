SUPFLIES - Introduction of New Iubricants.
1. Distribution - New motor lubricants will be introduced over the next few
months.
For the present they will be additional to existing grades but will in time
replace
them.
They are in agreement with U.S. Army requirements.
(a) Engine oils - The new grades contain a detergent substance which makes them
suitable for Caterpillar, General Motors and other high speed Diesel engines at present
calling for special lubricants.
They are equally beneficial, but not a necessity, for
petrol driven engines.
During the period when old and new grades are in supply simultaneously, use of
H. Do oils should be restricted, where possible, to
Diesel engines.
It is preferable
vehicle
having once changed
over to new type lubricants, that they remain in use thereafter,
although in emergency this is not imperative. Cettain precautions at the time of
change-over are desirable and are given in para. 4o
(b) Gear Oils - There are no new transmission oils, since Hypoid 80 and Hypoid 90
are already in use.
(c) Greases - An improved range of greases will be available (see para. 5 below).
