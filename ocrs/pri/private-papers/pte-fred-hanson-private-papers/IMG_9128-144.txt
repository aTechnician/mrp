Gardner 6 cylinder diesel
Tractor Heavy Breakdown 6 x 4 Scammell Pioneer
Model SV2S (Acc 1986.2993, E 95.1211)
The development of the Pioneer is covered in the section on tank transporter tractors, and the
early development of the breakdown tractor is covered earlier in this section. When a simpler
crane was needed for the Scammell, a fixed angled single jib crane was designed by John Morris
Ltd, with a sliding section which enabled it to be extended to give a greater lifting height. The
extension was a simple matter of winding a handle and then locking the extension piece into
position. The remaining 1600 or so Pioneer breakdown tractors used this system, with a manual
winch to raise the load on the jib. This was low geared, enabling a man to raise the 3 ton
maximum weight the jib could bear at its shortest extension.
