TRANSLATION into ENGLISH.
Fountain of joy to the certainty of a natión!
We find ourselves here again on the naturally rich plain, the Belgian soil
offering examples of civil and religious art, in extraordinary abundance
and variety.
Because of this variety of vegetation, the sunshine,
and in the sama light the country appeared very sad, that you should

Those who know their tastes, find trips to their satisfaction.
Do you like rivers? Here to name only the main ones, the wild l'Ourthe
Famous GilEppe lake,
cheap tues bles holding it win rusteries, the dadare ep inks,
the Semais with fantastic scenery, and the capricious larche.
