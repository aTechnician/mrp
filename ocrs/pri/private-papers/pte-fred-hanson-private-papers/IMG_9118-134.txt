World War 2 Diary and Memoirs
PHOTOGRAPHIC
COMPETITION
• By Steve Barrett
entries
for
competition
announ-
ced in
the last
"Flakmag'"
were all
of
fairly high standard, although
the
prize - winning
photo-
graphs,
which were easily
the best of those submitted,
were not
particularly good
pictorially; technically, howe-
ver, they were quite sound.
For the benefit of future
competitors, we have decided
to criticize the two
winning
photographs
(reproduced on
pages 47 and 48 respectively),
and we hope that the winners
will not think ill of us for
such public criticism.
The Village Church
mitted by Ple Simmons,
Clerks' Coy). Cover up balf
of the foreground of the
picture, say as far as the
line of water - doesn't it
look a much more balanced
picture now? The print is
rather too dark and would
* benefit by treatment in a
Homestead (submitted by B
epl Fox, Clerks' Coy). This
but ory pletin pature,
building on the right is a
little. too obtrusive?
suggest that with
such a
subject a better idea would
have
been to
have the
smaller house as the centre
of interest with the path
leading one's eye to it -
you agree?.
Since the announcement of
this competition I have been
approached by quite a large
number of interested people,
it has been suggested
that we form a Photographic
Society in the Brigade.
think this is an excellent idea,
and I shall be very pleased
to help in every way possible.
Ii people who are interested
will let me have their names
I will arrange an evening and
place at which the
can be fully discussed (Capt
Wheeled Coy).
The activities of the Society
will at first be rather limited,
but I feel that with the
enthusiasts it will soon rival
the achievements of the So-
cieties back in England (pre-
war, of course).
The subject for the next
competition is "PORTRAIT"
For the benefit of new-
comers to the Brigade, the
rules for these competitions
are as follows:
