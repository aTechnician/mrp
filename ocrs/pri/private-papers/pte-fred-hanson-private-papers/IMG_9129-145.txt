When Scammells were required to lift to a greater height than the jib could manage various
expedients were adopted. One method being, to park the Scammell on a tank transporter trailer,
another was to pile up railway sleepers or gun planks and reverse the vehicle up this slope. Such
methods had to be adopted when no proper workshop crane was available.
Among much equipment provided for the Scammell Pioneer was a pair of tracks. These could be
fitted over each set of rear wheels, effectively converting the vehicle into an half track. These
tracks gave greater traction on soft mud, snow and some other surfaces but were not easy to fit
or remove and only used in extreme conditions. An open crate-like locker under the drivers cab
was designed to carry these tracks.
The diesel engined Scammell Pioneer was due to be replaced by the post-war Scammell
Explorer but a few Pioneers lasted almost as long as the Explorers. The last Pioneer to remain in
active Army service was in Belize where it was still used into the 1980s before eventually being
returned to the UK for the Museum. Arriving in a heap of parts it was rebuilt by the then 43 District
Workshop REME at Aldershot. The vehicle still carries its Belize name 'Swampy'.
The Museum's second Pioneer SV2S was donated by the Museum of Army Transport and differs
from the previous entry only in its colour and markings, being shown in desert sand camouflage.
