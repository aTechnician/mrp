where we hoped the navy
would be able to take us
aboard. We packed into the
lorries in balches of thirly.
Two men in each lorry kept
wary eyes on the sky.
the road was frequently and
heavily strafed we moved off
independently,
hugging
the
edges of woods which lined
the roads and dashing at
Lop
speed across the open
patches. The smouldering or
still blazing wrecks of lorries
lay in the road side; again
my party was fortunate for
the only
enemy
plane
spotted flew disdainfully past.
In the outskirts of Argos, we
were cheered by the sight of
three Hurricanes sitting on
a landing strip on the right
of the
road.
We did not
know they
were all out of
action.
The next day from
the hills surrounding Argos
we saw that air strip ob-
literated by a few unopposed
Italian Bombers.
Late
afternoon we de-
bussed at Argos.
The Au-
stralians drained the oil from
• the engines of the lorries,
a smashed the radiators and
/ placed rocks on the accele-
*, rator pedals to keep
the
engines racing until pistons
seized in the cylinders.
I gathered my small party
of clerks
together
and we
moved off into the hills to
take shelter among the rocks.
From a hill top I could see the
small harbour of Nayplion.
In the bay
an ammunition
ship burned furiously. During
the following alternoon the
fire reached a store of nitro
glycerine-which
exploded:
after the smoke had subsided
there
was no ship
to - be
seen.
After selecting a camp site
among the rocks I sent out
a foraging party which retur-
ned with tins of bully beet,
biscuits,
milk and a
few
pounds of tea and sugar. We
al once began to make some
hot tea before the night set
One man stood by with
a blanket to smother the fire
should any aircraft be spotted
by look outs further up the
hill.
The tea
was brewed
only just in time as a party
of "bomb happy" Australians
above us who had objected
to a fire being
lit at all,
opened fire on us with rifles
and tommy guns. Fortunately
they concentrated their shots
in the fire place itself and
though some of us were
injured by rock splinters no
one was killed or seriously
wounded. I went across to
the
Australians and asked
them to share the tea. They
did so, and apologised for
their previous hostility.
At night we smeared anti--
mosquito cream on our faces
and hands. It was bitterly
cold
and the
mosquitos
attacked us in lordes:
Few
of us I think enjoyed more
than a fitful dove.
