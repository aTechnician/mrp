World War 2 Diary and Memoirs
The Men Who Sailed The Liberty Ships
Oakland Filmmaker pays tribute to the
forgotten men of WWIl
"A Floating Coffin, that's what we called
her. If we took a direct hit in the engine
room, nobody was going to get out alive.
Hell, we didn't even hang life jackets down
there. Why bother."
-Bill Bailey, retired Merchant Marine
The service of America's Merchant Marine sailors earned the praise of President
Eisenhower and General Douglas MacArthur. But when the seamen retured home,
Congress denied them benefits for injuries and society overlooked them in victory
celebrations. The Men Who Sailed The Liberty Ships, a new public TV KTEH
collaboration with Oakland Independent Producer Maria Brooks, pays homage to these
forgotten WWIl sailors. The stirring 60-minute documentary premiered Monday, June 6,
1994 at 8 p.m. in honor of the 50th anniversary of D-Day
on public TV KTEH.
The Men Who Sailed The Liberty Ships was videotaped
in San Francisco aboard the Jeremiah O'Brien, one of the
last remaining WWII Liberty Ships still afloat which sailed
back to Normandy this past April for D-Day
commemorations. The documentary provides a vivid first-
hand account of what it was like sailing these prefabricated
ships--many built in San Francisco, Oakland and
Richmond shipyards.
"This ship is our heritage," explains Bill Bailey, a retired Merchant Marine sailor now
living in San Francisco. "She represents the goodness in our nation. She's what we have
left to show the young people what America can do."
Bailey is one of 13 former merchant sailors profiled in The Men Who Sailed The
Liberty Ships. Their personal stories of war at sea are intertwined with personal
photographs and archival film footage, recreating the unyielding team spirit of America's
Merchant Marine seamen.
