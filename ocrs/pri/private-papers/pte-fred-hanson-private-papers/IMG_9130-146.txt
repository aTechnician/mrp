The pre-war RAOC machinery trucks were allocated letters of the alphabet as a code for each
specific type. This system continued into the 1960s. The type M was a general engineering
workshop with a lathe, grinder, pillar drill and miscellaneous hand tools. Most carried gas welding
equipment. Some were self contained with a small generator to produce current for the machinery
but others depended on an external power source.
Most machinery trucks of the pre-war and World War 2 era had been built on the fairly standard 3
ton 6 x 4 chassis provided by Leyland, Thornycroft, Albion and others. Midway through World
War 2, these vehicles were no longer in production, or were not available in sufficient quantity
and machinery bodies had been designed to fit the shorter 4 x4 chassis then in production.
The most common war time type M machinery trucks to survive were those on the Ford WOT 6
chassis but the Museum's is built on the Bedford QL chassis. An attempt was made to
standardise the types of truck used during the Korean War (1950-1953) when some transfers of
bodies onto Bedford chassis took place. The Museum's may be one of these.
The standard Bedford 3 ton 4 x 4 chassis carries a timber body with drop down sides which form
ground level benches. A rear drop down door carries steps. The machinery layout is as described
above but this vehicle has a small generator.
The machinery type M body on various surviving chassis was eventually supplanted by the Truck
3 ton 4 x 4 MT Repair Bedford RL. Some smaller REME units were allocated machinery trailers
