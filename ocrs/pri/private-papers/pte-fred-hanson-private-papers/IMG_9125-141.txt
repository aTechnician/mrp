Tractor Heavy Breakdown 6 x 4 Scammell Pioneer
Model SV1S (Acc 1965.675)
The development of the Pioneer is covered in the section on the tank transporter tractor.
Following the success of the original tank transporter the Pioneer chassis was selected as the
basis for a series of heavy artillery tractors. In the 1930s, virtually all military trucks and most
tanks used petrol engines. The high torque at low speeds which characterised diesel engines
made them a good power source for towing vehicles and most of the subsequent Pioneers were
fitted with Gardner diesel engines. Speed was not a consideration as the guns available then
were modernised World War 1 types fitted with pneumatic tyred wheels, so high speed towing
was not possible.
The two main types were the 60 pounder gun (le firing a 60 pound shell) and the 6 inch howitzer
firing a shell of that calibre. Howitzers were short barrelled guns designed to fire at relatively short
ranges but at high angles so that shells could be landed vertically, clearing hills or other
obstructions. Guns were fired at high velocities to greater a distance but with a shallower flight
path for the shell. This made long range guns less suitable for hilly areas.
To move guns across rough ground where it was not possible to tow them, the tractor was fitted
with a chassis winch. This chassis was therefore eminently suitable for use as a recovery vehicle,
or breakdown tractor, to use the then current terminology. The breakdown tractor was put into
production in 1939 a year or so after the gun tractor. The first 43 breakdown tractors, designated
SV1S or SV1T, were fitted with folding cranes which, when not being used to lift a vehicle, folded
