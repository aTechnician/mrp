Keeping the Allied Forces supplied with food, fuel and raw
materials, these volunteer civilian sailors endured some of the
highest casualty rates of the war. As civilians, they performed one of
the war's most dangerous jobs. But upon returing home, they were
overlooked in victory celebrations. No medals, no G.L Bills, not
even federal cemetery plots were offered to these men who helped
America succeed in its wartime effort.
