down into the central well of the body. This was a method of reducing the height of the vehicle for
carriage on trains or transportation overseas. One at least of the very early Pioneers was fitted
with a canvas topped driver's cab. When the all steel cab was introduced, the height of the
vehicle remained about the same, as the main jib of the folding crane did not lie completely
horizontal. The mechanism for folding and unfolding the crane was complex and the operation
time consuming, to run with the jib in the raised position resulted in an unwieldy vehicle. For these
reasons a simpler jib was introduced in the design of the later breakdown tractors, designated
Sv2S.
The SV1S vehicle's body consisted of parallel lockers, a full length one on the right and two
shorter ones on the left, divided by the access space to the well and jib winch controls. A drop
down side door filled the space and was fitted with steps. The hand operated jib winch was
located behind the vehicle's cab at the forward end of the body.
The lockers carried recovery gear, and towing bars were usually stowed on the top of the right
hand locker. Early versions sometimes carried a towing ambulance, a long pole with towing eye
at one end and a cross piece at the other to which small wheels could be fitted. These devices
could support the front end weight of small vehicles when on tow.
