FOREWORD
THIS SHOPT HISTORY of our Company is dedicated,
if so lofty a tern can be applied to
so humble
on behalf of all of us,
to our loved
Europe
in their imagination and in their thoughts.
This cannot be complete,
for every man in his
own way will have his on story to tell, nany of
which will be far more interesting and exciting
than anything that is contained in these pages.
But this effort has been made to present an
over-all picture of the Company and of the
events which were the common experience of us
all.
That is is written with an HQ bias is as
regrettable as it is inevitable,
but every attempt
has been made to make this as representative as
possible.
It is hoped that everything that is written
herein will be read in the sane spirit as that
in which it was written, one of "bon comraderie"
for it is difficult to chronicle events of this
nature without leavening them with one or two
more personal references.
These months we have spent on the Continent
of aurope have witnessed the climacteric of our
struggle as a member of the United Nations
against the Nazi tyranny.
In this great victory
it hat i it division an thi, on in,
appreciation of this it was considered worth while
to record, if only for our on satisfaction,
the
main events in our journey from Norandy to Germany.
PMB.
