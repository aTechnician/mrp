Finally the last monument was to record a tragic
accident that overtook 284 Squadron in Holland on
20th October 1944. This squadron at the time had a
device called the Conger, it consisted of a long
length of flexible tubing that was stored on a
stripped down Universal Carrier, similar to a Bren
Gun Carrier. In use, the device would be towed by
an AVRE up to the edge of a minefield, and then a
rocket would be used to propel the tube forward
over the minefield. Then an amount of Nitro-Glycerin
would be pumped into the pipe from storage tanks in
the carrier. It was during the handling of some tons
of Nitro-Glycerin that the explosion occurred; it was
to kill 37 British & Canadian soldiers and destroy 11
AVREs. The memorial was dedicated on the 20th
Oct 1997.
The young girl is the grand-daughter of
Tuynman of Middelburg, Walcheren, who
is a relation of L/Sgt. Rees Barton, (who
died in the explosion), and together with
a local lad from Ijzendijke on 20th, Oct.
1997, unveiled the Monument.
