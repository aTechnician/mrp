It wasn't long before the 79th Armoured Division expanded the armoured content with the specialised
tanks that became a very important adjunct to the task; the success of the Second Front. The
following list gives a better idea of these new tracked vehicles.
AVRE: Churchill tank that became the Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers
CDL: a form of searchlight, mounted on a gun tank Churchill or Grant)
an amphibious tank capable of navigating at sea (Sherman)
Crab: Flail mounted on a Sherman gun tank
Crocodile: Churchill with a Flame-Thrower.
These will be highlighted progressively as the narrative unfolds.
Here I would like to pay my tribute to the boss 'Hobo' who persisted in his determination to change
the whole approach to warfare to give greater protection to the most vulnerable sections of the
Army, the Infantrymen and the Sappers. These both had and would be exposed to high casualty
rates in the type of warfare undertaken up to that time.
