Moving northwards from Brussels we again encountered the Vis, the first
since leaving London.
The enemy had constructed ramps much further
inland and with apparent foresight had aimed them towards Antwerp which
was obviously a good base port for us.
All our supplies were still being
brought all the way form the artificial harbour Mulberry in Normandy.
Although not really bothered by them, the V1s always seemed to be over the
routes which we travelled. Although the Vis had stopped on London, the V2
rockets had continued until we had advanced far enough to put them out of
Not requiring a permanent launching site, as they withdrew they were
redirected on to Antwerp to add to the V1s.
One night in the pitch black we
heard a V1 with its engine cut out gliding over us but couldn't see it and
seconds later there was a blinding flash and bang as it hit the ground close

We now reached a part of the campaign which subsequently became a
subject of great discussion and which concerned the advance into Holland

So it was that we were conversant with the plan to drop

German forces in Holland and isolate a large part of them on the coastal side.
Whilst we were waiting for the 'off our AP was situated behind a large factory
beyond which was a strong pocket of resistance. In the factory behind our
forward units were some detachments of the machine gun regiment which
were firing long range bursts in the direction of the enemy. Our vehicles were
