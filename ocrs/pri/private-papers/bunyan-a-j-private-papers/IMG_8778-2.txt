RECOLLECTIONS OF HALF A SOLDIER (1992)
This has been written as a result of a challenge to record from memory
without reference to any records certain recollections about fifty years ago or
earlier.
They refer to the period of growing up and subsequent interest in the services
in those years up to the start of World War II and the wartime period which
followed.
