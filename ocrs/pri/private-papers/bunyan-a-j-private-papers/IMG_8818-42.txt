Anyone having read this and reached this last page might be excused for
thinking the writer is tattooed all over with the War Department 'logo' which is
an arrow thus:
This is not the case but between 1987 and 1990, as a result of surgery a
vertical straight scar down the centre of the lower abdomen (the result of two
ops for colon removal), flanked by two angled lines on either side at the
bottom (hernias right and left) forming a large arrow, now serves the purpose.
