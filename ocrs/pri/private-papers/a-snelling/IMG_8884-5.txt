ZORBHORD
THTS SHOTE HISTORY Of OUr Contany
is dedioated,
is so lofty a berm con
be
applied to so lunble
on behalf of all
to our loved
Hurope in their imagination and in their thoughts.
This cannot ba complete,
for every man in hia
own way will have his orm story
to tell, many of
which will be far more interesting and exciting
than anything
that is contained in these pages.
But this effort has been made to present an
over-all piature of the dormay and of the
events which were the common experience of us
a11.
That 13 is written with an HQ blas is as
regrettable as it is inevitable,
but every attempt
has been mede to male this as representative as
possible.
It is hoped that everything that is wristen
herein will be read in the same spirit as that
in which it was written, one of "bon comraderie"
for it is airfioult to chronicle events of this
nature without leavening then with one or two
more personal references.
These months we have spent on the Continent
of zurope have withessed the climacterid of our
struggle as a member of the United Nations
against the vazi tyranny.
that has been ton, our Division and therefore
ourselves, have played an integral part, and in
approciation of this it was considered worth while
to record, il only for our on satisfaction, the
main events in our journey fron iommandy to Germany.
