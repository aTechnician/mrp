In The Line
In December, 1944, the Company con-
tribuled its quota of Iwo officers and
36 ORs to the Divisional RASC con-
lingent for the Services Infantry Bal-
talion and served for three weeks in
the line at Gangell. The infaniry train-
ing, which all RASC personnel had
received in the UK was now put to
good effect.
