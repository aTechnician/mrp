During this perion replenisment fron the IMC at SOIrAl ocourred
each morni is at 0830 hrs, with compo and ISR being drawn on eacin
occasion and also oil each morning the supply point for all mits was held in
the Coy location,
at 0900 hrs.
But wilst conditions within the Coy might have remained fairly quiet at
this time the vehicles attached to 704 Coy were covering a great mileage
and
their drivers were getting little rest.
The journey fron the Divisional area
down to the uK railhead at GENNHE was a long one of approximately 280 miles
over indifferent roads.
Each trip took neerly 2, hours,
so our drivers were
more or less living on the job.
The result was that drivers and vehicles had
to be changed fruguently. So it was that whilst six three-tonners returned fron
70i, Cos on 27th, nile were sent back there on the following dey.
At this tia,
however, the route was altered and leave personnel for the uk were travelling
via OSHABNUCK.
We heard too,
that the railway was being extended fron GENEr
to UNSTER and possibly later to OSNABRUCK.
That would be a welcome innovation
since leave personnel were now leaving the unit four days prior to their sailing
date,
and that coupled with the increased leave allotments now being received,
was placing an appreciablo strain on unit man-power. Not that anyone would
have dreaned of complaining of that for the cause was of the best.
During the afternoon of 28th the Coy moved out fron WESTERVESHDE and travelled
North for about 20 miles to the new location recced two days previously at
GR. MECKEISEN.
This was, as usual, a small village consisting of scatterod
farms, and the Coy layout was very much the sane as countloss others in Germany,
