Sir,
I am commanded by the Army Council to inform
you that with a view to affording means of readily identi-
fying officers holding commissions in a national emergency,
it has been
decided to introduce a system of personal
numbers for such officers.
Whilst it is not intended that
such personal numbers shall be used except during a national
emergency, I am to take this opportunity of informing you
that you have been allotted a personal number as above
and to request that should such an emergency arise, you
will quote it in brackets immediately after your name in
all official correspondence pertaining to your military service.
I am, Sir,
Your Obedient Servant,
To :
2/Lt. C.G. Russell,
R. A.S.C. (T. A.)
