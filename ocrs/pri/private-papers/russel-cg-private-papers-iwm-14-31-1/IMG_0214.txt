TO ALL MEMBERS
OF 21 ARMY GROUP
1. I have been considering the present orders about
non-fraternisation.
We cannot let-up on this policy.
But these orders need no longer apply to small
children.
3. Members of the British Forces in Germany will
be allowed to speak to, and play with, little children.
This will come into eflect at once. In all other respects
the orders issued by me in the card dated March 1945
will remain in force.
