EN.S.A. ENTERTAINMENTS FOR
1. FORCES
TO ALL OFFICERS AND MEN
OF 21 ARMY GROUP
1. Twenty-seven
years
ago the Allies occupied
Germany: but Germany has been at war ever since.
Our Army took no revenge in 1918; it was more than
considerate, and before a
few weeks had passed many
soldiers were adopted into German households.
The
enemy worked hard at being amiable.
They believed
that the occupation
was due to treachery,
and that
their army had never been beaten.
They remained unre-
pentant and attached to their worship of brute force.
2. The fight was continued by the German General
Staff, who concealed war criminals and equipments,
built up armaments, and trained a new striking force.
To evade the
Armistice terms they had to find sym-
pathisers,
and
"organising
sympathy"
became
German industry.
So accommodating were the occupy-
ing forces that the Germans came to believe we would
never
fight them again in
any cause.
From that
moment to this their continued aggression has brought
misery or death to millions, always under the familiar
smoke screen of appeals for fair play and friendship,
followed by the barrage of stark,
brutal threats.
This time the Nazis have added to the experience of
the last occupation; they have learned from the resist-
ance movements of France, Belgium,
Holland, and
Norway.
These are the type of instructions they are
likely
to give to their underground workers:

3. Because of these facts, I want every soldier to be
clear about "non-fraternisation".
Peace does not exist
merely
because of a surrender.
The Nazi
influence
penetrates everywhere, even into children's schools and
churches. Our occupation of Germany is an act of war
of which the first object is to destroy the Nazi system.
There are Allied
organisations
whose work it is to
single out, separate and destroy the dangerous elements
in German life.
It is too soon for you to distinguish
between "good" and "bad" Germans: you have a posi-
tive part to play in winning the peace by a definite
code of behaviour.
In streets, houses, cafes, cinemas,
etc.,
you must keep clear of Germans, man, woman
and child, unless you meet them in the course of duty.
You must not walk out with them, or shake hands, or
visit their homes, or make them gifts, or take
gifts
from them.
You must not play games with them or
share any social event with them.
In short, you must
not fraternise with Germans at all.
4. To
refrain from fraternisation is not easy.
It
requires self-discipline.
But in Germany you will have
to remember that
laughing and eating
and dancing
with Germans would be bitterly resented by your own
families, by millions of people who have suffered under
the Gestapo and under the Luftwaffe's bombs, and by
every Ally that Britain possesses.
You will have to
remember that these are
the same Germans who, a
short
while ago, were drunk with victory, who were
boasting what they as the Master Race
