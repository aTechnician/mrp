THE
EVACUATION
OF
THE
ALLIED
ARMIES FROM DUNKIRK AND
NEIGHBOURING BEACHES.
The following despatch was submitted to the
Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty
the 18th
June, I940,
Bertram H. Ramsay,
by
Vice-Admiral Sir
K.C.B., M.V.O., Flag
Officer Commanding, Dover.
Office of
The Flag Officer
Commanding,
Dover.
I8th June, I940:
Be
pleased to lay before Their Lordships
the following report on Operation
' Dynamo
namely the
evacuation of the Allied Armies
from
Dunkirk
and
neighbouring
beaches
between 26th May and 4th June, 1940.
The
report takes the
form of this covering letter,
together with detailed narrative and appendices.
2. THE POLICY AND THE PROGRESS OF THE
EVACUATION.
During the
course of the operation
330,000 troops* reached safety in England after
being evacuated from Dunkirk, and from the
beach
stretching Io miles eastward from
the
entrance to Dunkirk Harbour
To those on the
French coast,
when in the early stages any-
thing
up
to 50,000 troops
were waiting
embark on a 10 mile
sea front,
the presence
of perhaps
20 small warships off shore,
and
200 small boats spread along the length of coast
at any given moment, must have appeared as
a feeble effort to tackle this great task.
Further-
more, it was impossible to adjust the arrival of
ships, either at Dunkirk or opposite the beaches,
• Admiralty footnote: About one-quarter
of these
troops were carried in ships manned by the Merchant
Navy•
to synchronise with the ebb
and flow of the
troop concentrations.
Broadly speaking, for the first 5 days of the
movement, had more beaching craft been avail-
able to ferry from the beach to offshore vessels,
it would have been possible to have evacuated
a greater number.
For the last 3 to 4 days,
the main
the
B. ere had already been evacuated, the rate of
lifting was governed by the availability of the
troops during the limited hours evacuation was
possible.
3. Throughout the operation one of the
greatest difficulties was the ever changing situa-
tion presented.
Within 24 hours of the start,
the operation took the shape of a forlorn hope
to rescue the maximum
number,
say up
to
45,000 before the whole force was to be over-
whelmed by the enemy.
Next, the
military
situation became more
stable, and it appeared that some three to four
days would be
available to complete evacua-
Don of the BE.., estimated at me 175,00.
During
evacuation
resources of French troops was introduced,
some 25,000 being mentioned.
During the course of the fifth day (3oth May)
tentative decision to
lift
the rearguard of
the B.E.F. off the beaches at a definite time,
viz. 0130 on Ist June, was reached.
Twenty-
four hours later this plan was altered by military
considerations,
involving an extension of the
period of evacuation
At the
same time, the
Vaval authority
was definitely
committed to
provide for the evacuation of French forces,
hen mentioned as about 40,000 / 50,000.
Later, the French number rose and 150,000
or more was quoted.
Finally no agreement
could be reached with the French as to an,
termination of the operation which threatened
