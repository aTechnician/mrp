Dear Mr Russell
Very many thanks
for your letter of 4 February
and
for its most interesting enclosures.
frequently do follow-up notes to stories
that have appeared in Peterborough,
not recall a previous example of a
38-year delay
between original and successor! We will see
we can do, but as
sure you will apprec-
iate, time is not of the essence on this story.
Thank you,
too, for your very kind words about
the column: they are much appreciated.
With our good wishes.
Yours sincere-s
John Coldstream
