	title = {War of Supply: World War {II} Allied Logistics in the Mediterranean},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv2g7v1b0},
	shorttitle = {War of Supply},
	abstract = {The era of modern warfare introduced in World War {II} presented the Allied Powers with one of the more complicated logistical
challenges of the century: how to develop an extensive support
network that could supply and maintain a vast military force
comprised of multiple services and many different nations thousands of miles away from their home ports. The need to keep tanks
rolling, airplanes flying, and food and aid in continuous supply
was paramount to defeating the Nazi regime.

In this extensively researched book, David Dworak takes readers
behind the scenes and breaks down the nuances of strategic
operations for each of the great Mediterranean military campaigns between 1942 and the conclusion of World War {II} on May 8, 1945.
Dworak gives readers a glimpse behind the curtain, to show how the vast administrative bureaucracy developed by the Allies waged a
literal "war of matériel" that gave them a distinct, strategic
advantage over the Axis powers. From North Africa to Southern
France, their continued efforts and innovation developed the
framework that helped create and maintain the theater of war and, ultimately, paved the path to victory.},

	abstract = {"A Great Feat of Improvisation redresses the long-standing lacuna in the historiography of the {BEF}: logistics. Wide ranging in reach, comprehensive in scope and meticulously researched, it lucidly demonstrates, through description and analysis, not only the importance of logistics to military operations during the campaign but provides fresh evidence and analysis on the deployment sustainment, operations and evacuation of the {BEF} in the period 1939-1940. A Great Feat of Improvisation examines how pre-war strategic, economic, political and defence dynamics influenced the plans to generate and deploy the {BEF}, before assessing how the logistics challenges were met. Many aspects of the {BEF}'s logistic operations are described and analysed, including the development of the {BEF}'s Wheeled Motor Transport capability, the establishment and expansion of the Base, the role of military and commercial railways tot he {BEF}'s capability and the organization and capability of logistics at divisional level. The {BEF}'s ammunition, supply and fuel distribution systems, together with the delivery of equipment spares, recovery and repairs, are examined in addition to the logistics under-pinning the {BEF}'s growing offensive Gas Warfare capability. Logistic support to the 1st Armoured Division is described from the division's formation to its evacuation from France, whilst the logistic aspects of denial and recovery operations are explored. Also assessed is the planning and delivery of the 'Quartering' requirement within the United Kingdom for the returning units of the {BEF} and support to the Soldier in France."--Page 4 of cover.},

He also explores the continuous German adaptation that prolonged the war and increased the price of eventual Allied victory. Central to his comparative study is the complex interplay of personalities, military culture, and wartime realities that determined how accurately the combatants learned the lessons of war, and how effectively they enhanced their battle capabilities."--{BOOK} {JACKET}.},

	abstract = {The invasion of Europe in 1944 and the victories that followed would not have been possible without the massive naval operation known as Neptune. Symonds traces the central thread of this Olympian event -- involving over five thousand ships and nearly half a million personnel -- from the first talks between British and American officials in the winter of 1941 to the storming of the beaches in the late spring of 1944. Neptune was the pinnacle of Allied organization and cooperation ; "On June 6, 1944, 160,000 Allied troops landed along 50 miles of French coastline to battle German forces on the beaches of Normandy. D-Day, as it would come to be known, would eventually lead to the liberation of Western Europe, and was a critical step in the road to victory in World War {II}. Yet the story begins long before the Higgins landing craft opened their doors and men spilled out onto the beaches to face a storm of German bullets. The invasion, and the victories that followed, would not have been possible without the massive naval operation that led up to it: {NEPTUNE}. From the moment British forces evacuated the beaches of Dunkirk in 1940, Allied planners began to consider how, when, and where they would re-enter the European continent. Once in the war, the Americans, led by George Marshall, wanted to invade in a year's time. The British were convinced this would be a tragic mistake. Allied forces would be decimated by the Wehrmacht. When Operation Overlord -- the name given to the cross-Channel invasion of Northern France -- was finally planned, it was done so only in concert with the seaborne assault that would bring the men and equipment to the Normandy coast. Symonds traces the central thread of this Olympian event -- involving over five thousand ships and nearly half a million personnel -- from the first talks between British and American officials in the winter of 1941 to the storming of the beaches in the late spring of 1944. He considers Neptune's various components, including the strategic unity, industrial productivity, organizational execution, and cross-cultural exchange on which the Allies depended. Portraits of key American and British figures, from Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Eisenhower to Admiral Ernest J. King and his British counterpart, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, combine with an intimate look at men up and down the chain of command. Neptune was the pinnacle of Allied organization and cooperation. From the suppressing of the U-boat menace in the Battle of the Atlantic, to the establishing of camps and training facilities near the English coast, to the gearing up of the American industrial machine to produce the ships, tanks, and tools of war that would make an invasion possible, Symonds' riveting narrative uncovers the means by which Neptune was brought to fruition, and presents the first comprehensive account of the greatest naval operation in history"},
