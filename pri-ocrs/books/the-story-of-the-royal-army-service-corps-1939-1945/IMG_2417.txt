The Work of the Men in the AATO
This short statement of the RASC/RIASC air effort in SEAG
can scarcely do justice to the work of thousands of officers and
men, British and Indian, who worked without respite to perfect
and to operate this splendid service.
As in Europe, the highest
levels were staff controlled.
The actual air despatch crews were
in many cases 'unskilled' infantry soldiers (mainly Gurkhas) attached
to the air despatch companies, for so great was the extent of the
service that almost all the 10,000 trained RIASC men were required
for the expert jobs of packing and stowing the airborne loads.
recognition should be given to the sterling work of these 'infantry
attached'.
The landing of supplies in the case of supply by air was fraught
with great difficulties because of the rugged nature of the terrain
and the limitation in the size of air strips and their approaches.
Their troubles were not over when they had unloaded.
It was
often a question of whether the aircraft could get off the ground
and make sufficient height for manoeuvre before coming up against
the mountain mass which usually bounded the strip.

crews!)

and always seemed
to gain its height in the nick of time.
Monsoon conditions, too,
imposed added difficulties and dangers, with low cloud, unpredict-

Had the Japanese had the material for and the skill in
anti-aircraft defence of the Germans, the tale of losses would have
been a heavy one indeed.
Air Despatch in SWPA
Finally, it is appropriate that the efforts of the Royal Australian
Air Force and the Royal Australian Army Service Corps in air
supply in New Guinea should be mentioned.
