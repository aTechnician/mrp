THE R.A.S.G. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
and this was in the War Office itself, where five different branches
were dealing with the various matters affecting barrack services.
In 1938 a review had been made by a War Office committee, which
had recommended the appointment to the War Office of a senior
and experienced barrack officer to advise the various branches on
matters of policy, and to effect some co-ordination.
The actual
responsibilities, however, were still to be left divided among the
same five branches.
The organization beneath the War Office level at that time
provided no direct departmental channel for the functional control of
the barrack services.
The only officer directly related to the Barrack
Department, above the level of the officers in charge of barracks, was
a retired officer of the rank of licutenant-colonel at each command
headquarters, who was called a command barrack officer.
He was
neither a staff officer nor the head of a service and could imue no
directions or instructions except through the medium of the Q stall,
The first wartime change in the organization occurred in 1942,
when an area barrack officer of the rank of major was added to
the establishment of each RASC district or area.
At the same
time it was decided that, because of the large increase in the number
of troops located at home, and the consequent expansion of the
RASC establishments for the administration of supply,
transport
and barrack vervices, it had become impracticable for the Inspector
HASC to give the barrack services the full and detailed attention
that they required, and the appointment of an
Inspector
Barrack Services at the War Office was approved.
Lieut Colonel
H, M. Wright aurned this appointment on January 1ath, 1942,
After his early inspection visits, and his review and examination of
the barrack services in the United Kingdom, he made recommenda
thens that eventually resulted in a further reorganization being
approved, and this came into effect in the following, year

The rapid formation of ADGB units in 1939, followed by the larg
expansion in the United Kingdom on general mobilization, made
heavy demands on the barrack services.
The initial equipping
of accommodation entails the most work, and in this respect the
greatest demand came at a time when the Barrack Department
was losing many of its most experienced officers, who were needed
to fill quartermaster appointments in field force units.

half civilian, lost many of the military clerks, mostly warrant officers
and NCOs, who were withdrawn
for field force duties. New
barrack charges, as the areas administered by officers in charge of
barracks are termed, had to be formed, and the number of officers
in charge of barracks rose quickly from 40 to more than 100 by 1941.
Vor the newly formed barrack charges, and for the expansion of
the staffs of the existing charges, the manpower needs were difficult
to meet.
Accountants were particularly scarce,
These barrack
accountants, or barrack wardens as they were at that time called,
are key men in the barrack services,
for they handle all the
indenting, iwing and accounting in connection with all forms
of furnishings, table ware, bedding and linen, and with fuel and
light,
They are normally appointed from
among pensioned
warrant officers and NCOs, who have invaluable knowledge and
experience of the ins and outs of army ways, and have the sense
i responsibility and quality of resourcefulness that go with such
experience,
It is typical of most of these accountants that they
take considerable pride in the arrangement and layout of the
stores which they hold as maintenance stocks,
