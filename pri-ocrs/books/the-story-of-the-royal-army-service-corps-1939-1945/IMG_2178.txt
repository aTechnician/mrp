occupation of the airfields.

dislodge the enemy followed;
but in spru
ey were ineffective, and it was
necessary to turn to counter-invasion instead.
By now, however, such action was not easy.
News from Norway
was scanty, confused and unreliable; there was some disagreement
between the French and ourselves about the relative importance of
different objectives; many of the troops who had been prepared to
sail before the
German coup had been disembarked; and in any
case this force was equipped to land without resistance in friendly
ports.
In
the event, two regular and two newly-formed Territorial
British brigades were available (though one never landed), while
the French contributed a considerable mixed force, not all well-
trained, which we need not detail here.
The objectives finally selected were:-Narvik, and the railway
thence to Sweden; Namsos, on a fjord some 80 miles north of
Trondhjem, and Andalsnes, similarly placed 110 miles south of
Trondhjem.
The two last named places were selected as suitable
entries for the encirclement of Trondhjem, by now thought too
strong for a frontal assault; while Andalsnes also afforded a means
of preventing the movement of the Germans northwards from their
main bases in southern Norway, to interfere with our operations.
A surprising number of code-names were employed to describe
the various Norwegian operations and the forces engaged in them.
For the present account, only a few need be known, and they are
perhaps best simplified as follows: the operations at Narvik, at the
time they actually began, were known by the code-name
'Avon-
mouth', and the force engaged was Avonforce.
All other operations
at about the same
time,
elsewhere in Norway, had the generic
name of 'Rupert'.
The two principal forces engaged in 'Rupert'
were Mauriceforce at Namsos, north of Trondhjem, under Major-
General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, and Sickleforce at Andalsnes,
south of Trondhjem, under command of Major-General B. C. T.
Paget.
After the failure of operations at the two last named places.
and the evacuation of Mauriceforce and Sickleforce, the troops at
Narvik ceased to be called Avonforce, and succeeded instead to the
name Rupertforce.
From the RASC point of view,
few details
are available of the Namsos operation, but it was similar to that at
Andalsnes.
This account will therefore discuss Narvik first,
conclude with the forces based on Andalsnes.
Headquarters 49 (West Riding) Division, commanded by Major-
General P. T. Mackesy, was modified to form HQ Avonforce, which
was charged with the recapture of Narvik.
Under command were
