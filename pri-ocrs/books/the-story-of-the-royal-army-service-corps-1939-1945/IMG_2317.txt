BURMA AND CEYLON
had managed to move a large part of the stocks across the river,
and so ensured the supply of rations during the final withdrawal.
This began
with a race for the
Chindwin crossing at Kalewa,
7th Armoured Brigade covering the retreat.
The RASC convoys
were often ambushed, fortunately without loss, and the company
took part in a sharp action against an enemy force trying to cut off
the rearguard.
On arrival at the Chindwin,
the order was given
to destroy vehicles and equipment, as there was no means of ferrying
them over.
All the second line lorries were still under load, some
carrying as much as five tons of petrol and oil.
The company had
kept the brigade supplied with its requirements throughout.
The last place in the order of march was given to 65 Company,
which therefore had to act as a rearguard, with some untrained
Gurkhas attached; but when night came, contact with the enemy
was lost.
The last of Burma Army crossed into India early in May,
1942, where HQIV Corps was doing the best it could to help with
limited resources and in very difficult conditions.
Problems on the Lines of Communication
The chief trouble was the lack of proper communications.
From
the railway at Dimapur, or Manipur Road, to Imphal, the capital
of Manipur State, a distance of 135 miles, there was a motor road
only wide enough for one-way traffic.

It was a typical Indian
innumerable corners and hairpin bends, a steep slope up on one
road, winding along the jungle-covered hillside with
side, and a precipitous fall on the other.
In the first 46 miles, from
Dimapur to Kohima, it climbed 4,000 feet, reaching its peak of
5,500 feet at Mao, 20 miles farther on.
It then dropped 3,000 feet
in 40 miles to the Imphal Plain, and the last stretch to Imphal
was comparatively flat.
From Imphal to the frontier at Tamu, 65
miles, there had been only a bridle-track, but this had been
improved into an unmetalled fairweather motor road in time to
help the passage of Burma Army.
Cross-country movement for
wheeled traffic was impossible almost everywhere.
The difficulties of the route were increased by the monsoon rains.
These normally break in the middle of May, and the heavy tropical
downpour goes on almost continuously until September, making the
movement of wheeled transport impossible except on the few all-
weather roads.
The monsoon broke on time that year, and this
made the Manipur road even
more hazardous.
Thousands of
labourers were working to convert it into a two-way road, the
method being to cut into the bank on the inner side, carry the earth
across the road, and drop it over the 'khad', or lower slope.
Some
of the soil fell on the road, and became in the rain a greasy menace
on the tarred surface, causing vehicles to skid, often with disastrous
