In the meantime the effort involved in supplying our expeditions
to Norway was not a great one as the amount of M'T spirit was small
and little aviation fuel was used,
MT spirit had to be specially
provided in the form of 68 octane to suit the local climatic con-
ditions and initial shipments were supplied in the standard 4-gallon
tin,
This spirit had a short life of about four months after which
it tended to gum (i,e, to lose its volatility).
Some small bulk tanks
and filling plant were taken over at Harstaad by No. 4 Petrol Depot
and full use was made of them for filling drums and barrels,

was to assist in organizing the wholesale destruction of the main
civil installations in France before they were overrun by the enemy.
The question of denying such important military objectives to an
enemy was not a new one as it had been examined at the beginning
of the war in consultation with the Admiralty, with special reference
to installations in Holland and Belgium, and engineers had been
specially trained in petroleum destruction technique,
ST 2 col-
lected much of the information and photographs
and plans of
installations were acquired by various lawful and, in some cases,
unlawful means,
When the immediate problem in France was raised G8 (Plans)
he War Office branch responsible for the project, formed a smal
inter-service committee as Naval and Air Force activity was also
affected,
The small parties, known as XD parties which were
employed to carry out the demolition plans were on the whole
