THE R.A.B.C, VLEET
Unlike normal formations, the RASC Fleet craft were to operate
off all beaches, and thus the whole plan had to be discloseda
ticklish problem in security, This caused some anxiety
when
D Day was postponed, for the crews of the open launches could not
be confined to their boats indefinitely,
But all was well,
After the arrival of the craft at Yarmouth, the companies passed
entirely under the control of the Royal Naval Headquarters at
Portsmouth, and it should be recorded that no written orders or
instructions were issued for the move to Normandy from start to
finish,
The arrangements for the move were made entirely by
personal liaison, and this worked very satisfactorily,
The Crossing to Normandy
The first motorboat company craft to leave were three harbour
launches of 696 Company which were to carry Sappers for erecting
the Mulberry Harbour,
The main body of the harbour launch company arrived off the
beaches on June gth and sith (D plus g and D plus 5 days), the
latter after a passage lasting some 49 hours, for they were placed in
a slow convoy,
would have sufficient petrol to complete the passage at such a
speed; so launches towed each other alternatively,
HQ CRASC, 30 fast motorboats and six motor fishing vessels of
6aд Company crossed on D Day, June Gth, 1944, Thereafter small
parties of craft from both units left each day,
One of the most outstanding feats of the crossing was that of a
section of eight harbour launches of 6a6 Company, which sailed
under the command of an officer on D plus 11,
by the violent storm which created such havoc on the beaches, and
it is greatly to the credit of the party that seven out of the eight
arrived safely, The eighth had engine trouble and was taken in
tow by a minesweeper whose captain was much impressed by the
crew refusing to abandon their launch,
despatched, this was the only craft that failed to arrive under its
own power,
Work on the Reach-head
Until the port of Mulberry had been constructed, it was not
possible for craft to get nearer than one mile off shore, and so all
Crews had to live on their launches and MVVs.
This was most
arduous, especially for the harbour launch erews in their open boats,
Eventually, however, they were accommodated in the unsubmerged
portion of one of the sunken block ships around Mulberry,
With the exception of certain smaller vesels which were able to
enter Mulberry, shipping lay some three miles off shore,
The fast

launch company was used in the control of this and to maintain
contact between the dukw companies and the ships to be unloaded.
Certain of the 48 ft launches were allotted permanently to the Port
Commander and other senior officers, but perhaps the most important
was the fast launch Barham.
She was allotted for the personal use
of Admiral Sir Rivett Carnac, Flag Officer, British Naval Assault
Forces.
It is of interest to recall that when he inspected the craft at
Westminster Steps before D Day the Admiral was much impressed,
but he cast an eye of some disapproval at the blue ensign
with
crossed swords.
Not unnaturally, he wanted the white ensign to
be flown,
However, his request was gently but firmly refused, and
thus it was that the Admiral's FMB went to sea flying the ensign
of the RASC Fleet!
This craft was for a time under constant fire
off Courseilles and often taken out in conditions that would normally
be considered quite unsuitable for launches of this type,
After the
operation, Admiral Carnac paid us the compliment of borrowing
the RASC crew to instruct his naval crew in FMIB handling.
Casualties to propellers and steering gear were heavy, because of
the considerable flotsam off the beaches.
Without slipways or
cradles, repairs to underwater gear had to be done at sea.
Here
much ingenuity was shown,
On several occasions use was made
of the derricks of merchant ships to lift a launch clear of the water
and repairs to the props and rudders were then effected from a
dinghy,
But this was a hazardous and risky business even in calm
Waters,
The harbour launches had an extremely busy time ferrying men
to and from Phoenixes and ships, towing barrage balloons in the
Mulberry port area, carrying CMP water patrols, serving as tenders
to IWT barges, and being engaged on many other tasks,
Although it may be invidious to give examples of the exploia of
these RASC crews, mention must be made of two or three at least,
KASC, with Cpl K. Popperwell, RASC, as second coxswain, who
earned renown on June igth, 1914, when they battled for five hours
in an appalling gale to rescue i6o gunners marooned on an isolated
caisson.
The newly-fashioned emplacement, swept by enormous
waves, was in constant danger of breaking up,
Harbour Launch No, 476, with Sgt A, In Smith, RASC, an
coxswain,
distinguished herself on June toth and nith, 1oth,
gallant work before being wrecked in a third valiant rescue attempt
t0 days later,
On the first occasion, a motor launch blew up on
a mine while engaged on the demolition of a wreck,
The coxswain
of HIL. 990 immediately
went to the rescue and, in spite of the
warnings of further explosions,
succeeded in saving three lives,
