THE RASC. PLEBE
and only carried a crew of five, permission was requested to return
to base, land the prisoners, get an armed party and return to
secure the E-boat.
This was given, but in the meantime HMS Jade
had put out to take the Feboat in tow.
The active gentleman
waving the flag turned out to be the missing British pilot! The
crew sorely regretted this missed opportunity of towing in a prize.
Not long after returning to base and resuming her air/sea rescue
duties, the Clive received another urgent call to
proceed about
86 miles to the north and take possession of another & boat believed
to be in that vicinity,
The search, conducted without escort of
air cover, took her to a position off Cape
Passarro:
Although
unsuccessful in her primary task, she sighted and closed to investi-
gate, first, an Italian schooner carrying German troops, and a little
later, an Italian hospital ship coming at high speed out of the
Straits of Messina,
'Cloak-and-dagger tasks also fell to the Fleets lot, Later in the
summer of the same year, for instance, the Clive was detailed to
land French agents at Mammamet in Tunisia, involving & run
of about 206 miles each way.
Unfortunately
various troubles
prevented this detail from being completed, and instead of landing
vale and well in North Africa, a very seasick party of Frenchmen
returned to Malta:
The cider Fleet vessels played their part too. On oue memorable
occasion in January, 1g42, the steam target tower Lord Flumer was
returring from the noeth-west of the island with a load of sand for
airfield funways
when she
was attacked by & Messerschmitt
off Tigne Point.
The machine gunner was killed and the chief
engineer (Mr, C, Long) mortally wounded,
The vessel, however,
made port, and for his gallant part in this action with the enety
the master (Mr, B. W, Else, was made & Member of the Order of
the British Empire,
Later the RASCV Lord Flumer proceeded with
a military crew to North Africa, where she remained until the end
of the war,

in this way, and many more
were subsequently destreyed by the
Port Mine Sweeping Officer who quickly came on the scene.
The
work of the RASC Fleet's one and only (unofficial) mine sweat
is laconically recorded thus in an Admiralty letter to the
Office:
"Their Lordships note with interest this occasion of a War Depart

If only space were available, many more such stories could be
told of the RASC vessels in Malta,
Suffice it to say that to them
also fell the unique distinction of target towing for the Royal Navy
and for the American, Free French, Greek, and Yugoslav navies

Although its headquarters were established at White
Man's Bay, Freetown, it was widely dispersed,
There were no
slipways and hardly any local maintenance facilities in any of the
four colonies,
The waters were infested with teredo worm, and
these who have served in the tropies knew how rapid and devastating
the damage it inflicts can be:
The unit also had to compete with
the inexperience of the locally recruited erews, particulady of
engineeri
Teething troubles were many and serious, and yet, as
at example of the way in which the unit tackled the joh, some 19,600
men were carried in seven of its launches in one month aleme
