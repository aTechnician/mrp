THE R.A.S.C, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
they took over more and more of the home transport units and
were merged finally into the mixed transport companies which did
all the hack work in home commands.
The ATS girls in their transport units kept an extremely high
standard of vehicle maintenance, accounted for partly by the un-
paralleled keenness of their first cadre of officers, partly by the happy
fact that they were not interested in games or football pools so that
for lack of off-duty relaxation they put extra time into 'petting"
their precious vehicles, and partly no doubt because of a wholesome
determination to show the men that they 'could do better',
So
important did the work of the ATS for the Corps become on
the transport side, that from
1941 onwards ATS officers were
drafted into ST 3 (the first staff captain was inevitably known as
'Scats') and proved as good there as in their units,
The very fine
services rendered by the ATS on the gun sites of Anti-Aircraft
Command is now history, but their work in our field of 'ST has
not received acknowledgement to the same degree.
The Anti-Aircraft Command
When the Anti-Aircraft Command was formed it was hoped to
keep the establishments small and to dovetail the duties of army
command transport units with the more specialized duties, such as
ammunition carriage, of the AA Command units.
evident, however, that the load on army command units was all
they could support and, moreover, the enormous dispersion and the
inaccessibility of many of the anti-aircraft sites called for an entirely
separate organization of their own.
'Command' grew from
one Regular and two Territorial brigades to no fewer than 13 divisions
organized in eight groups,
The delivery of ammunition, fuel and
bood to these divisions became the sole responsibility of the AA
divisional RASCs,
the work of the whole
co-ordinated by a DDST with a small staff at AA Command
headquarters,
The system of ammunition supply differed slightly from that
adopted for the field armies, and may be described briefly,
ammunition was initially stored in RAOC central ammunition
depots and was distributed by them, usually by means of home
command transport, to intermediate ammunition depots,
these it was carried by RASC transport to emergency ammunition
magazines,
The anti-aircraft divisional RASC normally carried it
from the emergency ammunition magazines to the gun sites,
the Corps responsibility was for keeping both BAMs and gun sites

it all fell goodness only knows, but at least one 3•7-inch shell fell, in
the first daylight raid on London, almost on top of two RASC
lorries at the south-west corner of the War Office,
The lorries
were wrecked and the drivers wounded, while the blast seemed to
take a malignant delight in shattering the windows of the financial
'high ups' in the War Office,
This business of anti-aircraft ammunition supply, complicated as
it was by the multiplicity of types required (40 mm Bofors, 3-inch,
3. 7 inch, 4 5-inch, 5•25-inch and rockets) caused some anxiety at
first, until it was tried, in miniature, in the first raid on the Shetland
Islands,
Everything worked according to plan and, except for
the increased mileages and expenditures of ammunition called for
during the deployment of AA Command units four years later to
meet the Vi attacks, little difference in organization or operation
was found necessary throughout the war,
Animal and Water Transport
To economize in our use of mechanical vehicles and skilled drivers,
horse-drawn wagons were requisitioned, with the necessary animals
and hired civilian drivers, in 1940 and 1941,

During the First World War considerable tactical use had been
made of motorboat companies, ASC, on Lake Doiran in Macedonia
on the Sea of Galilee, and on certain of the lakes in East Africa,
It is not surprising therefore, that at an early stage of the second
war the use of RASC operated boats for supplying outlying forts,
inaccessible except by sea, round our coasts and, later, for supply
inter-communication purposes in certain
threatened areas,
particularly on the south-east coast of Britain, led to the formation
of motor

boat companies, RASC, which were equipped mainly
requisitioned launches.
Eventually two motorboat training
units were raised, and one of them was located at falcombe, in
Devon, and the other at St, Austell, in Cornwall,
