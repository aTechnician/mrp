CHAPTER I
PRELUDE
GENERAL SURVEY
THEN the Second World War broke out in 1929 the
when compared with somether moo seni
but it traced its origin back some 145 years.
It was given the
prefix 'Royal' for the part it played during the war of 1914-18.
The Corps had been able to give tangible proof of the wisdom
underlying its original charter, for if an army were to be successfully
maintained with supplies and transport, the Corps responsible for
those duties must be fully combatant, both officer and man being
trained soldiers as well as masters of their particular administrative
tasks.
The charter implied
that,
even though the
Corps
was
concerned principally with administrative duties, all ranks must be
inculcated with a stronge sense of the regimental spirit,
or what
is perhaps better referred to as esprit de corps.
The second war was
to give even further proof of the wisdom of its original founder.*
When the first history of the Corps came to be published it was
thought appropriate to include some account of its forbears, even
though many of them were short lived and
met with
varying
degrees of success, to be disbanded and then resurrected in different
guise when need arose.
Hence this first history was given the title
'R.A.S.C.-A History of Transport and Supply in the British Army?
It is thought that the now well-founded regimental character of
the Corps can, in relating the record of its work in the Second
World War, be best expressed in the simple title which has been
chosen for this volume.
Days of Retrenchment
The end of the first war brought with it the natural reaction
which follows any period of such national stress-the hope for a
lasting peace.
Peace seemed to be
the object of all nations, and
British defence policy was based on an assumption that no great
war need be expected for a period of Io years.
The primary
training objective of the army was defined as imperial policing.
