SOUTH-EAST ASIA
A scare in July, 1940, when all women and children were evacu-
ated, led to the adoption of many RASC ideas on the arrangements
for the supply and transport services.
The RASC took over all
food stocks from NAAFI,
a full war-time ration was introduced,
reserves were bought for the local forces, and stocks of petrol were
amassed.
Supply stores, petrol dumps, goat stables, a flour mill, a
bakery, and other installations,
were built or improvised in the
country on the east, west and south sides of the island, away from
the vulnerable north.
The headquarters and workshops of 12
Company were also to be located in the south of the island in case
of emergency.
By the middle of 1941, four and a half months'
reserve of supplies was in hand, nearly all the new storehouses had
been erected, the stocks were dispersed, 3,000 goats were in their
stables, and the mill was working.
In the fortnight preceding
the Japanese declaration of war,
tension mounted.
The situation deteriorated to such an extent in
the first days of December that, by
the evening of the 7th, our
troops were ready in their battle positions, and when the opening
attack came, there only remained the mobilization of the local
volunteer forces and final moves of rear parties to their war stations.
The Japanese Attack
The Japanese attack on the mainland began on December 8th,
194I, and soon forced the forward defended localities.
On Decem-
ber gth the enemy began probing attacks on 'Gindrinkers Line", the
main defensive position.
On the night of December 1oth the key
position, Shing Mun redoubt, fell into Japanese hands,
and
the
evacuation of the mainland was ordered on the following
day.
During this period, RASC water transport had been operating at
full scale to evacuate the military hospital from Kowloon and
move NAAFI stores from their mainland godowns to the island.
On the night of December toth the artillery garrison of Stonecuters
Island
was evacuated, and the next afternoon
the
WD vessel
Oudenarde, under continuous shellfire,
delivered a lighter load of
mules to the RASC camber.
These were unloaded under heavy
shellfire by RASC, HKMC and Chinese, the only casualties being
two mules
and
Lieutenant Keeler,
RIASC,
who was
slightly
wounded.
As the RASC camber then became untenable,
it was
evacuated.
Withdrawal from the Mainland
The main evacuation of the mainland proceeded throughout
and vessels
December tith under the direction of the Royal Navy,
were supplied by the Royal Navy, the RASC and the civilian ferry
