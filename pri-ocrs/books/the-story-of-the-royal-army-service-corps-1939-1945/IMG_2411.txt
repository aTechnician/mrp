AIR DESPATCH
The Work of Packers and Air Despatch Crews
The packers had to have a knowledge of the stresses to which the
packages would be put, and had to make up loads which world
conform to certain ruling dimensions.
Yor instance, the completed
package must be able to pas freely down the runway to the exit
door of the aircraft, it must be of a size to pass easily through the
doot, and it must be of such a weight as to fall safely with the
parachute 'life' available to it. The load must be securely and
mmovably fastened to the bottom board of the container in the
case of 'pannier' containers), as any loosenes in the lashings
upset the trim of the parachuted load, cause it to foul other
oote
tainers in the aircraft, or even allow it to disintegrate and do an
unrehearsed 'free drop,
The lashings of containers themselves to
the aircraft must be done with meticulous care, and regard must be
paid to the fact that the craft, bry its acceleration or deceleration,
en falling into and out of air pockets, may endom the object carried
