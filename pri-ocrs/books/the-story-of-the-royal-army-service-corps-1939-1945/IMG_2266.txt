THE CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN
Preliminaries to Invasion-Capture of Pantelleria and Lampedusa
The capture of Pantelleria and Lampedusa
was an
essential
preliminary to the invasion of Sicily.
Although the offensive value
of the islands had been largely destroyed by the capture of Tunisia,
the Italians had set up advanced listening posts there from which
they could get early warning
of our intentions.
Moreover the
airfield on Pantelleria could hold some 80 fighters.
This airfield
in enemy hands, could be a great nuisance; in our own it would be
an important asset, as it would increase the fighter support available
for the assault on Sicily.
Considerable opposition was possible from the island garrisons,
which were estimated to number 10,000 on Pantelleria and 4,000
on Lampedusa.
The plan involved the use of some 12,000 men, the
task being allotted to the Ist Infantry Division.
The assault, which
was mounted from Sousse, was preceded by an extremely heavy air
bombardment.
On the morning of June IIth, 1943,
soon
after
the
first wave of assaulting troops got ashore,
the
garrison of
Pantelleria surrendered.
Lampedusa followed suit the next day.
The RASC was represented by more than 100 men, including
one transport platoon.
It had been expected that there would be a
lack of water,
and provision had been made to import enough to
meet all requirements.
However many wells and cisterns were
found to be undamaged, and sufficient water was available on the
islands.
There was nearly a crisis in the supply situation when stocks fell
to only two days owing to the manner in which the stores LCTs and
a coaster from Algiers had been loaded.
Ammunition, which, in
the event, was not required, had been loaded on top of the supplies,
and even if it had been agreed to unload the unwanted ammunition,
the difficulty of getting the coaster into the port would have delayed
the off-loading of the supplies for several days.
After the capture of Pantelleria the enemy made repeated air
attacks on the port, and it was during the withdrawal of that part
of the invasion force which was not to remain on the island that the
few casualties were incurred.
The RASC had six men killed and
nine wounded out of a total of II who took part in the operation.
The Course of Operations in Sicily
The final plan for the invasion of Sicily was based on a series of
simultaneous seaborne assaults, assisted by airborne landings, on the
south-eastern corner of the island.
The plan was to seize the ports
of Syracuse and Licata and the airfields within striking distance of
the coastline between these two ports, in order to establish a firm
operations against the Augusta,
