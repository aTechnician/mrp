was 17% oz, 10% oz, and 8 oz respectively.
However, the manipula-
tion of employment returns,
etc., gave a margin to play with, and
so the men in hospital, classed as 'no duty', could be brought up to
the light duty scale.
By March, 1945,
the rice even for heavy
duty had been cut to about g oz, and sometimes was as low as 8 oz.
All the prisoners of war had to undergo
humiliations and ill
treatment, such as being made to stand motionless on
the parade
ground for hours at a stretch, and being slapped on the face and
having to take it without protest.
But even this was not the worst.
In the latter part of 1942, 50,000 prisoners of war were sent up to
build the notorious Siam railway from Bangkok to Moulmein, a
distance in a direct line of 240 miles.
It was said that every sleeper
in it cost a man's life.
In April, 1943,
another party, called F
Force, 7,000 strong, and in May, 1943,
H Force, 3,000 all ranks,
including an officers' party of 350, left Changi.
They were told
that they were going to a place where there would be better food
and less work.
They
were taken by train from Singapore to a
point 50 miles from
Bangkok.
From there, F Force began to
march.
No transport was provided,
the food was bad, and the
staging camps were just open fields.
Most of the men marched in
this way about 1go miles to the Burma border, and on arrival were
driven to
work by Japanese engineers.
Cholera caused many
casualties.
In spite of strong representations, there was no slacken-
ing in the work, and when the party returned to Changi in December,
1943, no fewer than 2,500 had died.
H Force was slightly luckier,
as transport was provided part of the way, but the officers suffered
the indignity of having to work as coolies.
This party lost about
800 of its strength,
and the RASC casualties in the two forces
amounted to more than 300.
After the war Lieutenant W. S. Mitchell was made a Member of
the Order of the British Empire, Cpl C. E. Johnson, Dvr J. H. Clegg,
Dvr J. Greenberg, and Pte J. F. Higgins received the British Empire
Medal.
Lieut-Colonel G. E. C. Rossall, Majors Jenson and Marsh,
Capt E. F. Moisson, and SSMs Wier and Carey all received
mentions in
despatches in recognition of their services
whilst
prisoners in Japanese hands.
In this same list was included the
name of Major R. S. Sykes who, after being wounded on February
I4th, 1942, was killed in an Allied raid on Siam in 1944•
