ARY FORCE,
the amount or roo
ammunition which were available
with the BEF on May igth, although the food in their possession
has been assessed as high as 12
days' rations.
The personal
experiences of CRASC do not substantiate
this estimate, as
formations only managed to exist by having recourse to wide scale
foraging.
Most formations had two or three days' food in their
unit and RASC transport, and some CRASC admit to having
acquired unofficial reserves quite irregularly at the beginning of the
campaign, but, as it so turned out, most opportunely.
Orders had
been given on May 17th for all rail traffic from the base to be
switched from through Amiens to via Abbeville, but it seems to be
generally established that the last pack trains to be received were
those which arrived on the 18th. The only static reserve of food held
north of the Somme, at Doullens, had been disposed of just before the
enemy captured the depot.
Two of the reserve trains of food left
the BSD at Le Havre on the i4th and I6th respectively, but it is
doubtful if the third, which left on the 18th,
ever
reached its
destination.
The petrol position was probably better, as stocks were available
in some civil installations, so long as they could be decanted and
distributed.
Some stock was available in petrol trains and at the
newly established filling centre near Lille.
The large static depot at
Vignacourt, north of the Somme, fell into enemy hands on the 19th,
but most of the stock
was reported as destroyed before it was
captured.
The
available supplies of ammunition included unit
reserves,
some dumps and some stock which was on trains which
had reached the area before the break occurred.
There was little that the Directors of Supplies and Transport
could do to influence the situation,
and their task was made no
easier by the sudden decision to move the rear maintenance staff
and heads of services at GHQ from their headquarters at Habarca,
a few miles from Arras, to Boulogne on the 18th and then to
Wimereux.
reserves available
were
already under
corps
control, and the three DDs ST at corps headquarters (Brigadiers
L. G. Humphreys, C. le B. Goldney and V. O. Beuttler) could do
little more than see that the resources left were fairly apportioned.
Effective control by the DDs ST of RASC transport became almost
impossible owing to continued changes in the responsibility of corps
for formations,
the numerous detachments which were made from
one area to another,
and the fact that many units or detachments
which were in the vicinity of the Channel ports were evacuated with-
out any warning.
Supply became a matter for the individual initiative of CRASC
and their officers,
and the success with which they were able to
maintain
their
formations largely depended on their personal
