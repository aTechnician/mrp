THE MIDDLE EAST 1
RASC of this opportunity to gain experience in the desert itself, and
foul though the road as far as Fuka then was, it was not desert.
In the year before the outbreak of war,
there was built up in
Egypt an unestablished, under-strength, formation
known as the
‹Mobile Division (Egypt)' afterwards to become the
famous 7th
Armoured Division.
The planned RASC contribution to this formation
companies of 24 vehicles (5 and 65 Companies) and the vehicles of
two others (25 and 66 Companies).
interesting
comparison with that of the present-day armoured
division.
In fact, however, the division itself was proportionately
weak in all arms and the g6 vehicles, though below requirements,
proportionately were not really inadequate.
Towards the end of August, 1939, the usual rush out to Matruh
took place, and as the war with Italy did not break out then,
unique opportunity for training presented itself.
Full advantage of
this was taken by all arms, including the RASC, and when
the
division went back to the Delta in December, there was probably
no better trained divisional RASC, small though it was,
in the
British Army.
Transport Problems
Moreover, it had become apparent to the RASC and to the AA
and QMG (Lieut-Colonel later Major-General C. M. Smith, RASC)
that the system of refilling second line transport and subsequently
transferring the loads to first line transport at ammunition, petrol
and supply points, was impracticable in the desert.
There were
two important reasons for this.
The first was that an expected,
and later realized, Axis air superiority would find a sitting target
in the collection of vehicles that inevitably occurs at refilling points.
The second and even more important reason was the
terrain in
which the division was likely to operate.
The only road in the
Western Desert was that which followed the coast from Alexandria
and Sidi Barrani.
True, there were caravan routes, very ancient
ones, running inland from the coast to Siwa, but only that from
Matruh could be readily traced throughout its length, and for the
most part they ran in the wrong direction for this particular war.
Parallel to the coast there were no defined routes, and the going
varied.
There was lumpy lava which would never break up,
but
which could only be traversed at a few miles an hour, and had a
disastrous effect on vehicles wheeled or tracked: there was sand of
many kinds which could be crossed at varying speeds,
and there
were tracts of soft loose sand impassible for
wheels and sometimes
even for tracks.
