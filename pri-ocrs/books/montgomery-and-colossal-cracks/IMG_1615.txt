Montgomery and "Colossal Cracks"
the closeness and symbiotic nature of the two commanders' relationship, and by
the ambiguities in the historical record; for together these factors confuse
definitive appreciation of the authorship of crucial decisions.
The balance of the evidence leads to the slightly ambiguous conclusion that
although Miles Dempsey's role as an army commander remained somewhat
restricted due to his superior's interference, he was by no means the colorless
cipher as suggested by much of the campaign's historical literature.
The two
faces of a seemingly Janus-like Dempsey do not sit together at all well; the
image of Dempsey the introverted, subservient cipher, sidelined as Montgomery
dealt direct with his corps commanders, rankles with the picture of Dempsey,
the architect of "Goodwood," the competent commander with fingertip feel,
willing to intervene in and firmly grip his corps commanders' break-in opera-
tions, and to keep tight control of reserves.
Undoubtedly the reality of
Dempsey's role in the campaign lies in some uneasy combination of these two
contradictory images.
Perhaps the latter picture may have been closer to the
true Dempsey.
That the former image has to date dominated the historical
literature is due to Montgomery's suppressing influence on his subordinate's
personality and to Dempsey's stoic toleration of the interventions of his superior,
a forbearance based on Dempsey's recognition that Montgomery possessed an
ability in the operational art of war that only was equaled by very few com-
manders in the British army of 1944.117
These ambiguities and uncertainties may be rather unsatisfactory, yet they
serve to illustrate that this analysis is merely the start of the process whereby
Miles Dempsey is rescued from an undeserved historical oblivion.
Ultimately it
seems unlikely that historians will ever pin down precisely Dempsey's contribu-
tion to the conduct of this campaign, given that the emergence of significant
new documentary material relating to Dempsey is now unlikely.
Dempsey's
counterpart —the other army commander within the 21st Army Group -Henry
"Harry" Crerar, also remains a "forgotten victor" of the campaign.
there is not the same dearth of documentary evidence that relates to Crerar as
there does with Dempsey. And it is to Crerar, and the First Canadian Army, that
this study now turns.
