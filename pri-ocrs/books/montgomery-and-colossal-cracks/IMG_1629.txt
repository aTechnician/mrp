Montgomery and "Colossal Cracks"
assault crossing of the River Rhine.
All factors considered, the only sensible
course was to allocate the task of undertaking "Veritable" to the First Canadian
Army; Montgomery's tardiness at conceding this attests to his suspicions of
Crerar's abilities.
To summarize, it can be seen that Crerar was a competent army commander,
but not much more than that.
He was too concerned with nonoperational
matters, too inexperienced, too weak a field commander, and too determined to
protect Canadian interests to gain Montgomery's confidence.
This was SO,
despite Crerar being fully inculcated with the Field Marshal's operational
methods. However, these weaknesses exerted only a limited adverse impact on
the campaign because Crerar held both of his two capable corps commanders on
a loose rein.
Both the operational factors observed here and the national aspects of inter-
Commonwealth military cooperation, permeated the relationship between Crerar
and Montgomery. As a result, Montgomery and the 21st Army Group treated
Cerar's First Canadian Army differently than Dempsey's Second (British)
Army. The Field Marshal held back Crerar's Army headquarters during the first
six weeks of the Normandy campaign. In the Scheldt, Montgomery allocated it
too large a task for its limited resources, and consequently the Field Marshal
failed to ensure that Antwerp was opened quickly to Allied shipping.
"Veritable" Montgomery struggled hard to evade the operational logic that
indicated he should allocate the offensive to the Canadians.
The relationship
between Crerar and the First Canadian Army on the one hand and Montgomery
and his army group on the other clearly impacted on the manner in which the
21st Army Group as an institution conducted the Northwest Europe campaign.
