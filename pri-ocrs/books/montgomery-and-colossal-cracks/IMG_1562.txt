Montgomery and "Colossal Cracks"

"did not discuss the manpower situation with a certain individual. This will be
all right."2 It is unfortunate that the archives do not shed light on the identity of
this individual.
Certainly, Britain -for political reasons-often did not keep
their American allies fully informed about the seriousness of the British
manpower crisis.!3 Given this fact, one might speculate that de Guingand was
referring to Eisenhower, but the identity of this person may never be firmly
established.
Many of the Anglo-American frictions evident during the cam-
paign stemmed from British reluctance to admit the seriousness of their
manpower problems.
For this reticence made it much harder for American
commanders to comprehend Montgomery's cautious operational methods.
As D-Day loomed closer, British concerns over manpower increased rather
than abated. On 19 May 1944 Montgomery informed Brooke that "the implica-
tions of the manpower situation on the 21st Army Group are going to be very
serious."
For Montgomery's command was "already short of over 13,000 men
of our W[ar] E[stablishment] plus authorised reinforcements even before we
commence fighting," and this situation, Montgomery continued, "will deterio-
rate. "14
Similarly, on 30 May 1944 Major Peter Earle, Military Assistant to
General Nye the Vice-CIGS (VCIGS), noted in his diary that by June 1944 "we
will be approximately 90,000 men short in 21 Army Group," and consequently
"a reduction of some five divisions will have to be effected to provide rein-
forcements." In conclusion Earle observed that "we are about to enter on this
vast project with only three weeks' reserves, which is unheard of in the annals of
history. "Is
This evidence demonstrates that these worries were not, as Horne
observed, "a concern little voiced before" D-Day, but rather a long-recognized
problem.'" Given this "emergency" Montgomery urged Brooke to order "drastic
pruning" of the training schools in the United Kingdom, so that the 21st Army
Group could at least start the D-Day invasion at almost full strength.!?
The War Office had long anticipated this looming manpower crisis, and as
early as September 1943 had taken steps to minimize its consequences!8
The
Personal Minute that Grigg presented to the Prime Minister on 25 March 1944
referred to measures already taken to avert this shortage!'
Grigg commented
that an October 1943 Cabinet paper had observed that even if the army canni-
balized the six Lower Establishment Divisions in the United Kingdom by June
1944 to provide reinforcements for Montgomery, expected infantry reinforce-
ments would still not meet expected casualties in Normandy.20
In February
1944 the War Office estimated infantry casualties for the first six months of the
campaign as 61,255 all ranks; they based this figure on a "medium" definition of
infantry that, in addition to rifle infantry, included commandos, Foot Guards and
special service troops (see Table 3.1).
The equivalent War Office casualty
estimate based on a "wide" definition of infantry that also included machine
gun- and motorized- infantry was 67,132 men. These two estimates respectively
amounted to 38 and 41.7 percent of the total 171,855 estimated British casual-
ties for all ranks across all branches in the first six months of the campaign (see
Table 3.1). These figures produced an average monthly infantry casualty rate of
between 10,209 and 11,189 (on "medium" and "wide" definitions, respectively).

This compared to an estimated total average monthly casualty rate of 28,642
soldiers of all ranks.21
