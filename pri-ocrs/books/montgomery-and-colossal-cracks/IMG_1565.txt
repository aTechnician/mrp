Montgomery and "Colossal Cracks"
miscellaneous units.
Training units typically consisted of a small cadre of
trainers, and a bulk of new recruits undergoing training.
Though most of the
trainers possessed combat experience, many were not fully fit or had previously
shown signs of battle fatigue, and hence the High Command deemed them unfit
for infantry combat overseas.
Equally, the training of infantry recruits was a
long and thorough affair. Just like the German army until 1944, the manpower
crisis within the British army did not prompt more than minor curtailing of the
thoroughness of infantry training.
To send men half-trained into combat was a
guarantee that many would swiftly die for their inexperience, and quite correctly
this was something that Britain was not prepared to do.?
Therefore, as of 30
June 1944 the vast majority of these 53,000 troops were not available immedi-
ately as reinforcements for the 21st Army Group.
Over the next six months,
however, approximately some 50-75 percent of these infantry troops would
arrive in France as replacements for Montgomery's forces.
The other 57,612 infantrymen in D'Este's 30 June 1944 inventory belonged
to 93 regimental infantry battalions and 15 independent companies?8
AT TITST
glance, it seems possible that these troops may have been available as replace-
ments for the casualties incurred by the 21st Army Group. The fact that the War
Office undertook a series of extensive reorganizations of Home Forces through-
out 1944, however, prevents anything more than an approximate analysis of the
composition of these 108 units.
Despite this, such an analysis of these 57,612
infantrymen clearly demonstrates that the vast majority of these troops were not
draft-quality —and therefore
remained
unavailable
as
reinforcements
Montgomery's command. This analysis is depicted Table 3.3.
Some 8,000 of these 57,612 infantrymen remained unavailable to Montgom-
ery as the War Office held them as its Strategic Reserve. The vast majority of
the 22,000 personnel in the training formations remained only partially trained,
and thus not yet fit for combat overseas. Neither could Montgomery draft the
instructor cadres in these units without seriously disrupting the training of new
recruits, which now constituted Britain's main source of infantry reinforcements;
furthermore, as this study has already observed, many of these instructors were
medically or psychologically unfit for drafting. By 30 June 1944, the only
sources of drafts for Montgomery's command were the roughly 13,000 combat-
fit infantry in the Lower Establishment divisions. However, the War Office had
always intended to use this source to meet the manpower demands (for 13,000
infantry) of Montgomery's forces during the first two months of the campaign.
However, not only did the entire defense of the United Kingdom rest on their
shoulders, but they were already on average at 50 percent of their War Estab-
lishment; further drafting could only bring into question their remaining
integrity as units.
Therefore, by August 1944 after the War Office had dis-
patched these 13,000 troops to France, there remained very few draftable troops
available in the United Kingdom, even after strict combing. If the 21st Army
Group suffered especially heavy infantry casualties during the Normandy
campaign, it would only be able to replace this wastage by breaking up some of
its own field formations to provide the necessary reinforcements."
