"Colossal Cracks" I: The Set-Piece Battle
This chapter examines the key characteristics of Montgomery's operational
technique in conducting this campaign, and demonstrates the overwhelming
contribution that Montgomery made to the operational methods utilized by the
21st Army Group.
Before commencing this investigation, a brief discussion of
doctrinal development in the British army in the years 1939-44 is necessary.
The 1939-45 British army-following a long tradition —relied heavily on
extemporaneous pragmatism rather than on a formally expressed doctrine of
war! There existed two impulses on the development of British army methods
during the Second World War: First, the War Office in London formulated
official doctrine and disseminated this through Army Training Instructions and
Memoranda, plus Military Training Pamphlets; second, the personal experi-
ences and policies of British higher formation commanders in the field produced
doctrine in practice? Despite the existence of official policy, in practice the
methods of British higher formations in the field reflected the individual policies
of their commanders. The latter were free to issue their own doctrinal memo-
randa as long as these policies did not contradict substantially the official War
Office position? In this process of doctrinal development the dissemination of
operational and tactical ideas flowed both ways between field commanders and
the War Office, and through this process a broad consensus on "a particular
Commonwealth style of fighting" emerged "between Dunkirk and 1944."4
As a result of this lack of explicit doctrine, however, the development of the
British army's operational methods relied heavily on the experiences and
policies of individual field commanders; the War Office typically reflected these
developments rather than initiated them.
Wartime doctrinal development up to
D-Day naturally derived much of its substance from the 1940 43 combat
experiences in North Africa.
This decentralization of doctrinal development
permitted substantial variance to emerge between the field policies of senior
commanders and official doctrine. Throughout 1943 General Montgomery,
