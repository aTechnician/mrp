The Maintenance of Morale
A central argument of this study is that the connected issues of the maintenance
of morale and casualty conservation exerted a key influence on Montgomery's
operational conduct of this campaign. Put simply, the Field Marshal conducted
the campaign in a way designed both to maintain the morale of his troops and to
avoid heavy casualties.
These two considerations represented the key motiva-

all the characteristics that comprised his operational approach. The

For the avoidance of heavy casualties bolstered the mora
civilian soldiers fielded by the 21st Army Group during the inevit-
degradation caused by participation in active operations; and
facilitated a superior battlefield performance that contributed, ceter

Although the existing literature has recognized that these factors

on his conduct of the campaign.
Neither have scholars elucidated clea
degree to which these considerations permeated Montgomery's entire
tional approach' All army commanders are concerned with the morale
forces and the casualties that result from the use of this force. However,
issue for historians is how important these two considerations are in rele
the other influences on a commander's conduct of a campaign: What a
significance in relation to military objectives, relative force strengths, d
and the unfolding operational situation within a campaign?
