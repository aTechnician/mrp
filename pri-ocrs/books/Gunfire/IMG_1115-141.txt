capture the Ruhr
With all its still fairlv
undamaged industry. This would have a decisive
impact on the German capacity to wage war.
With the Ruhr region captured the road to
Berlin would be open, it was thought. The war
would be ended before the turn of the year
Hence, one was prepared to take large risks to
obtain the goal.
'A bridge too far'
The resources made available for Operation
Market Garden were 1 Airborne Corps and VIII,
XII and XXX Corps of the 2nd British Army. The
airborne resources were under command of Lieu-
tenant General Frederick 'Boy' Browning and
were assigned the task to lay a 'carpet' from the
Belgian-Dutch
border
via Eindhoven
and
Nijmegen up to Arnhem. This meant capturing
all important bridges across the rivers Maas, Waal
and Rhine (the Dutch call it Neder Riin, and
sometimes Lek) and a few canals between them
The Airborne Corps assigned the task given
to the 82nd and 101st U.S. Airborne Divisions
This would secure the route of advance for XXX
Corps. The latter had been given the task to
advance as quickly as possible to Arnhem and
there reinforce the

XXX Corps had to reach Arnhem within 72
hours at the latest, this after having advanced
along one road onlv: with the Guards Division
leading and the 43rd (Wessex) and the 50th
Infantry Divisions following suit. No actions on
the flanks were to be taken by the Corps
Protection of the flanks was to be entirely the
roles of VIII Corps on the right and XII Corps
on the left side.
In order to reinforce the protection of
upply transport along Club Route, as the route
of advance was called, three special battle groups
were employed. The first one was to reintorce a
regiment of the 101st U.S. Airborne Division
(506 RCT [Regimental Combat Team]) which
was to capture Eindhoven, The group was to
comprise a reinforced tank regiment from the
British 11th Armoured Division, the 15/19th
Hussars, supported by one battery from 86 Field
Regiment RA equipped with SP guns
The second battle group, which also came
under American command, the 501 RCT, was
given the task to reinforce the defence of Veghel
The group also comprised a reinforced British
tank regiment, 44 Royal Tank Regiment, from 4
British Armoured Brigade. This group was
supported by a battery from 4 Field Regiment
RA which was normally supporting the brigade
The third battle group was put under
command of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division to
reinforce the protection of the large bridge at
8 Armoured Brigade
(Which
was
under
command of the 43rd (Wessex) Division), (the
- ARNHEM
Notunghamshire Yeomanry), was given the task.
In its turn this regiment was supported by 513
Battery RA from 147 Field Regiment RHA. 363
With thee
battle groups each American
parachute battalion would thus be supported by
at least one tank regiment and a British artillery
battery in addition to the airborne divisions' own
artillery unit
A smaller Dutch Brigade, the Princess Irene
Brigade
also engaged and was under
command of the 43rd (Wessex) Division, 366 It
was to be used for similar protecting tasks along
Club Route

was a Belgian brigade emploved in the same wav.
It is worth noting that the two flank Corps
had not yet crossed the heavily defended Meuse-
Escaut Canal (the Dutch and Belgian called it
Maas-Schelde Canal) whereas XXX Corps, by
a daring advance, had managed to establish a
small bridgehead north of the canal towards the
Dutch border on 10 September.
The ground offensive from 'Joe's Bridge' at
this bridgehead was 'Operation Garden' in the
overall operation plan. But there was another
formation available, although not much has been
written about it. It was the 52nd (Lowland
Infantry Division, which had been attached to
the British Airborne Corps. This division had
been well trained for warfare in mountamous
terrain - Norway being a potential area for
engagement. But had, as we have seen in a
previous chapter, commenced training in the
summer 1944 for a role as an air-transported
division for support of airborne divisions. Air
transport meant neither parachute denlovment
nor transport to the battlefield with gliders. but
conveyance by means of transport aircraft
primarily C47 Dakota (DC 3). Hence, it wa:
necessary to have access to airfields. although
these could be quite simple grass strips.
An opportunity for the employment of this
division
was
Operation Market
Garden
Although the main idea was to proceed towards
Ruhr after Arnhem, the area between this city
and lisselmeer (Zuider Zee) had first to be
secured and all German forces in western
Holland
sealed off
and prevented from
interfering with the offensive towards the Ruhr
The sealing off was to be undertaken by the
Guards Division and the 43rd (Wessex) Division
who were to be given half each of this front line
from Arnhem up to lisselmeer (Zuider Tee) Thi
meant that they both had to cover around 30km
