In the 2 Army artillery plan it is stated
that this battalion was equipped with SP
guns.
347 A map with these 'trig points' is included
in the Kirkman Papers at James Clavell
Library, Royal Artillery Museum (RAHT
MD/3138)
348 In Whetton/Ogden: Z. Location, pp. 83-84
a detailed presentation is given as to how
the units of 4 Survey Regiment RA were

landed and the tasks assigned to them.
Ibid. pp. 87-88.
Good presentations of the employment of
SP guns can be found in several articles
of The Gunner. See for instance the article
by Major General Jack Parham in the
March 1969 edition and a follow-up
article by Brigadier G.G. Mears in the
June 1969 edition. Here a later article
(1994?) by Major General T.A.
Richardson has been the source used.
Meirs and Richardson both were
subalterns and engaged in the 'run-in-
351
shoot' on D-Day, on 6 June 1944.

attached

369 This account is primarily built on the
report prepared by Loder-Symonds after
the war. See e.g. RAHT MD/1437. In a
slightly shortened edition the renort is
also reproduced in RA Notes 1944, para
1312.
370 In 'Sheriff' Thompson's article in Royal
Artillery Journal, Vol. LXXIV, No. 1, he
shows in detall how the regiment was to
be loaded on board 87 Horsas, when
available. One Horsa could carry three
tons, so detailed loading tables had to be
prepared. In order to bring 137 shells per
gun these had to be dispersed to all
gliders. Those carrying a gun with its Jeep
could only bring nine shells to avoid over-
loading. The number 137 per gun is often
mentioned in the literature. but in reality
it was less as four gliders and two guns
