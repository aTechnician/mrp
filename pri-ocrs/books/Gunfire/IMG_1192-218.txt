It might here be added that the famous
cinema film The Bridge on River Kwai
with Sir Alec Guiness as the main star
character, Colonel Nicholson, has a
certain true background from the
campaign. It was the commanding officer
of 135 Field Regiment RA, Lieutenant
Colonel Tosey, and his captured gunners
who built the bridge, or more correctly
two bridges, one temporary and one
permanent, the latter still existing. After
the construction of the bridges Colonel
losey became a much appreciated leader
of the POWs in various prison camps,
where he restlessly did what he could to
improve the severe situation the prisoners
encountered, often taking large personal
risks. Thus assuming quite different a role
than the one Colonel Nicholson had been
given in the film. More about this in
Davies (1991).

Primary sources for this section has been
Pemberton (1950), Bailey (2004) and -
not the least - articles and books by
Brigadier Bidwell. RA Notes 1944 also
have many interesting testimonies from
the field. An attempt to summarise is e.g.
Employment of Artillery in Jungle Warfare,
RA Notes 1944, Para. 1260.

At Royal Artillery Museum in London a
gun of this type is on display.

A summary of British experience of
Japanese battle techniques and how local
defence must be arranged is found in
M.G.R.A. Training Instruction No. 3 1944.
Japanese methods of Counter Battery. 30.3

473
An often told example of what the
Japanese could accomplish as regards
infiltration was a case where a battery one
morning found that a whole Japanese
platoon during the night had dug in
between the two troops of the battery
without anybody noticing it. A company
of Sikhs was needed to get the platoon
wiped out to the last man

Young (Osprey) tells that during the
period 18th April to 22nd June 1944,
when the encircled IV Corps comprised
four infantry divisions and two armoured
brigades, in total some 150,000 men.
1,043 tons of ammunition, 5,960 tons of
other supplies and replacements were
flown in. Around 15,000 wounded and
45,000 'non-combatants' were taken out
with returning aircraft. At its peak around
200 aircraft/day arrived.
475
A gunner playing a distinguished role
during the final months of the battle was
Brigadier A.H. Hely, who was a much
appreciated divisional artillery
commander (CRA) of the 7th Indian
Infantry Division. He is a good example
of a skilled territorial officer whose
capacity was observed early and taken
advantage of. He was a dentist in his
civilian life but in parallel with this served
in the Territorial Army back home in
England. When the war broke out his
regiment was transferred to Egypt and
there took part in the fighting 1940 and
later. In 1942 he was regimental
commander with the rank of Lieutenant
Colonel until August that year when he
was promoted Brigadier and positioned
as artillery commander of the mentioned
division. He established good relations
and efficient cooperation with
subordinate regimental commanders and
superior commanders. In 1944 and 1945
he was the natural second-in-command
of the division and was for periods during
the final fighting acting divisional
commander, maybe the only non-regular
officer to reach this position. After the
war he returned to civilian life and served
as Chief Dentist.
