NOTES
by the artillery headquarters of the 43rd
(Wessex) Division it is stated that both
troops of 212 Battery RA were deployed
near the road to Elst about 2km south of
this village (C Troop at 689680 and D
Troop at 687684). There was hardly any
reason to have the units deployed to these
positions on 26 September as the
evacuation of the remaining part of 1
Airborne Division then had been
completed. Hence this is another
indication that the battery's re-
deployment took place on 25 September
416
These orders are attached to the war diaries
of 64 Medium Regiment RA and 94 Field
Regiment RA. The commanding officer of
the former (Hunt) has in his personal diary
noted that it was the artillery commander of
43 (Wessex) Division who had issued the
fire plan for the night, which strengthens
the assumption that the fire order 'Java' was
the one to be fired in protection of the
evacuation.
417
The fire order is attached to the war diary
of 94 Field Regiment RA.

As regards sound ranging bases and
observations bases within the XII Corps
section the deployment has been taken
from a map presented by Lieutenant
Colonel Clegg, commander of 7 Survey
Regiment RA, dated 17 June 1945. It is
found in several sources, amongst them
RAHT MD/2664. The corresponding
deployment within XXX Corps section is
based on reports attached to the war
diary of 4 Survey Regiment RA (WO

In his letter (exact date of it unknown)
Campbell argues in favour of restrictions
in the application of large fire
concentrations on just map references
and not prior ranging. 1oo extensive lists
with numerous target coordinates that
might be used were wearing down
command post staffs and increased the
risk that their work is losing in precision
and accuracy, a consequence of which is
artillery fire at the wrong place and waste
of ammunition. With his own words: 'It
has lead everyone to believe that if a gun
is aimed at a point that it will hit that
point. This of course is far from the case
as no gun, except by chance, will hit a
point aimed at without ranging and a
considerable expenditure of ammunition.'
A consequence of the practice was to
make the observation parties more like
liaison detachments than fire controllers
So, he wanted much more of ranging and
that FOOs/OPOs should act in their real
capacity. He concluded: 'The un-ranged
fire for all concentrations in front of our
own troops is the method of fire which
should be avoided.'
Campbell touches another problem,
namely the importance of having the
infantry to advance close behind the
artillery fire in attack in order to be able to
cut in on the enemy directly when the fire
is lifted forwards, this irrespective of the
nature of the covering fire, a creeping or
rolling barrage, or timed concentrations.
Often the infantry was far behind, often
due to bad accuracy of large
concentrations without prior ranging. We
can see that this was a repeated 'system
problem' through the war, and Campbell's
letter was one of many expressions of
oninions on central issues His letter 16
