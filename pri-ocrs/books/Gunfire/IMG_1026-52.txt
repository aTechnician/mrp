equipment, weapons for local
defence, personal kit etc. So, now the gunners
had to practice driving and loading of the Jeeps,
and, not the least, to get them loaded into a
Dakota. This too, required much training, which
was not out of problems for the gun crew and
the aircraft.
Detailed loading tables had to be prepared
to ensure that all necessary items of equipment
were taken and that there was no overloading or
dangerous distribution of weight. These tables
specified the positions where all men, irrespec-
tive of rank, would sit in the aircraft and how
much personal kit they could take
Besides basic gunnery training and later
firing practice with the mountain howitzers new
procedures and standing orders for reconnais-
sance and deployment had to be worked out
The first regimental firing exercise with live am-
munition took place a couple of weeks after the
Fig. 7-5 One of the armament alternatives for
formations preparing for air transportation to a battle
theatre was an adapted version of the old British
3.7-inch mountain howitzer (RAHT)
training had commenced, and the result was
good. The air-transported gunners-to-be felt
ready to go into battle, but they still had to wait
for it. Hence, the training programme continued
up to August 1944, as were various improve-
ments to get the regiment even more fit for fight
As the regiment must be ready also for a sea-
borne assault, this had to be prepared as well.
But this alternative the regiment felt well ac-
quainted with. It had been practiced numerous
times in Scotland long before the air-transporta-
tion alternative emerged.
Now, how were the 52nd (Lowland) Division
and its artillery to be engaged in real battle? Well,
I will come back to that later in the book.
