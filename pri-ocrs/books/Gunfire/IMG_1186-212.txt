ORGANISATION AND EQUIPMENT
The organization of formations at higher
levels, Corps and Divisions, changed
during the war, in particular this was the
case as regards armoured divisions. The
presentation here reflects the organization
applied during the last years of the war.
More about this in Forty (2002).

111 A hyperbola is a plane curve, such that
the difference of the distances from any
4161
NOTES
point on it to two fixed points, the foci, is
constant. In sound ranging a pair of
microphones represents the foci and the
time difference between arrivals of the
sound wave to the pair gives the
hyperbola. At long distances from the foci
the hyperbola can be approximated by its
asymptote. In practical sound ranging
this was the case, hence, the asymptote
gave the direction to the gun from which
the sound wave originated. An alternative
plotting method was the 'Circle Method',
which however was not normally used by
the British during the war.

correct. Some sources are giving the

include an Indian Survey Regiment. Here
