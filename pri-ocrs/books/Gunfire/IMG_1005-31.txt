of welding methods as a substitute for riveting.
At the beginning as many 4.5-inch guns as
5,5-inch guns were manufactured, but as previ-
ously mentioned a shift towards the latter
gradually took place. At the end of the war 754
barrels of the smaller calibre had been manufac-
tured as compared with 2,250 with the larger
calibre. In total 2,453 carriages were manufac-
tured.? Manufacturing was forced heavily until
the end of 1943 when a drastic reduction of the
monthly output came, and it continued there-
after at a low level. Also when looking at this part
of the artillery rearmament, we can note that it
took about five years to complete, despite the
massive mobilisation and redirection of industry
None of the medium guns were up to the re-
liability standard of the 25-pounder. Problems
arose already at the beginning with the carriages,
later also as regards buffer/recuperators and
breeches. These 'teething troubles' emerged at
first in connection with the large and extended
dre programmes at El Alamein in October 1942
There also occurred some prematures with dev-
astating consequences for the gun detachments
In Burma in particular, such problems were
quite frequent, which reduced the gunners' con-
fidence in this type of gun
Initially the life of the barrels was estimated
to be equivalent to 3,000 rounds fired, but after
El Alamein this was reduced to 2,000 rounds. An
advantage was. however, that it was easy to
replace a worn-out barrel, even in the field.
Whilst the introduction of the lighter 801b
shell was in order to accomplish the longer
range, the other likely reason was, as mentioned,
to reduce the mechanical strain on the barrel and
thus to reduce the damage risk.
Heavy artillery neglected
Even if the design and manufacture of new
medium guns had had to stand back because of
the development of the 25-pounder and the 3.7-
inch heavy anti-aircraft gun, the situation was
much worse as regards the necessary develop
ment of new heavy guns, the Heavies. We may
recall the ongoing discussions during the 1930s
as to whether bomber aircraft could take over the
role that the heavy guns had had in the Great War.
These discussions did not end before the new war
broke out
but also national economy and
shortage of industrial resources led to a negativi
impact on the development of heavy guns. And
the result was, as we have seen, that no modern
heavy guns were available when the war broke out
in 1939. This was not only the case as regards
guns in the calibre range of 6-8 inches (15-20
cm), but also guns with even larger calibre, the
Super Heavies. New guns were not available.
In order to improve the situation somewnat,
and reduce the number of calbres and related
logistic problems, it was decided in the autumn
1940 to concentrate on one calibre, the 7.2-1nch
(183-mm). This should be accomplished by
providing a new barrel on carriages of the
vintage 6-inch gun and - in parucular - the
