mobile, surface-to-air missiles. If there had been, the Americans could not have
operated in the way they did.
35. Ploger, US Army Engineers 1965, Vietnam Studies, pp. 115 and 124. In 1969,
70,000 tons of rock were used by U.S. Army engineers every week. This rate more
than doubled in 1970. See also Dunn, Base Development in South Vietnam
1965-1970, pp. 99-112. The U.S. Army carried out considerable work to improve
the rail system. By 1971 about 60 per cent of the original railway was in use again.
Increasing amounts of freight were carried each year until the U.S. withdrawal.
36. Heiser, Op. cit., p. 41. There were, for example, three push packages and fifteen
increments for an airborne brigade. Each one had 24,000 separate items and a
varying amount of each item depending on the estimated consumption. Together
they were intended to provide 240 days' supply. In 1965, the cost of one such
package was over $19 million.

44. Shore, The Battle for Khe Sanh. The B-52s, particularly, wielded an awesome
power. Each carried a 27 ton payload of 108 mixed 500 and 750lb bombs. The
bombs churned up strips of terrain several thousand yards long, and the ground for
miles around shock from the concussion alone. In some instances, NVA soldiers
were found after a B-52 strike wandering around in a daze with blood streaming
from their noses and mouths. Often, the internal haemorrhaging induced by the
concussion was so severe that it resulted in death. To catch the stunned survivors
above ground, the gunners inside the base put down fire missions into the target
area for 10 to 15 minutes after the last B-52 had gone.
45. Shore, pp. 85-87. Often as many as 16 helicopters were used up to four times in one
day during the Super Gaggle without loss.
Before the introduction of this
technique, as many as three helicopters were shot down in one day around Khe
Sanh.
46. Tolson, pp. 226-227. Captured records indicated that the 'City' supported the 7th
NVA Division.
47. Davidson, p. 627. The total haul included: 23,000 individual weapons, enough to
equip 74 full strength NVA battalions: 2,500 crew-served weapons, 25 battalions
worth; 16,700,000 rounds of small-arms ammunition one year's expenditure;
14 million Ibs of rice; 143,000 rounds of mortar, rocket, and recoilless rifle
ammunition; and about 200,000 rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition.

Large truck convoys moved along this route and the infiltration corridors into
South Vietnam by day and night. ARVN intelligence estimated that the amount of
supplies stored at NV A rear service bases actually in South Vietnam, were enough
to support their troops for 13 to 18 months at the 1972 tempo of activity
51. Khuyen, pp. 264, 346, 376 and 418. The effect of the cut back in U.S. aid in 1973/74
can be seen from the examples in the table below which shows the piece-by-piece
eplacement of critical equipment. These are only extracts, the whole
contains eight items, and the average replacement rate is one sixth of that
requested:

Also Khuyen, pp. 414, 416 and p. 420. 'History has it that the U.S. Congress chose
to ignore the survival package and opt for humanitarian aid for those who
survived'. Khuyen is alluding to the final requests for aid as the survival packages
for the RVNAF. The use of individual clothing and jungle boots was extended from
6 months to 9-18 months for combat troops. In the author's experience as a
logistician in the Far East, a pair of jungle boots could be worn out on one ten day
patrol. The state of mind of the U.S. Congress can be judged by the fact that they
allocated a Congressional conference room to Jane Fonda, and her husband Tom
Hayden, where they could work to promote the North Vietnamese agitprop
programme. These two persons gave lectures in the Capitol itself, attended by at
least sixty Congressional aides. A group of thirty-five of these aides formed the
Capitol Hill Coordinating Committee, whose purpose was to end all aid to South
Vietnam.
52. Sharp, Strategy for Defeat, Vietnam in Retrospect, pp. 256-258 has an account of
what is meant by 'the will to win', as related by an American Navy pilot, prisoner in
the 'Hanoi Hilton' for seven years:
If our escalation, our creeping up the panhandle with graduated bombing
raids, our bombing pauses, conveyed any message to the enemy, it was lack of
commitment. The guards were wide-eyed and particularly hostile after the
raid, but the city was back to normal within minutes. The street sounds picked
up, patriotic music bleated trom
the speakers at
every corner,
The
interrogators strutted about the prison yards defiantly. By nightfall an almost
carnival atmosphere could be sensed. Songfests went off as scheduled in the
guards' quarters and in the city parks.
.. So it was in the latter half of'66, '67,
68 till the bombing stopped. These were the darkest days for the
prisoners- when the brutality was of the sort you've read about.
A totally contrasting atmosphere swept the city on that December night in
1972 when the raids didn't last ten minutes but went on and on— when the
B-52 columns rolled in, and the big bombs impacted and kept on impacting in
the distance
when the ground shook, and the plaster fell from the ceiling,
and the prisoners cheered wildly, and the guards cowered in the lee of the
walls, cheeks so ashen you could detect it even from the light from the fiery
sky. Some of this light was from the burning B-52s (I'm told that the losses
were almost as predicted-low, but the important fact was that they kept
coming). This was commitment. This was victory for the United States, and
doomsday for North Vietnam, and we knew it and they knew it. By day,
interrogators and guards would enquire about our needs solicitously. The
streets were silent.
The centre of Hanoi was dead even though like our
prisons, thousands of yards from the drop zones. We knew the bombers knew
where we were,
and felt not only ecstatically happy, but confident. The
Vietnamese didn't. Night after night the planes kept coming in—and night
after night the SAMs streaking through the sky were fewer and fewer (the
naval blockade worked). The shock was there-
-the commitment was there-
the enemy's will was broken. You could sense it in every Vietnamese face.
They knew they lived through last night, but they also knew that if our forces
moved their bomb line over a few thousand yards they wouldn't live through
tonight. Our planes were transmitting the message of the utter futility of
further resistance.
