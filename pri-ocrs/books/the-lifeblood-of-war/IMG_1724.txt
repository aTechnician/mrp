used, as was the railway. Although, on one occasion, the bridges on a
section of the east coast line were washed away, necessitating truck
companies ferrying 2,500 tons a day across a sixteen mile gap. As the
Allies advanced, the damage to the railways referred to earlier, was
increasingly extensive, so that by summer 1944, for example, 8th Army
was 200 miles in advance of its railhead. During the Anzio battle, a
ferry service by 40 landing ships (tank) (LST), and a mix of 1, 700 3-ton
and 10-ton trucks ran from Naples to the beachhead. Every day, 300
trucks were loaded into LSTs, 50 to each ship. The loads carried in the
trucks was divided 60 per cent ammunition and 20 per cent supplies

unloaded, and returned empty in the LSTs.17
