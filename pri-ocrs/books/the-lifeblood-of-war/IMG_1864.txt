Army Supplies and
Transport, Vol. I, p. 221. The initial troop allocation in the Assault Convoy was:
Algiers
Two platoons of 3-ton trucks for temporary beach maintenance (i.e. moving
stores off the beach), then to Philippeville and Bone when relieved.
Two platoons of 6-ton trucks for port maintenance at Algiers.
Two platoons, less three sections, of tipper trucks, to carry fuel for the airfield,
unen to be emploved on road and arheld repair.
One platoon of ambulances.
One Bailey Bridge platoon.
Bougie
One platoon of 3-ton trucks for temporary beach and port maintenance.
Arriving on D + 4:
One platoon of the Armoured Brigade Transport Company.
One Bailey Bridge platoon.
One troop carrying company.
One tank transporter company.
One platoon, less two sections, ambulance car company.
Une platoon water truck company.
One heavy anti-aircraft regiment company.
The above would constitute the total planned transport for the force until the third
convoy due on D + 14 or 18 arrived.
Petrol, oil and lubricants (POL) was allowed for as follows:
MT spirit (petrol)
galls/veh/day
Derv (diesel)
50 galls/tank or AFV/day
Lubricants
0% of total petrol or diesel
45 days reserves were to be built up by D + 90. Thereafter there would be a
Ould up to 60 days reserves.
At this stage in the war, the British Army was still using the old fashioned petrol
tins instead of the 'Jerrican' which was to prove so successful later. The former were
so flimsy that when stowed in ships in stacks more than 12 feet high they crushed,
and leaked. Some ships arrived in North African ports with cans stacked up to
50 feet high, having leaked up to 40 per cent of the contents, and the holds many
¡eet deep in petrol. Up to a further 25 per cent was lost in transit from these cans
The losses from leakage
vas not only hazardous, but also very wasteful of
transport effort (S. & T., Vol. 1, p. 233). Lieutenant-General Sir Francis Tuker
Approach to Battle (Cassell 1973), p. 17, as commander of 4th Indian Dvision in
8th Army assessed that about 50 per cent of fuel carried in these ineffective cans was
lost in transit.
10. Movements, p. 372, claims that the beaches used in Normandy were the worst ever
for a combined operation from the point of view of the beach gradient. Because of
this, fully laden
stores ships had to remain up to five miles offshore, which resulted
in considerable turn-round times for ferry craft and amphibians (DUK Ws). The

airfields.
.. valuable aid in the form of the US 316th Troop Carrier Command, with
its admirable DC-3s, the famous Dakotas which were to transform Allied air
transport problems. It was impossible to carry the grossly inefficient standard
British four-gallon commercial tin inside an aircraft (see Note 9 above). The
alternative was 44 gallon steel drums, but the RAF did not have the carrying
capacity for these.
The Dakotas could do it, and did, to the tune
130,000 gallons lifted for the Desert Air Force for the El Agheila operation in
mid-December, and 153,000 gallons of petrol as well as 9,500 gallons of oil
lifted to Marble Arch landing ground alone during December and January-
the equivalent of the total tank capacity of 1,575 Hurricanes, or 1,240
Kittyhawks, or 355 Bostons (aircraft types used in close support of 8th
Army)'.
The lessons learned by 8th Army and the Desert Air Force about army/air co-
operation took some time to be hoisted in by their counterparts planning and
operating at the other end of the North African littoral.
The Germans, however, were well ahead of the Allies in the techniques of supply
by air. Terraine, p. 751:
In January
(1942) when
Rommel launched his counter-offensive,
the
Luftwaffe had only enough fuel for two weeks offensive operations. "Had not
air transport carried enough fuel to meet daily consumption, the GAF units
would have been grounded within a fortnight" (Air Historical Branch/II/
117/8(B) pp. 290-291). "Even after the attacks from Malta upon the sea route
to North Africa had dwindled to almost nothing, the Germans made great use
of their numerous transport aircraft to carry men and stores from Crete to
Cyrenaica". (Playfair, Official History, The Mediterranean and the Middle
East (HMSO, 1954)? See also Note 12.
Thanks to flawed tactical and strategic thinking in The Royal Air Force before the
Second World War, cogently portrayed by Terraine in The Right of the Line, the
British possessed nothing to compare with German or American air transports.
12. Terraine, op. cit., p. 115. As far back as the invasion of Norway, in 1940, the
Germans had shown how they outstripped the British in the bold and imaginative
use of air transport.
For the initial invasion the Luftwaffe deployed 500 combat aircraft and
another 571 Ju 52/3M transports. It was the latter which brought in the six
companies of airborne troops who captured the Norwegian capital with its
250,000 inhabitants; it was Ju 52s again which dropped the 120 paratroops
who captured Stavanger aerodrome shortly before eight o'clock on the
morning of the first day. By that evening, 180 Ju 52s arriving with clock-work
regularity, had touched down in Stavanger. In the course of the whole
campaign (but their chief use was in the early stages) these invaluable aircraft
flew 3,018 sorties, carrying 29,280 personnel, 259,300 imperial gallons of fuel
and 2,376 tons of supplies? Quoting William Green, Warplanes of the Third
