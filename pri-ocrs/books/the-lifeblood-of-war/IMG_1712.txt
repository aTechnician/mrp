The Lifeblood of War
Conclusion
The First World War was a watershed in military logistics. No
longer was it true to say that supply was easier when armies kept on the
move, because when they stopped they quickly exhausted food and
fodder, fuel for the prime movers and fighting machines, animals and
men. From 1914, the reverse applied, the reason; the huge expenditure
of ammunition, and the consequent expansion of transport to lift it
forward to the consumers; the most voracious being the artillery. A
moving army, even with the arrival of the motorised vehicle, was now
much more difficult to supply. The resources of industrialised nations
could manufacture the massive quantities of material required for
modern war in a surprisingly short time. The major problem was
maintaining the flow of supplies forward, and this was greatly
aggravated when the customers were advancing.
