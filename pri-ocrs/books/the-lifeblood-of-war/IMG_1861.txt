S. Clausewitz, On War, pp. 337-338. The allusion to a 'G. Snob' dates from the old
British Army staff system (pre-dating NATO standardisation) by which oper-
ations staffs at all levels above battalion or regiment, were part of the General (G)
staff, hence Major General Staff, heading the operations branch at army level,
Brigadier General Staff at corps, General Staff Officer Grade One, a lieutenant
colonel, at division, to the General Staff Officers Grades Two and Three, majors
and captains at all levels; who did all the
work; so they claimed.
The
Quartermaster General's branch were responsible for administration, and the
Adjutant General's branch for personnel. Each had their own hierarchy of Vice
Quartermaster General, Vice Adjutant General, Deputy, Assistant, and Deputy
Assistant, down to brigade where one officer combining both administrative and
personnel functions,
rejoiced in
the
title
Deputy
Assistant
Adjutant and
Quartermaster General.
At all levels,
from
brigade to army, there were Staff
Captains, who, according to them, did most of the work.
A 'G. Snob' was an
operations officer who took no account of logistics in his planning, or affected a
disdain of such mundane matters as supply.
