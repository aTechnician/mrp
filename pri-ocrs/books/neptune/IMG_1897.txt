CHAPTER 1
GERMANY FIRST
HE PHONE RANG AT 1:47 IN THE AFTERNOON, Washington time,
just after President Franklin D. Roosevelt had finished his lunch of
soup and sandwiches in the Oval Study on the second floor of the White
House. A lifelong collector of stamps from around the world, Roosevelt
had a standing agreement with the State Department to send him the
stamps from each day's overseas mail, and he was just opening the most
recent batch when the phone rang, Harry Hopkins, the former director of
the Works Progress Administration who lived in the White House as Roo-
sevelt's close personal advisor, was there, too, but it was Roosevelt who
reached across the desk to pick up the phone. The White House operator
told him that Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox was on the line insisting
that he talk with the president. "Put him on" Roosevelt said.
Knox wasted no time on formalities. "Mr. President, it looks like the
Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor."
Roosevelt slammed the palm of his left hand down on the desk top with
a loud bang. "No!" he shouted.!
