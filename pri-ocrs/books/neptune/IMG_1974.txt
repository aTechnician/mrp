vessel of the Second World War—the Liberty ship. For much of the war,
Liberty ships carried the munitions and supplies that kept Britain and Rus-
sia in the war and sustained Allied trade and Allied operations worldwide.
Before the war was over, American shipyards would turn out more than
twenty-seven hundred of them.24
At 14,500 tons each, Liberty ships were more than three times larger
than LSTs, and they were voracious consumers of steel plate. Back in
February 1942, Roosevelt had challenged retired Rear Admiral Emory
Scott Land, who ran the Maritime Commission, to build eight million
tons of shipping that year, and ten million tons more in 1943. These were
audacious numbers; in 1941, even with the spur provided by the govern-
ment's subsidy program, the American shipbuilding industry had pro-
duced a total of only 1.1 million tons of shipping. Now FDR wanted
eighteen times that. It is not clear where he got the numbers; he may
have simply plucked them out of the air to impress Land with the impor-
tance of building as many ships as he could as fast as possible. At the
time, both Land and his deputy, Rear Admiral Howard Vickery, believed
achieving such a goal was unlikely. Nevertheless, with a Herculean effort,
by 1943 Land and Vickery seemed to be on their way to accomplishing
it. At that point, Roosevelt raised the bar, setting a new objective of
twenty-four million tons. His attitude seemed to be: If you achieved the
goal I set, I must not have set it high enough. Such astonishing levels of pro-
ductivity, however, absorbed unprecedented amounts of raw materials,
especially steel plate, and that affected the renewed effort to build LSTs.
As the 1944 War Production Board report put it, "Competition among
various agencies of the Armed Services for available material was keen."
That competition also involved machine tools, electric motors, welding
rods, generators, reduction gears, bearings, pumps, and hundreds of
other vital components. Despite Americ's role as the "Great Arsenal of
Democracy" (Roosevelt's term), it was a zero-sum game after all: one
more Liberty ship might well mean one, two, or even three, fewer LSTS.
The competition for resources between landing craft and other con-
struction projects demonstrated that American industrial capacity was
not infinite 25
