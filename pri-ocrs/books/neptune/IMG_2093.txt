Moon's daughter remembered that it was a family mantra "to always do one's best."
Meredith Moon to the author, May 15, 2013, author's collection. Long after Moon's
death, a trunk containing his old check stubs was discovered in an Annapolis home
that was being demolished. It may or may not illustrate Moon's meticulous attention
to detail that every cancelled check had been carefully reattached to the stub.

baseball game between British and American sailors, Moon was watching from a dis-
tance when an errant ball bounced near him. He ran to it, picked it up, and threw it
back into the field of play. The British sailors were stunned that an admiral would
condescend so much. No British admiral, they asserted, would do such a thing.

Assault on Normandy, 12. There is circumstantial evidence that Moon pres
to do something about the threat from Cherbourg. After the war, both
Lewis and Mark Dalton, who served on Moon's staff, remembered Moor
to neutralize the E-boat threat from Cherbourg. It is not clear if Kirk ad
sponse to this prodding from Moon or on his own. In addition, Strauss
the British officer Struble talked to as Vian, but Vian had no authority to
command boundaries, and it was very likely Ramsay that Struble talke
