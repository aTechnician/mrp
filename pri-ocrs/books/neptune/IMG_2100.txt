8. John R. Lewis Jr. Oral History, NWWIIM-EC, 7. Moon's note is from Meredith
Moon Collection. See also Alter, "My Dear Moon." Officially, the cause of Moon's
death was "a gunshot wound to the head that was self-inflicted during a period of
insanity which was the direct result of overwork and mental fatigue incident to plan-
ning and executing combat operations against the enemy." Since then, some have
speculated that in addition to the overwork, Moon could also have suffered from a
physical malady. The near miss of the German bomb off Utah Beach (see Chap-
ter 13) could have caused an undiagnosed internal brain hemorrhage. If so, the slow
seepage of blood into his brain would have caused Moon periodic intense pain and
confusion- or, as the Navy report put it, "a period of insanity. Moon's daughter,
who was ten at the time of her father's death and who later became a clinical psy-
chologist, believes that this may well have contributed to her father's desperate
action on August 5, 1944.
