The ocean voyage was memorable, indeed unforgettable, for virtually all
of them, though in quite different ways. Shipping remained an enormous
problem for the Allies, and in recognition of that Churchill offered the use
of "the Queens"- Britain's large passenger steamers, including the Queen Mary
and the Queen Elizabeth. These magnificent ships, one completed in 1936,
the other in 1940, had been designed to carry two thousand passengers,
Brits and Yanks = 125
cosseted by a crew of just under a thousand, in hotel-style luxury. Refitted
for war use, they carried far more men in far less comfort. On early trips
they carried six thousand men per crossing. That was soon increased to ten
thousand, and then to fifteen thousand, which meant that the accommo-
dations were Spartan indeed. To make room for everyone, the crew drained
the swimming pools and used it as deck space. The soldiers slept in canvas
bunks attached to metal frames that were stacked four deep along the bulk-
heads. Worse, they were "double-bunked," or what was sometimes called
"hot bunking" which meant that a soldier got possession of a sleeping
space for a twelve-hour period, then had to give it up to another man for the
next twelve hours. The officers got cabins, though instead of the four peo-
ple the cabins had been designed to accommodate, each now housed six-
teen to twenty. Often half of them slept in the cabin while the others made
do in the passageways rolled up in blankets; the next night they switched
places. The heat and the stale air led some to carry their blanket up to the
forward deck to sleep in the chill weather topside. Others slept on the mess
tables In spite of that, those assigned to one of the "Queens" counted them-
selves lucky, because the ships were fast—at twenty-five knots, they were
too fast for a German U-boat to track them. That meant they could sail
ingly without escort, and cross the Atlantic in five days?
Most Americans came over in much slower troop transports that had to
sil as part of a convoy, moving at the speed of the slowest ship — generally
at ten knots or less That not only made them more vulnerable to the
Uboats but also meant spending three weeks or more at sea. A typical
top convoy consisted of between twenty and thirty transport ships or-
ganized into eight, nine, or ten columns of three or four ships each, consti-
ting a formation that might be five or six miles wide. The ships followed
one another at relatively close intervals— a thousand yards or less. Even at
such close quarters, it was difficult to maintain station blacked out at night
or in the North Atlantic fog, when it became almost impossible for an of-
Sierof the deck to see the ship directly in front of him. Foghorns sounding
from several directions at once provided an imperfect guide to officers who
sought to stay in formation while avoiding a collision. In such circum-
sances, ships would deploy what was called a "sea sled," a device towed
