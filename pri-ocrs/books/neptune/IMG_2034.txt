IS
289
One of the Allied landing rehearsals turned tragic in April of 1944 when German
Schnellbooten, literally fast boats, though often called S-boats or E-boats by the Allies,
attacked a convoy of ISTs heading for Slapton Sands during Exercise Tiger. The E-boats
macke a cosio ov ST acing ter adron se another. The .ST 289, seen here, was
badly mauled when a torpedo struck its stern. The 289 managed to make it back into
port but could not be repaired in time for the invasion. The loss of three LSTs this late
in the planning was a severe blow. (U.S. Naval Institute)
A group of ISTs loads an artillery unit across a "hard" at Brixham, just north of
Dartmouth, on June 1, 1944. Seen here are LSTs 382, 499, 384, and 380. The 499 was
destroyed by a German mine off the invasion beaches on June 8. (U.S. Naval Institute)
The Allied bombardment
of the target beaches
began at 5:36 a.m. on
June 6. Here guns of
the American battleship
Nevada (BB-36) fire on
Utah Beach. In just over
an hour, the Nevada fired
337 rounds of 14-inch
shells and 2,693 rounds
of S-inch shells. Other
American and Allied
ships also punished the
invasion beaches, but
only on Sword Beach
did the preliminary
bombardment by Royal
Navy warships have a
significant effect. (U.S.
