evident in the five days before the Mulberry opened for business: that while
the Mulberry project was unquestionably a testament to Anglo-American,
and especially British, imagination, creativity, and determination, it was
not, after all, essential to the maintenance of the Allied invasion."

enacuate casualties because that was likely to slow their turnaround time
and thereby risk the rapid and continuous delivery of reinforcements and
supplies. That may have been a ploy to demonstrate how important it was
toincrease LST availability, because for the actual invasion a number of
LSTs were specially staffed with Navy doctors and pharmacist's mates to
take care of casualties. A few ships even had ersatz operating rooms. Ves-
selso equipped performed a kind of shuttle service, carrying troops and
vehicles in one direction and wounded men in the other. 42
There were so many wounded men on Omaha Beach that first day that
relatively few could be evacuated at all. Far too many had to survive one or
even two cold nights lying on the sand. As the soldiers fought their way
inland and the threat of German artillery was reduced, the Allies estab-
lished aid stations on the beaches. For the first several days, these were little
more than foxholes with sandbag walls and a canvas roof, but at least the
Nary pharmacist's mates who manned them had bandages and (critically)
morphine. Many of the wounded were assisted down to the aid stations by
their buddies. Others arrived in specially configured ambulance trucks,
modifed from the nearly ubiquitous two-and-a-half-ton Dodge trucks.
Still others were carried down from the bluffs in Stokes stretchers, a kind of
wire basket in a metal frame. Occasionally a wounded soldier staggered in
on his own. 43
Many of them were wounded psychically as well as physically. Post-
traumatic stress disorder had not yet acquired its current designation,
and the commonly used term was "battle fatigue." Whatever name it bore,
its victims were unmistakable. Pharmacist's Mate Bill Milne, off LST-491,
treated one wounded American airborne soldier who had somehow made
it down to the aid station unassisted. He had parachuted out over enemy
territory in the middle of the night, endured conditions that only he knew
for certain, and though he had been shot through the leg, he had neverthe
less walked all the way to Omaha Beach. By the time he arrived at the aic
station, he was a grisly apparition, and Milne saw at once that he was in
shock. "He had his .45 in one hand, and a combat knife in the other," Milne
recalled. "I remember specifically that we could not get his pistol or knife
away from him until we had given him morphine." Survivors of sinkings
