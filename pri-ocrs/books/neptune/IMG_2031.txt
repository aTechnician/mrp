One of Eisenhower's
great assets as an Allied
commander was his
deftness in dealing with
political issues. In North
Africa, however, he found
himself overmatched
by the complexity of
French wartime loyalties
and rivalries. Unable to
convince French General
Henri Giraud to embrace
a public role as an ally,
he made an arrangement
with French Admiral Jean
François Darlan, a former
Nazi collaborator. Here,
Ike appears to regret his
decision as a pleased
Darlan looks on.

Another aspect of
Eisenhower's leadership
was his ready smile, which
Rear Admiral Morton Deyo
believed was worth twenty
divisions. Here he reacts to
a witticism from Churchill,
who worked unceasingly
ta convince Hisenhower to
extend Allied operations ir
the Mediterranean through
1943. In the end, Churchill
got his way, though it was
as much the momentum of
events as Churchill's charm
and persistence that led the
Allies into Sicily and Italy.
