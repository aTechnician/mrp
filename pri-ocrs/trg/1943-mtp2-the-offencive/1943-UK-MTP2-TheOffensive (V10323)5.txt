PART I-GENERAL PRINCIPLES
CHAPTER 1
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
1. INTRODUCTION
1. The one object of war is to destroy or neutralize the
enemy armed power so completely that he is obliged to bend
to the will of his opponent and comply with the terms
demanded.
2. The resources with which a belligerent power can wage
war are not confined to those of the armed services, but in-
clude also those that enable the means of life of the enemy
populace, and their will to endure the privations and hardships
of war, to be curtailed or undermined by economic, propaganda,
or other methods. It is the task of the government of a nation
at war to employ all the resources available in such a way as
to enable the initiative to be maintained, or regained with the
least possible delay should the enemy have taken it initially,
since it is only by possession of the initiative and by vigorous
offensive action that victory can de won.
2. MAIN PRINCIPLES
3. The principles of war which mainly apply to offensive
operations are maintenance of the object, surprise and mobility,
concentration, and co-operation.
The object
4. The ultimate military object is to destroy the enemy
armed forces as soon as is possible. When the enemy is a well-
armed and highly organized modern state, it will usually be
necessary to reduce his available manpower and to seize or
destroy a large proportion of his industrial resources before he
will admit defeat.
