39. THE PURSUIT
235. The armoured division after successful battle will,
within the intention of the higher commander's orders, pursue
the enemy relentlessly.
It will often be held in reserve during offensive operations
to be used for the pursuit phase.
Whether the armoured division is acting alone or forms
part of a corps of armoured divisions, it should be used to
attack enemy flanks, or vitals such as airfields, communica-
tions, or administrative echelons well in rear of the enemy
front, and thus carry out parallel as opposed to direct pursuit.
In pursuit greater risks can generally be taken, and it may
be permissible for the two brigades to be out of supporting
distance of each other for short periods.
236. Partial decentralization of administration will gener-
ally be necessary. Brigades may have to be made self-support-
ing for several days, their second line administrative units
remaining under their control, and additional petrol and
ammunition detachments being placed under their command.
237. The operations of the armoured division will be assisted
to the utmost by the offensive action of air forces.
PART III
THE MIXED AND INFANTRY DIVISIONS
CHAPTER 9
PRINCIPLES OF EMPLOYMENT
40. CHARACTERISTICS
238. The mixed division.-The offensive power of this
division lies, to a large extent, in the hitting power of the tank
brigade.
The choice of routes for movement may be largely restricted
because of the heavy loads in the division, including the tanks
whether moved on transporters or not.
Owing to the great divergence in speed of the vehicles in
the division accurate staff work is necessary to ensure smooth
movement and the required dispositions for battle.
The number of infantry in the mixed division is relatively
small.
