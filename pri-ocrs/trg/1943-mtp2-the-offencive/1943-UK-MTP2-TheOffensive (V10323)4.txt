Distant reconnaissance
Reconnaissance carried out to discover the enemy's
strategical movements and concentrations in a theatre of
operations. Normally carried out from the air.

about the enemy's movements and dispositions on which to
base a plan of offensive or defensive action.

which a higher formation will move.
Centre line
The route along which a formation, unit, or sub-unit head-
quarters will move.
Bound
A tactical feature of importance which may be used in an
advance to co-ordinate movement. Having reached a bound,
the unit or formation will continue without delay unless
otherwise ordered or unless it is necessary to secure the feature
for tactical reasons.
Report line
Lines on which units or formations report but do not halt.
They have no tactical significance but should follow clearly
defined features such as lateral roads, rivers, or railways.
Group

specified, with the addition of other arms under command as
required for a specific operation, e.g., brigade, regimental,
company group.
(The term "
combat team " will not be used, owing to risk
of confusion.)
Start line
The line from which, at a specified time, assaulting troops
advance to attack. It should follow a clearly defined feature
and be nearly at right angles to the direction of attack.
