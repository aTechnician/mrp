30. CONCLUSION
200. To summarize, the following rules govern the employ-
ment of an armoured division :
(a) The division will always operate as one fighting
machine and will not be split up.
(b) The armoured brigade will be used concentrated.
(c) The attack by either brigade will be carried out on a
narrow front and will be supported by all the fire
power available in the division.
(d) Attack will be launched from suitable ground securely
held by infantry, artillery, and anti-tank guns, from
which good observation
is possible. This is the
pivot, which provides support and protection for
the armoured brigade.
CHAPTER 7
THE APPROACH
31. GENERAL
201. The main consideration during the tactical approach
is that the armoured division should not drift into battle, or
become involved in a major fight piecemeal and without a
definite plan.
The division must always be so disposed that action on a
co-ordinated plan can be carried out rapidly, and suitable
dispositions for battle adopted with minimum delay.
32. RECONNAISSANCE
202. Air reconnaissance will normally be supplied by one or
more tactical reconnaissance squadrons working under corps
or army control. Divisions must keep corps fully and con-
tinuously informed of their requirements and must be notified
if certain of them cannot be met. The rapid transmission to
divisions of the results of these reconnaissances is most
important.
On occasions, especially when air superiority is assured or
when an armoured division is operating at considerable
aider is e
distance from the receinder of the corps it dire be possible
for a reconnaissance squadron
divisional control.
