exercised through efficient signal communications. Adminis-
trative communications are as important as operational ones,
and, although cable may be available along main axes, reliance
must be placed largely on wireless.
92. Maintenance of wireless security is of vital importance
to ensure against information of value being gained by enemy
intercept services. Should it be necessary to impose restric-
tions on the volume of wireless traffic, it will be the more
important to make full use of liaison officers and intercom-
munication aircraft.
93. Headquarters must be well forward and sited to take
full advantage of existing communications, the state of which
must be reported early by signal reconnaissance parties.
CHAPTER 3
THE ATTACK
14. GENERAL
94. The following rules will be observed by all grades of
commander in attack :—
(a) Information must be as complete as possible, but
reconnaissances may have to be limited in order to
avoid disclosure of the plan of attack.
(b) A reconnaissance plan is always essential, and clear
• orders will be given covering the degree of reconnais-
sance necessary and the time available for it.
(c) Plans will be simple and flexible. Complicated plans
will not work in war.
(d) Whatever the scale of attack, everything possible will
be done to deceive the enemy as to the time, strength,
and place of the attack.
(e) Objectives selected will be suited to the resources avail-
able and to the state of training of the troops involved.
(f) The flanks of the attack will be adequately protected.
(8) A reserve will always be maintained to exploit success
or to deal with a counter-attack.
(h) In combined tank and infantry attacks the two arms
will never be out of supporting distance of each other,
and both arms must be supported by maximum fire.
