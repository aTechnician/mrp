CHAPTER I
RULES FOR DRAFTING ORDERS, INSTRUCTIONS,
REPORTS AND MESSAGES
7. General
1. Except when code names are used (see Sec. 22), units and
formations will be described by the authorized abbreviations
given in Appendix IV which contains also instructions for their
use. Ordinal numbers written as words will be used to denote
armies, e.g. First (Second, etc.) Army. Cardinal numbers
(written as figures) will be used to denote particular formations
or units (e.g. 1 Div (1st Division), 2 R.W.K. (2nd Battalion,
The Royal West Kent Regt.) ).
Otherwise numbers will be
written as words, e.g.: "Two med bys are placed under
comd 3 div."
When it is desired to refer to a unit or formation from which
a portion is excluded, the unit or formation will be named and
the words " less . . .
" used, e.g. :
" 2 div less two inf bdes."
" 1 RF less two coys."
2. Place, personal, code and regimental names,
and the
word " NOT " should always be written in block capitals.
3. Indefinite terms such as " dawn," " dusk," should never
be used ;
conditional terms such as " as soon as possible,"
" should,
," " may" are dangerous, and will be used only when
it is not possible to be more definite.
4. Unless otherwise stated, the time and place of arrival of
a body of troops refer to the head of the main body.
8. Date
1. All orders, instructions, reports and messages must be
dated. Dates will be written in the form " 3 Sep 39." The
names of months will be abbreviated by the use of the first
three letters.
2. A night will be described by both dates over which the
night extends, e.g. :
" night 29/30 Sep."
" night 30 Sep/1 Oct."
