APPRECIATIONS, ORDERS, INTERCOMMUNICATION
AND MOVEMENTS
CHAPTER I
APPRECIATIONS
1. Appreciations
1. An appreciation is a review of a military problem or
situation based on all available information and culminating
in a plan of the action to be taken to meet the situation. The
following sections deal primarily with tactical appreciations ;
strategical appreciations, which are likely to require special
treatment, are not fully considered.
2. Appreciations will vary from those when adequate time
is available to consider and record on paper every known or
surmised factor that may bear on the situation to those when
time is of the greatest importance and a rapid mental survey
is all that is possible.
Whenever time is available the appreciation should be
committed to paper. Even if this can be done only in the
form of brief notes it should ensure a more balanced review of
all factors than is possible from a mental summary.
3. In war, where there is an unending succession of dis-
turbing influences, a methodical consideration of the problem
will be possible only if the mind is trained to work to an
accepted sequence of thought.
Constant practice is essential, until, as a matter of habit, a
rapid review of all the facts leads logically to the formulation
of a sound plan.
4. All appreciations whether written or mental, will be in
the following accepted logical sequence :â€”
i. The object to be attained.
ii. Factors which affect the attainment of the object.
iii. Courses of action open to the writer and to the enemy.
iv. The plan.
