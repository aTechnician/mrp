one factor or to allow it to influence the appreciation towards
a definite course of action until all the others have been
considered and their combined influence summarized.
A distinction must be drawn between established facts and
assumptions since on the accuracy of the latter will depend
the soundness of the inferences drawn.
8. Other factors which may influence the attainment of the
object in an appreciation may be :—
i. Ground-which invariably has a preponderating
irfluence on all tactical operations and can never
be neglected.
ii. Time and space-an essential consideration in
practically every military operation.
iii. Weather-The importance of this factor will vary
considerably, though its influence on fire plans
which include the use of smoke can seldom be
ignored.
iv. Time of the year-The hours of daylight or, conversely,
darkness will influence considerations of surprise
and security in all operations, especially those in
which large movements of troops are concerned.
v. Phases of the moon—It will often be of importance to
consider whether any hours of complete darkness
occur after sunset, or before sunrise.
vi. Security-The need to provide a reasonable security
cannot be neglected.
vii. Communications-Supply and transport, or the lack
of them, will influence every plan.
viti. Water supply-Often of great importance in tropical
countries.
The above list is by no means exhaustive and no factor
bearing on the problem can be neglected with impunity.
9. Courses open to both forces
In considering the courses of action open to the two
opponents it will generally be desirable to take first the
courses open to that force which has the initiative.
If the courses open to the writer are taken first, the final
decision as to which is to be adopted must be left until due
