DISTRIBUTION
The list of addressees to whom copies of the orders are
issued will be included in all copies. The number of copies
should be kept as low as possible, both in the interests of
secrecy and because of the difficulties of reproduction in the
field.
The distribution list should be in the order :â€”
Own subordinate formations or units.
Attached troops.
Formations and units co-operating.
Own commander.
Own staff
Own services.
File and war diary.
Operation orders, operation instructions and administrative
orders must be immediately acknowledged by all recipients
as a matter of routine.
5. In principle, a commander's orders are issued only to
those who are required to take action on them.
Copies to
Aank formations or units will usually be issued for informatior
to ensure effective co-operation. A copy will not be sent to
the next higher formation, unless ordered or as the most
convenient means of keeping a superior in touch with the
situation.
The issue of a sufficient number of copies of a commander's
operation orders to his immediately subordinate commanders
for distribution to the formations or units under their command
should be very exceptional; but it may on occasion be
convenient to distribute appendices (see para. 6, below)
containing long or complicated arrangements which would
otherwise have to be repeated in the orders of lower
formations.
A subordinate commander who issues copies of his superior's
orders without receiving permission to do so will be responsible
for having made known any information contained in them.
6. The body of the order should contain only the essential
outline of the plan and it will usually be advisable to place in
appendices such matter as details of the fire plan, or orders
to the air force or reconnoitring troops.
