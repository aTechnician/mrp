1. Troops embussing are organized into unit groups. When the troops are required to debus in proximity to the enemy, the composition
of transport columns should be arranged so as to preserve the tactical organization of the troops moved; otherwise the composition of unit
groups should be designed to avoid breaking up the organization of transport units.
A unit group may therefore consist of a unit or portion of
a unit, or may comprise portions of two or more units. Each unit group is allotted a serial number in the Table, and its commander detailed
in column (a).
The buses or lorries in the transport column are numbered consecutively throughout, and the numbers allotted to each unit group are
shown in column (c) ; spare buses or lorries are unnumbered.
The exact detail of stores to be embussed must be shown in column (e).
