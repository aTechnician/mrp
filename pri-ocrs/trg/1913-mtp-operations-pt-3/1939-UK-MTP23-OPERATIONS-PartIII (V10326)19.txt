the action of the recipient of the order. A higher commander's
intention will be repeated in the orders of subordinates only
when, and so far as, it is essential to do so.
In the interests of secrecy, it will often be advisable to
include it in the order in outline only ; the intention may then
be amplified separately, either verbally or in writing.
INTENTION
A clear,
concise and decisive statement of what the
commander intends to achieve. The intention stated should
not exceed what is to be effected by the plan embodied in the
order, and should normally be drafted by the commander
himself ; it
should be expressed in the future imperative
tense, i.e. " will." Alternative intentions depending on
developments should not be given in operation orders.
METHOD
A statement of the tasks allotted to formations or units, in
sufficient detail to ensure co-operation.
ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS
A statement of the general administrative arrangements so
far as all recipients of the order require to know them.
It may be convenient to issue details of administrative
arrangements separately, either as an appendix or in
administrative orders.
INTERCOMMUNICATION

communication, e.g. iâ€”
Location of headquarters.
Routes to be followed by headquarters of subordinate
formations.
Liaison duties.
Orders for wireless silence or other restrictions on the use
of wireless.
