CHAPTER II
ORDERS
2. Types of orders
1. Standing orders
The object of standing orders is to adapt existing regulations
to local conditions, and to avoid repetition in routine and
operation orders.
Standing orders are of a more permanent nature than routine
orders, and must be confined to essentials which are not liable
to alteration. They should contain nothing which contradicts
existing regulations, nor should repetition of such regulations
be included.
2. Routine orders
The object of routine orders is to ensure wide publicity for
matters of general administrative interest, thereby reducing
correspondence and the duplication of returns.
issued by the a se prep A by si branche i su the sta fixed
distribution list and on a wide scale, in order to reduce to a
minimum the necessity for repetitions in the orders of
subordinate formations.
Routine orders are designated by the title of the formation
from which they emanate, those issued by G.H.Q. being
entitled " General routine orders," and those by an army
headquarters " Army routine orders." In each formation
routine orders will be numbered consecutively, each subsequent
issue continuing the serial numbers.
Alihough subordinate commanders should normally refrain
from repeating extracts of orders received frcm higher
formations in their own orders, an exception may be made
in the case of important routine orders, which, to ensure a
fuller distribution, may be published in the routine orders of
subordinate formations and units. Where it is essential in
the opinion of a superior that a routine. order should be
republished in this manner, he will so order it in the text of
the routine order concerned.
Routine orders will be issued in place of circular letters
wherever applicable.
