be giveu every consideration so long as this does not endanger
the safety of the column. The R.A.S.C. officer will therefore
be responsible for general march discipline, for regulating the
cruising speed, for technical control and for dealing with
break-downs.
The column commander will give the order for
embussing and debussing.
He and his officers will be
responsible for taking action on meeting an obstruction and
for action in the event of a tactical emergency. A sufficient
number of officers must be detailed to travel in the column to
carry out these duties.
The column commander and the R.A.S.C. officer in command
of the transport should travel in the same car or in cars
following each other, as should also unit commanders with
their respective mechanized transport section commanders.
For other points in march discipline see Appendix IX.
After the personnel have debussed and the vehicles have
moved clear of the debussing point, the R.A.S.C. officer in
command of the transport if still under command of the
formation or unit will remain with the headquarters concerned
ready to receive his orders.
5. Mechanized transport which already has a definite
purpose should be employed for the carriage of marching
personnel only in circumstances of extreme urgency. The
normal functioning of the administrative services may be
upset, great discomfort caused, and troops may even become
divorced from their weapons.
For this latter reason it is essential that men carried in
improvised transport should be accompanied by sufficient
arms and ammunition to enable them to fight at once in an
emergency.
