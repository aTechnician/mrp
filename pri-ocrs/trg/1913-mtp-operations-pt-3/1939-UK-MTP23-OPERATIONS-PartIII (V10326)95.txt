10. The rate of marching throughout a column should be
uniform; an irregular pace is most exhausting, especially to
the troops in rear of the column.
If distances are lost, stepping out, doubling or trotting to
regain them is forbidden, except by order of the unit com-
mander. Infantry will only be ordered to quicken its pace if
a defile is to be passed or some definite object is to be gained.
11. On a halt being ordered, all troops will at once halt and
fall out clear of the road. Dismounted troops will remove
their equipment (except respirators, or other protective
equipment), and mounted troops will dismount and loosen
girths; riding horses' heads will be turned towards the space
left clear for passing traffic. Cross-roads must be left clear.
12. No compliments will be paid during a march on service,
unless specially ordered.
