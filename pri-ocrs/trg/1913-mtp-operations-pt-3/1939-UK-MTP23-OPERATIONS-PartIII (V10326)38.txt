In mobile formations and units, large groups are often
necessary. This requires a very high degree of training among
operators and among officers using R/T. In such formations
and units the sending of orders and information by officers by
R/T will be the normal practice, and it is therefore essential
that these officers should have a thorough knowledge of the
procedure for using R/T in a group of stations. (See Signal
Training, All Arms, 1938, Sec. 93.)
