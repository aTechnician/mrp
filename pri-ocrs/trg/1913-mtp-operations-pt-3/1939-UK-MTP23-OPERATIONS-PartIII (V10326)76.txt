APPENDIX VI
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ALLOTMENT
OF CODE NAMES IN THE FIELD
Responsibility for allotment
1. The general staff (Intelligence Branch) is responsible for
the allotment of code names for the use of formations and units
in the field force, including units of the R.A.F. component.
2. Since the general use of code names is chiefly confined
to divisional areas (see Sec. 22), it follows that there will
be many non-divisional units in back areas to which the
allotment of code names will be unnecessary. Should any
such unit be moved into a divisional area, the formation
ordering the move will ensure that the unit is allotted a code
name from spares unallotted in the corps troops or divisional
list concerned.
3. Code names will be allotted to the headquarters, rear
headquarters and signal centres of corps, divisions, cavalry
and tank brigades; to infantry brigade H.Q. and
to their
signal centres if necessary. Code names may be allotted to
the headquarters R.A., R.E., and R.A.S.C., and services when
the volume of traffic justifies it. Clear and code names will
however NEVER be used together.
In the case of the following units they will be allotted as
under :â€”
Cavalry and Royal Armoured Corps down to Squadrons and
Companies.
Royal Artillery
Batteries.
Royal Engineers
Companies.
Infantry Battalions
Companies
(Armoured
Division

Machine Gun Battalions
Machine
Gun
Companies.
Royal Army Service Corps
Companies
and
Columns.
Royal Army Medical Corps
Field
Ambulances.
In all other units code names will be allotted to the head-
quarters only. If considered essential code names may in
exceptional circumstances be allotted to individual officers
from the spare names available.
