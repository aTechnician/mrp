SITUATION 6. .
-. Object.
To drive
the enemy back with as little delay as
possible,
thus helping the Left 0olumn
get on.
2. Enemy appears to
be holding a commanding position in
strength,
but it is
unlikely
that he has
carried out
extensive defence works.
3. One doy. of my Tos. is deployed across my whole front and
been held up by fire.
One M:G. 21. has been in action
the right is practicelly on the
the left in close touch with
Left column.
Tho flanks
reasonably secure.
The ground between my
enemy consists of a
and observation for developing covering fire for an attack.
the forward slope on my side of the valley has little cover.
I shall therefore have to
develop maximum covering fire while
troons are noving down this slope.
A small stream at
bottom of the valloy, Tout an obstacle to men, but possibly
will be to wheeled
5. Distando to bottom of valley
about 400 yas.
Distance from
botion of valley to
enemy F.D.Ls about 500 yds.
I shall therefore want covering fire for about 15 minutes,
with the maximum for first 8 minutes.
The front is about 1500 yàs.
It will be a great advantage to both colns. if we arrange
to attack siml taneously.
6. The eneny may be occupying this position only as a delaying
action,
or he may fight it out here.
There is not
sufficient information to be certain which he is
going to do,
but there are indications that he will make a determined
stand.
7. I could attack on a one Coy
left flank.
the enemy would, however, be able to bring
the bulk of his fire
to bear
I could attack on a two doy front.
enemy to dispose his fire, siving both my coln. and
left coln, nore chance of suscess.
I could attack on a three Coy front. This would entail
having tho whole Coln, in the fight at once. I should
refer to koen a coy
in hand.
shall
therefore attaok on a two Coy front.
SITUATION 5
The Right Forward Coy, of the attack reaches
CONNETTS position, when it is counter-attacked
of Tanks from
the trees about 426911 (to be pointed out
on the ground) •
PROBLEM 5
As 0.C.
Right Coy. how do you think this action would
be dealt with ?
D.S. NOIRS - PROBLEM 5.
A/T guns under command would be moving up and would
not, therefore, be in action.
The supporting gun in rear could see and would
fire.
All Pl. A/T rifles should be brought to bear.
fire makes it very difficult for Tanks to see
as they must then keep their
vizors closed.
