(2) ARTETTERY IN ATTACK.
Preliminary measures.
Guns sited well forward so as to
support to maximum depth with min-
imum of

Artillery Plan.
Consists
of fire plan,

control,

Give and take between various
Arms may be necessary.
From the Artillery point of view
espocially
the mein outline of
the
Plan is required as early as
possiblo because on that outline
the arrangements for deployment
will
depend.
Details can
be arranged by
Sub-
ordinate Commanders
or modified
without affecting the main dis-
positions.
Simplicity of plan essential.
Artillery orders may be
necessary on a large number of
polats - vide A 7. III, Appendix |
