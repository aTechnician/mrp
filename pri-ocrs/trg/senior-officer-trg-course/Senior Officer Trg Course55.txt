Own Troops:
The 6 Inf. Bde. are holding strong positions
N.W. of
the enemy line.
Some of
the
enemy
dispositions are known and
there should be
available good information about ground in
front.
Two Arty. Bdes. and 7 Med. Bty. have
already been firing on the front and
the bulk of the
targets must by now have
been registered.
COURSES OPIN.
To Us.
To stage a noisy attack on a quiet attack
If a noisy attack is started
will put down his counter-preparation
and defensive fire.
As a result all
eliment of surprise will be lost.
In any case I do not consider I have
supporting fire to
cover more then
in a noisy attack because
siderable support will
wanted on the
front, and
especially the flanks of the
advance to deal with enemy M.Gs.
To the Imemy:
To withdraw from the salient.
Very
unlikely as FASTLAND would lose her
advantage of a quick mobilization, by
delay at this time.
To further exploit success by advanc-
ing and clearing us out of our defensive
position as early as possible - Enemy
will probably do this.
Meantime he will certainly adjust his
present day dispositions as soon as it
is dark so as to strengthen his position
and in addition he will probably wire
and dig.
I must have time for my own preparations
after dark and should be ready by 2000
hrs.
Troops and avering
fire will therefore
be available to
cover my forming up
positions
and assist
the advance by pro-
tecting my flanks.
Deductions
I can therefore ex-
peat good
support with
the minimum of
registration so that
secrecy can be main-
tained.
I therefore decide
to have a
"Quiet".
attack
I should therefore
allow him as little
time as possible.
Therefore the best
time for me to
attack is about
2000 hrs. a quiet
attack on both key
positions.
