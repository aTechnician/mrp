observation.
Normal method of ranging is
"braoketing".
Degree of
ranging is dependent
on nature of target.
Fire controlled by ground obser-
vation under good conditions is
quiok and accurate.
Air observation.
Two methods of ranging :-

Range by
Bty, uses horizontal
clock and corrects to centre of
clock each time.
"O.E."
Call.
Special for great
accuracy.
Range by single rounds
after
opening salvo.
Bty. uses
"distorted clock" and braokets.
success depends on good fire dis-
cipline in Bty, and a highly
trained observer.
