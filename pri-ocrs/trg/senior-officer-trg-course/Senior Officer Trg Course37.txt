TACTICAL EXERCISE &
NOX 26 GROVE
As the C.0. I would have expected that although march di soipline
during a me night mrch
and marching with full equipment was of course
very necossary it would hardly constitute one of the main lessons
to
be brought out in the 3n. Exercise as all this should have been
practised during Coy. Training and Bn, mrches and perfected before Co
leaving Camp;
further I would have hoped to have seen a much clearer
and less sketchy scheme,
it leaves me with an impression of vagueness
• • to hon exactly the Exercise will turn out,
and I honestly think
it a a poor effort.
Going into details :-
Special Ides.
1. I cannot reconcile
these two points :
After tea time on 11 Jul. 0.C. l Kent Rifles is Visited by the
Brigadier and later no
move to be made before dark and yet in
the
extraot for Bn. Orders, para.
8 a
substential
tea is issued
at 1630 hrs.
on the 10 Jul, they'll have forgotten about it by
the next dayll!
I quite relize it is a slip but mosa the syn-
dicate should have spotted it before

at NININCTON.
When you have been told that the following units are affiliated to
your in. during training and are located as follows :-
78(How) Bty, at MINSTER.
18 ra. Coy,
R.E. at QUEENBOROUGI,
and 5 M.G.
Pus. at INADE.
3. The G.O. called attention to the faet that a in. of Marines was in
camp at
STALI SPI ILD and were always ready to turn out a

would have felt very annoyed

and when I cannot imgine as

in your Forecast of Events there is not a single word about
crossing the river.

Did you recce, this site very carefully and consider the many
factors involved before undertaking the crossing of this river ?
not know them and it gives unnecessary work to all concerned
hunting about all over the map.
I have been mable to find HUNEYBOURNE yet :
6. In line 24, what "Bty" do you refer to in addition to the "Ta. Bty" ?
7. Under Extraot from Bn. Orders:
orfloore bolong to.
It is better to put in the names of the Units that
I presume in this case they are all Kent Rifles
except Capt. Hunt,
but as there will be a fairly wide distribution to
other Units taking part and to spectators it is better to name the
Und t s.
Why keep the Bn. at three hours notice from 1600
on 10th.
No doubt a slip on your part which should have been notioed by
you on your Syndieate before issue.
B. I notice the Adjutant wo has feiled to sten the extract is a Major.
This is rather unusual I think.
9. I see no instructions as to the time the attached troops taking part
in the Exercise are to report or where they are to report.

LO. Will you get the extra sec
of the M.G. Bn ?
If you read
the oricinal it
states 1-
"One M,C. Coy, and one A/T. Pl. are generally available".
consider you should have given the Striking Force the M.G. Coy.
Less one see. if you wanted
see. to work with the skeleton force.
11. A small point, but I think 1,000 rounds of blank per l.0. for one
exercise at the start of an.
Training when Bie, and probably Div.
Training are to follow on
is on the liberal side.
12.
The Captain of E.M.S. RINOVN is exceptionally kind and helpful in
supplying two motor launches and of these one at 0200 in the morn-
ing to enable one R.A.S.C. Offleer to view what we hope will be the
crossing of the R.

striking Force.

13. Your Tink Paper with forecast of Events is not clear.
To take only a couple of examples from it i-
(a) opposite 0100 hre. 11 Jul, in the Umpire Instructions,
they are
to note arrangements for covering fire by M,0s. and Arty.
If this refors to the advancing colum who are about to cross
the river, what can they do ?
If you refer to aotion by
skeleton Enemy they have no Arty ?
(b)
