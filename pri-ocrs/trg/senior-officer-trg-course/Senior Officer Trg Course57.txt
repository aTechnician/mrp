CONSIDERATIONS.

gives he enemy the opportunity i Stiffen
resistance and to bring up rein prements.
Ine enemy has heen slews in his mobilizatin,
and as a result, while l do not anticipate an
numediate Conutes -attach fum hier, l must not
give he tine b stage one.
(1) Topographical.
The cruntry between me and CHATHAN is
generally hilly and is well wooded, except fust
SOWTH and EAST Of CHATHAM, Where it is more
pen. Therepre, it is well sarted to delay ins
actics the enemy, and I must not five him
an opportunity to adopt such tactics.
