EXTRACTS FROM MONTHLY INTHLLIGENCE SUMMARY, MARCH, 1936
The writer in
the German
publication the. "Militar Wochenblatt"
contends
that the taotical training of the Battalion includes
main tasks :-
1. Training the Battalion to function as such in war.
2. Training in making rapid tactical decisions.
The writer does not believe that the
occasions when a Battalion
will be
on the open flank of a Force will be very frequent and
such situations are
generally unreal.
He suggests
that even though a Battalion is "en cadre" it is
quite easy.
to devise sohemes,
which will necessitate the making of
rapid tactical decisions.
Some examples illustrated by diagrams
are appended.
Examples :-

is an example of a scheme requiring independent
decision with a Battalion
supported
on both flanks.
