OBJECT.
Recapture the line NORTON GREEN FM. 2979
to
WOODGATE HOUSE 3080.
CONSIDERATIONS.
Time.
I am ordered to attack by night.
This
leaves me the choice of the following : -
Immediately after dark.
Some time during the night.
Just before dawn,
aIa must have time to
get ready after
the other hand the later I
leave it the more time the enemy will
prepare for our counter-attack
or perhaps to renew his attack.
Ground.
The enemy line OAD STREET 3180 to the
south of NORTON GREIN FARM 2979 forms a
salient on our
front which consists of
two features divided by the valley DEANS
BOTTOM 3078 - VALE COTTS. 2980.
The tops of these features NORTON GRIEN
2979 and PETT IM. 2979 on the Right
302802 on the Left are key
positions.
The approaches to these places are limited
but they are sufficient for a Bn.
in each
Sector moving to the attack in the dark.
Enemy.
The enemy now hold the salient probably
with two Bns.
and a third
Bn. possibly in
the area MAGPIE HALL. 2979 - DEANS HILL
3079.
Therefore I
decide
to attack
as soon as I
can, say, 2000
hrs.
Therefore their
capture at night
is likely to have
decisive results.
My deployment
therefore will
not be restricted.
A night attack on
two points should
embarras his handling
of Reserves and allow
me to retain the in-
itiative till after
day-light to-morrow.
