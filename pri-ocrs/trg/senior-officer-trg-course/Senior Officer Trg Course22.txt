You are second-in-command of your Bn. stationed at SHEURNESS.
Your Comnanding Officer is "O.C. Station".
He sends for you and
the following conversation takes place:-
"Whilst you were on leave we
had a T.E.W.I. on Defence.
Brigadier attendod and did not seem very pleased.
I pointed out
to him that, it was quite impossible to set a decent scheme when the
only area available was the Isle of sHippay. "
He said: "I know some C.Os who could".
I don't know what he
but I didn't like
the way he
said it.
He also said that he considered
of the Orficers of
the Garrison were somewhat stereotyped, and that we were clinging

new organization for an Inf. Bae.
The first Exorcise will take place either on 25
Not. or 10 Dec.
and I cannot allow you more than from 9.30
to 1 p.m. on
