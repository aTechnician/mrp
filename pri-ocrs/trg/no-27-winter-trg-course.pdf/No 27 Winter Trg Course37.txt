Some Notes on Acreage and Stacking Space.
-------------
Calculations for acreage for Petrol and
Lubricants will usually be based on given tonnage
figures, rather than on gallonage per vehicle.
For purposes of ready reckoning, the
following may be accepted for gross stacking areas:-
Stacking 5 high :-
2,800 tons gross to the acre.
NOTE:
The total area allotted should be not less than
10 times the stacking area required, as stacks
must be widely dispersed to reduce fire risks.
