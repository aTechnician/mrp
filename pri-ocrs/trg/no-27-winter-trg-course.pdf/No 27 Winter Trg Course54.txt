COAL-OIL PRODUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN.
Mines Department Reports Appreciable Progress in 1935.
Tho annual report of the Secretary for hines (Capt. H.F.C.
Crookshank, li.P.) is the only Official
survey of the progress
in the production of oils from British coal
The roport for 1935,
just issued, is
of groater interest than over
owing to
the stago at which this development
is reaching under the
impetus of
Tho
following
is tho information now availablo as to this source
of liquid fuels :-
Production of Light oils.
Statistics of the production of light
oils from indigenous
British Hydrocarbon Oils Production Act,
-ion of rofinod light oils,
coming within tho
statutory definition,
at gas works,
and low-tomperaturo carbonisation works, from coal,
coal tar and tar oils,
amounted to 79,000,000 gallons.
uantity about 66,000,000 gallons was refined motor spiri
including motor bonzole).
The other 13,000,000 gallons comprised
90 'g benzolo, 90'g toluole, 90's xylolo, solvent and hoavy naptha,
puro benzono, puro toluono,
puro xylone,
and a small quantity of
other rofinod products.
Thoso figures compare with a total
production in 1934 of 50,000,000 gallons
of refined light oils, of
gallons were motor benzole
and 10,000,000 gallons
were other products.
The hydrogonation plant was not in operation
The Scottish Shalc oil industry produced
some 10,200,000
of motor spirit (including naptha),
as compared with 14, 500, 0 Gallons
gallons in
The reduction is due to considerable changos which
have taken
the proportions of the various rofined products
obtainod from shalo oil.
This quantity of 10,200,000 gallons, together with tho 66,000,000
gallons montioned abovo, makos for
1935, a total of over 76,200,000
gallons of home-produced motor spirit, which compares with a total
of 54,500,000 gallons in 1934.
of tho 66,000,000 gallons of rofined motor spirit producod from
coal and coal
products,
coke ovons make the largest contribution,
viz., 26,225,000 gallons.
This was followod by an
output of
20,775,000 gallons of coal-potrol by tho hydrogenation process,
10,500,000 Gallons at tar distilling works, and 8, 500,000 gallons
at gas works.
The output of refined motor spirit from gas works increased in
1935 by 16.2 por cont., as comparod with the previous yoar.
On the
basis of coal carbonised at gas works,
those which took out the
benzolo representod 44.4 por cont.,
comparod with 37.5 per cont. in
1934.
loreover, the averago yiold of crude bonzole per
ton of
coal carbonised at gas works which extracted spirit increased from
2.02 gallons in 1974 to 2.16
gallons in 1935.
The output of rofinod motor spirit from coko ovon works
increased in 1935 by 7.5 per cont.
On the basis of coal carbonised
at coke ovens,
those which took the benzolo out of thoir gas
represonted 97.6 per cont. of the total.
