COHPARISON OF BULK AND CONTAINER DISTRIBUTION.
Principles.
1. Supply system must
be
prepared to
deliver any
quantity of petrol at
short notice.
Bulk.
Adjustment of loads
to suit
varying
requirements, can-
not be made.
Inflexible.
Container.
Can be adjusted
quite oasily.
2. System to be flexible.
3. Transport required for
carriage and distribu-
tion of petrol
which
accompanies the fight-
ing
troops must be
kept to a minimum.
Quite flexible.
Spocial types of
vehicles must be
allotted to Units.
Distribution
made
easily in
any
type of
vehicle.
4. Petrol must go to the
vehicle,
and not the
vehicle to
the petrol.
In caso of fighting
vehicles, obviously
impossible and very
slow in the cases
where it can be done.
Quite simplo -
very quick.
5. Simultaneous refuell-
ing ossential
in most
units.
6. Unite
and sub-units
may be not bo ablo
to
rofuol their vehicles
the time the petrol
is deliverod.
7. System must allow for
exchange
of
empty
spare cans,
which aro
carried
in
the
vohicle,
by filled
cans whon
necessary.
8. Vehicles carrying
petrol shoula havo
similar cross-country
performance to the
vehicles they serve.
Impossiblo.
Simplo.
Inpossible unless
large numbers of
bulk fuel carriers
are allotted.
Can be done easily
from cans.
Not possible unless
can-filling apparatue
is provided
in
forward areas.
Bulk fuel lorries
generally bad cross
country performance.
Ting can be carried
in all types of
vehicles,
or on
animals, or by hand.
9. Breakdown of petrol
carrying vehicles must
not involve the loss
of the load.
10. Reduce firo risks to
a minimum.
11: Petrol carrying
vehicles must carry
proportion of
lubricants (vide
R. A.S.C.
Irg. Vol.II
App.II) and different
grades of fuel.
12. Petrol
carrying
vehicles must not bo
liable to
breakdown
and
must be easy and
cheap
to repleen
It may be necessary
to build up reserves
of potrol.
14. Transport by rail
must be simple,
speedy
and with little risk
of fire.
Transference very
difficult,
1blo
imposs-
under certain
conditions.

Bulk
lorry,
if hit,
may lose
all

Very great risks.
Very difficult, in
any case. will
necessitate
additional
vehicles.
Bulk fuel lorries
special typo and
very expensive.
Difficult uness
bulk fuel lorries
are retained full.
Special rail tank
wagons essential,
operation of
transfer very slow.
Loads can be easily
transferred,
and
damage limited.
Much less risk.
Quite
simple to
arrange.
Standard vehioles
aro used.
Reserves can be
easily built up
and retained
without monopolising
transport.
Simple.
