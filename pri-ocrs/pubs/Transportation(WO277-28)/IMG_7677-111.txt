Although a firm directive was not received until
April, 1944, planning of the stores, craft and equipment requirements for the
years 1944 5-6 was started, and the forecast was approved and forwarded ho
the War Office in April, 1944.
The forecast of unit requirements was submitted

Advance H.Q., A.L.F.S.E.A. was located at
Barrackpore near Calcutta, while Rear H.Q. remained in Delhi until it closed
down in January, 1945.
Hitherto the Tn. Directorate, 11 Army Group, had
been concerned only with 14th Army and Ceylon Command, but in November,
1944, 14th Army were relieved of responsibility for the L. of C. by the formation
of an L. of C. Command. Most of the Tn. Staff from H.Q. 14th Army were
transferred to this new Command, but during December and January additional
officers were posted to Tn. staff appointments with H.Q. 14th Army, under

A small Tn. staff to control port and I.W.T. operating was
located in Akyab which was occupied during January.

1946, the Burma Railways, Rangoon Port Commissioners, Irrawaddy Floila
Company, Burma Government Marine Department, Penang Harbour Board,
and Malaya Railways took over control of their respective undertakings,

for re-establishing the civilian organization and gradually took over amaration
These units were primarily responsible
of all services from Transportation.
By 1st January, 1946, they had been
transformed into civil organizations and had assumed full control of their
respective services, with minor reservations.
The In. Directorate, by this time very much reduced in size, continued to
be responsible for certain railway construction works, craft erection and port
and I.W.T. operating in Arakan and on the Tenasserim Coast, and continued
to assist the civil authorities with railway, I.W.T. and workshop units. The
rate of reduction in Tn. commitments and the withdrawal of units from January,
1946 onwards were regulated in accordance with the speed at which the civil
authorities could become self-supporting.
Malaya, 1945-1946
Owing to the sudden and unexpected end of the Japanese war in Malaya
and to the fact that no resistance was offered, it was found that Tn. troops would
not be required to assist
in the operation of the railways or ports, and in
consequence most of the units in the order of battle were returned to India.
The officers of these units and certain other ranks were retained, however, to
form the nucleus of a Malayan Railways Supervisory unit, which was formed
to staff civilian pre-war appointments in the European grades. A Railway
Liaison Staff, a Civil Affairs (Malaya) formation consisting mainly of Malayan
Railway officials, was affiliated to the Tn. Directorate and formed the con-
necting link between the Directorate and the Asiatic staff who had been in the
country throughout the Japanese occupation.
The Tn. Directorate, Malaya, was organized into a Directorate of Docks
and I.W.T. and a Directorate of Railways, each under a Deputy Director.
The Railways Directorate had its H.Q. in the F.M.S.R. Head Offices at Kuala
Lumpur. On Ist January, 1946, control of the railway passed from A.L.F.S.E.A.
to the British Civil Administration, and the Railways Directorate became
the Railway Department of that Administration.
Netherlands East Indies, 1945-1946
Following the surrender of the Japanese in August, 1945, transportation
commitments in the Netherlands East Indies grew rapidly. At the beginning
of October the demand for In. units increased from one section of a Port
Operating Company to to full units, and continued to increase until January,
Ample provision had fortunately been made for Malaya, and it was
possible to divert considerable quantities of materials and numbers of morn at
