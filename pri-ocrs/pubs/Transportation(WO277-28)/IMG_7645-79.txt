imported materials.
No values of locally acquired materials were included
in the account in view of the fact that they had already been made a charge
against the Italian Government as described above.
Works of purely military
interest, such as depots, were not included in the Allied Commission account
and were left for adjustment under arrangements made by A.F.H.Q. for the
disposal of fixed assets.
As all statistics necessary for operational purposes were prepared by
Movements, statistics recorded by the Transportation Finance Branch were
limited to ton and passenger kilometres separately for the various types of
traffic, which were obtained from British military freight warrants.
On the
American side documentation was limited to a form of freight waybill, and no
statistics were available until it became evident that figures would really be
Thereupon, an American Fiscal Section was formed as part of the
M..S., to go over the lost ground and to bring the American figures into line
with those prepared on the British side.
Ton and passenger kilometre figures served a triple purpose. In the first
place they could be evaluated on agreed average rates to show the extent of
railway services carried out by the Italian State Railways for the Allied forces;
secondly, they permitted the raising of freight charges against non-military
bodies; and lastly, by including civil figures obtained from the Italian State
Railways in a total of all traffic, it was possible to arrive at the percentage of
civil to total traffic for the purpose of assessing values of coal, petrol and oils
used on the railways for civilian purposes.
It was further possible, by breaking
down the figures into the separate components of the Allied nations, to assess
separately the value of rail services to each country, should this at any time be
required.
