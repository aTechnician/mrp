of 1942, that the shortage of L.S.I. (H.) should be made up by the employment of shallow draught

In November, 1942, the Canadian authorities offered two ships for conversion into L.S.I.s (M.)
and the crews to man them.
This offer was accepted and H.M.C.S. Prince Henry and Prince David
were converted in Canada under Canadian supervision. They were larger ships than the Queen Emma
(gross tonnage 6,983 as against 4,135) and were given an increased armament of two director-
controlled twin 4-in. mountings, two hand-worked single Bofors all on the centre-line, and eight

Their troop capacity was
30 officers and 500 other ranks. By the time the ships came into service, the requirement for carrying
L.C.M. had lapsed to some extent, owing to the difficulty of having L.C.M.s, converted for additional
hoisting, readily available.
Though the ships were converted generally to the British staff
requirements, inexperience in the type of work in Canada led to a number of minor alterations having
to be carried out while the ships were in the European theatre.
After serving with a R.C.N. complement, both in the Mediterranean and Home theatres of war,
they were due to be taken in hand in 1945 for further conversion for service in the Far East, which

Had further time been available, their 4-in. armament
would have been replaced by twin Bofors mountings which would have complied with the current
staff requirements and would have reduced the overloaded condition of the hulls.
Need for closer control during the early stages of an assault, which had been experienced in
Operation " Ironclad" and on many exercises, had firmly established the requirement for a S.N.O.L.

director-controlled twin 4-in. mountings, generous batteries of Oerlikons,

The losses of the large L.S.I. (L.) employed in "Torch" were causing the Minister of War
A paper of 24th May, 1943, drew attention to the position and pointed
out that the present L.S. I.s (L.) in use included nine liners of 15-23,000 tons.
Their use as assault
ships exposed them to exceptional risk and their retention for operational use, usually in the U.K.,

During 1944, every available landing ship was required for operations, and exceptional sacrifices
had to be made to refit landing ships, particularly the L.S.I.s, in time for " Overlord."
Except for
the few employed in the Mediterranean, every L.S.I. took part in this operation after a gruelling
period of training and, in some cases, directly following Mediterranean operations.
When ports were available, the L.S.I.s continued to work as troopers.

The successful L.S.I. (M.) was still wanted for Commando and raiding work but was suspect
for the arduous Far Eastern conditions. Built to light scantlings they were now, by the addition of
armament and considerable constructional weight, overloaded and there was little spare room for
improvements. They had, nevertheless, served magnificently in the Mediterranean and as far afield
as the Arctic Circle, Madagascar, the Equatorial West Coast of Africa and India.
