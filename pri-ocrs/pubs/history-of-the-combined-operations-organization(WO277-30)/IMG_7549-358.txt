The basis of the scheme was agreement between the Colonial
Office and the Service Ministries as to the reserve to be held, which was
accepted at six months, with two months' working margin.
A Committee for the Co-ordination of Supplies was set up in the island.
At the outset, the S.T. items affected were flour, wheat, petrol, kerosine, coal,
coke, and Diesel oil; later, in 1942, a number of other items

the island with articles of local purchase, imports from India, Australia, etc.,
in periodical convoys.
Supply from Middle East
The latter arrangement did not last long, and in the autumn of 1940, it
was decided to supply Malta from Middle East. Malta's demands to the
end of the year were met from the United Kingdom, together with sufficient
additions to make stocks in the island up to 240 days.
This represented
six months' reserve and two months' working margin, the amount being
limited by considerations of turnover and the availability of storage space.
Stocks and reserves included provision for both Regular Army and locally
embodied troops, the latter having previously been fed from civil resources.
From January, 1941, Malta's requirements were included in Middle East's
monthly demands, but shown separately.

Middle East had insufficient cold storage accommodation to hold meat
for delivery to Malta. War Office, therefore, undertook to supply all Malta's
future requirements of certain perishable foodstuffs,
military, e.g., beef, mutton, pork, butter,
margarine, and crated cheese.
Demands for these supplies were made by Malta on Middle East, and repeated
to War Office, with military and civil demands shown separately.

onward shipment from Port Said, and coinciding with shipments of other

For various reasons, the site of the cold store in Malta

In any case, unless air-conditioning had been installed, it would only have
been possible to store tinned supplies in this depot, on account of damp.
Owing to the shortage of material and labour, it was not possible to
build new supply stores above ground, and it became necessary to disperse

known as the Malta Defence Ration Scale, was issued by War Office.

During the lean period, the ration to be issued to the garrison
was, to some extent, increased or decreased in relation to the quantities avail-

authorities to increase the scale of issue of any " co-ordinated" item without
the approval of the Defence Committee.
Slight reductions were effected in the scale at intervals up to April, 1942.
