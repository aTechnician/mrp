Base Supply Depots
In this campaign, B.S.Ds. were employed more often than not at ports,
though in a few cases they were located at Advanced Bases inland.

It was necessary to work 24 hours a day, and there was no respite

average daily turnover of 4,000 tons.
There was considered to be a need

Owing to the shortage of B.S.Ds., the policy was adopted of restrictin

An example of the strain under
which these units
worked in this campaign was seen at Anzio, where for some time the only
tvo D.I.Ds, available received supplies from the sea, held reserves of two
million rations, and made issues to 42,000 troops.
The same factors were
considered to apply to D.I.Ds. as to B.S.Ds., as mentioned above.
Composite Platoons, especially those of Artillery Platoons, were often
detached to operate as D.I.Ds. and run supply points.
One such fed an

for supply by

sent direct to the latter theatre from South America to enable the extra
load to be carried.
Maintenance of the supply proved difficult, owing to the lack of small
refrigerated vessels in the Mediterranean; so the Ministry of War Transport
agreed to maintain the Italian theatre by
direct ocean-going vessels and
to dispense with coastwise traffic from the Middle East.
To make this
possible, it was essential to increase the holdings of the Italian cold storage
depots.
A ship with a capacity of 3,000 tons was used as a depot ship,
and a store of 2,000 tons capacity was constructed at Malta.
