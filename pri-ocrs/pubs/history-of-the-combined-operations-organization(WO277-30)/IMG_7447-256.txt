its worth.
Inspectorate of M.T.
An Inspectorate of M.T.
was formed in Middle East in October, 1940,
under a C.I.M.T.
The main duties of the branch were: â€”
(a) Technical advice to D.S.T.
(b) Guidance of Os.C. M.T. units in the inspection and maintenance
(c) Investigation of defects.
(d) Production of necessary modifications of vehicles and equipment.
The C.I.M.T. was also permanent chairman of the Defects Committe,
a member of the M.T. Advisory Board, Middle East, and member of the
G.H.Q. Fuel and Lubricants Technical Sub-Committee.
When the branch was formed, the number of vehicles on R.A.S.C. charge
was about 4,500.
As this number grew, it became necessary to expand the
number of Inspection Sections, each of which consisted of one inspector, two
mechanist staff serjeants, and a technical M.T. clerk.
During the period ol
the most intensive operations, May, 1943, and of the greatest length of the
L. of C., there were ten sections at work, the scale of allotment being one for
3.500 vehicles.
It was the original intention that every vehicle should be inspected once
every
three
months,
but,
owing to shortage of staff, and the enormous
distances, this figure dropped to once every six months for a time; but finally
a frequency of once every four months was obtained.
In January, 1943, the Branch was amalgamated with the Petrol Insper:
torate (q.v.), and the combined organization was named the

loads were of all natures.
The companies were also used on road and
airfield construction, and did valuable work during the building of the
Haifa-Beirut railway.
The companies in Palestine and Syria were controlled from the technical
point of view by a group headquarters.
The Campaign in Eritrea and the Sudan
Soon after the entry of Italy into the war in June, 1940, the Italians
captured the frontier posts of Kassala and Gallabat, in the Sudan, and thus
threatened Khartum and Port Sudan,
and consequently our Red Sea com-
munications.
They did not exploit this advantage, however, and withdrew
from Kassala in the middle of January, 1941, pursued by 4 and 5 Indian
Divisions, each less a brigade, until they took up a very strong defensive
position at Keren, 150 miles east of Kassala, our railhead.
A major operation was necessary to dislodge the enemy, but the admini-
strative difficulties were considerable.
There was insufficient road trans-
port both for maintenance and build-up of battle reserves, but this deficiency
was overcome, and the main attack began on 15th March, 1941, the position
being taken 12 days later.
4 Indian Division was then withdrawn to fight in the Western Desert,
and 5 Indian Division took up the pursuit, capturing Massawa, the port
and principal town of Eritrea, on 8th April.

The opera-

Section 2 (East Africa).
Amba Alagi was 235 miles south of Massawa, and 5 Indian Division
attacked it on 4th May.
The town surrendered on 15th May, and the Italian
forces in East Africa capitulated next day.
The operations in the Gallabat sector were of a minor character only.
S.T. Organization in Sudan, 1939-1940
Until September.
1940, the senior R.A.S.C. officer in the Sudan was
the O.C., R.A.S.C., Khartum, a major.
There were six R.A.S.C.
vehicles
in that place, and a service company of the Sudan Defence Force had about
30 load-carriers.
The supply depot in Khartum held 120 days' reserves and
30 days' working mare su for 2,300, the normal British garrison.
The normal
supply routes were by sta from Port Said to Port Sudan, and thence by
rail or by the Nile Valley route.
Rations were not normally issued to the Sudan Defence Force in peace-
time, except on patrol,
when supplies were bought locally under unit
