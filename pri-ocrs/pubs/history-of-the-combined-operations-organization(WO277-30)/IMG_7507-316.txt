Special Supply Arrangements
A number of despatches were made, in the early sonths, of items which
had not been included in
the agreed maintenance scheme or which were
urgently required.
Some of these are mentioned here to show the contin-
gencies which had to be met, and to afford further examples of the varied
nature of the commodities handled by the supply service.
They were sent by
express and ordinary coaster and by air.
An urgent request came on D-day for boiled sweets and chewing gum to
combat sea-sickness on air/sea rescue launches.
On D+1, the feeding arrangements for the crews of sections of the
"Mulberry" port were found to be unsatisfactory, and were set right by the
provision of Compo, self-heating soup, cocoa, and rum.
The Commander-in-Chief, 21 Army Group, asked on D-day for cigarettes
to be flown over for him to distribute to the troops.

In all, about
six tons was sent in this way.
After D +30, bread became available from
bakery units in the theatre.
180 tons of bread-making ingredients were flown
over between 27th June and 2nd July to enable an earlier start to be made on
bread issues than originally planned.
Beer, a gift from a brewery firm, began to be shipped on D +42, the first
of nearly 3,000 pints, in 41-gallon casks.
Foot-powder, anti-mosquito creams, matches, sodium arsenite, self-heat-
ing soups, pigeon food, Paris green, lemon crystals, dried egg powder, and
D.D.T., were among other commodities despatched.
Adjustments in Scales
In order to conserve stocks of Compo, the sea passage ration for vessels
sailing from S conserve sto South-Eastern Commands was almost at once
reduced to one day; and self-heating soup was deleted from this scale after
the first three weeks.
an November, 1944, a ration was evolved for the sea

One shipment might mean draw-

concurrently.

small, alternatives were very numerous, and, when broken down into detail.
the provision of each shipment required very detailed schedules and close
liaison with supply agencies and movements branch.
P.O.L. Build-up
By D+1, there were two Petrol Depots, Type "C", in each of the beach
sub-areas, and, even though imports of petrol had to be reduced in favour of
ammunition, and 100,000 gallons of liquid fuel were lost by enemy action
on D+2, a reserve of P.O.L., was built up, because consumption in the
bridgehead was only one-third of the planned figure. By D+6, there were
about 2Â½ days' fuel for every vehicle ashore.
Meantime, arrangements for the introduction of bulk supply had already
begun, with the construction of " tombolas" at Port-en-Bessin.
The first of
these was working by 24th June, and the first load of bulk petrol was dis-
charged from ship to storage ashore six days later. By 5th July, although
bulk petrol was then flowing steadily into the theatre, packed products were
also ariving in large quantities, so that there were now one Type " A " Petrol
Depot, nine Type "B" and nineteen Type "C", working within the beach
The first Mobile Petrol Filling Centre arrived on 30th June, and the
first Bulk Petrol Transport Company on 5th July.
Storage tanks were erected
in the R.M.A., and connected by pipeline with Port-en-Bessin.
By Sth August, the stock of M.T. spirit was sufficient for 33 days'
requirements.
