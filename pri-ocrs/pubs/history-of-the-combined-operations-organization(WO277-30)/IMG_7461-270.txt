The task of making good the deficiency was complicated by there factors-
(a) New formations arrived frich the United Kingdom withou tit
full scale of transport,
which was, in any case, lower than the
found by experience to be essential for desert warfare.
(b) Unbalanced intake of vehicles; for example there was for a to:
a great shortage of 15-cwt. trucks and "bantams" (an early name d
jeep), and 3-ton lorries had to be issued instead.
(c) A great proportion of new vehicle intake at this time consisted
of 30-cwt. non-desert-worthy vehicles, and it was necessary to equip
a number of general transport companies with these, and to employ
the units in the main base area, instead of companies equipped with
desert-worthy vehicles, the latter being released for work with
the Army.
By Ist October, formations had been brought almost up to scale, and
en a number of vehicles not in first class condition were replaced.

In outline, the following were the preparations made: â€”
(a) Eighth Army operational dumps.
Supplies:
Seven days for 10 Corps
Five days for 13 and 30 Corps.
P.O.L.
500,000 gallons for 10 Corps.
(b) Railhead stocks.
Three days' average issues of supplies, ammunition, and P.O.L.
Air Supply
Considerable attention was given to this method of supply, which might
be the only method of maintaining detachments temporarily isolated.
Ample equipment
was provided
and a stock of the
more common
natures of ammunition, supplies and P.O.L. was held ready packed.
the event no call was made on air supply.
P.O.L.
Petrol consumption was now an ever-growing factor in operational plans,
and P.O.L. accounted for over 60 per cent. of the total maintenance ton-
nage for the forces engaged.
The extent of the increase
may be gauged
from the tact unal
calculations for reserves were now
based on a con-
sumption figure of five gallons a vehicle a day, instead of four as formerly,
and on 20 divisions,
at 5,500 vehicles each, for 75 days; a total of over
40 million gallons of M.T. petrol alone.
Petrol supply
was ample, however, and the main difficulty
was the
provision of sufficient containers to meet the heavy demands of the Army
for dumping programmes,
for the establishment of reserves at railhead,
and, as the date of the offensive approached, for the loading of ships in
reddiness for supply by sea.
The factories were worked to the maximum,
and deficiencies were made up by despatches from Palestine.
It was appreciated that demands for P.O.L. would be governed by the
progress of
operations, and were bound to fluctuate.
The day-to-day re-
quirements of the Army were therefore sent to G.H.Q. by mid-day before
the evening of despatch.
A pool of rail wagons was kept ready loaded
with P.O.L.
The P.O.L. in the ships
was loaded on a set pack, and any
balancing was effected by road and rail.
