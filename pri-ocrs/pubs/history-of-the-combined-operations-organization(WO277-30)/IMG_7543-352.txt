Developments, 1942-1943
After the end of the operations in Ethiopia, there was a gradual process
of withdrawal during 1942 and the first half of 1943, including the evacua-
tion of Italian civilians to East Africa and to Italy.
The outstanding event
during this period was the mounting of the expedition to Madagascar in the
Hostilities there ceased in November, 1942, and there-
after the East African Command became more static, and the lines of com-
munication were gradually shortened.
By June, 1943, Ethiopia was largely evacuated, and Central and South
Madagascar had been evacuated by July that year.
The 11 East African
Division sailed for South-East Asia Command about the same time.
As from August, 1943, the command consisted of Kenya,
Uganda, and British and Italian Somaliland.
It was divided into a Northern
and a Southern Area, with an A.D.S.T. for each, and Os.C., R.A.S.C., in

formation, a transport column was sent to Ceylon, which proved so useful
that it was retained till 1945, when it left for Burma.
The transport situation at August, 1943, was that there were six Infantry
Brigade Companies, and 17 G.T. companies,
totalling 91 platoons.
G.T. companies were largely employed on the long road lines of communi-
cation, from Nairobi to Diredawa, 1,700 miles, and from Nairobi to Northern

S.T. was also responsible for the maintenance of 780 affiliated lorry
The full assumption of responsibility in this respect was held up
by delay in the implementation of the formation of three workshop platoons
authorized for the purpose, owing to lack of technical vehicles and personnel,
in both of which E.A.A.S.C. had had to meet heavy calls for transfer to
E.A.E.M.E., when the latter formed.
The formation of the E.A.E.M.E. occasioned some discussion as to the
system of maintenance to be adopted in the command.
Local staff opinion
considered that all vehicle repairs should
be undertaken
(E.A.E.M.E.), in view of local conditions,
was upheld by the
local representatives of Ordnance and E.M.E.
The D.D.S.T., however, con-
sidered that second line repairs should remain an E.A.A.S.C. responsibility.
The question was referred to War Office, who recommended that the War
Office policy of gradual implementation of the new organization (see Chap-
ter III) should be followed.
The matter was settled on the basis of local
arrangements between the two corps for vehicles

They were in a deplorable condition, due to lack of regular maintenance; the
majority had ancient engines, and had been attacked by worm.
It was soon clear that additional vessels were needed to meet commit-
ments, which included the carriage of personnel and stores to and from the
islands, security duties, target-towing, and port duties.
The dispersion of
units in the command, and their location, often made water transport the
only practicable means of communication.
The coast line extended from
Berbera in the north to Tanga in the South.
The distance involved in
visiting the Islands was 7,000 miles by air.
A Water Transport Company was clearly necessary, and it was formed
to operate a vessel strength of 57.
