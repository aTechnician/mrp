The convoy system of running proved superior to that of free running.
The Americans adopted it after
experience
of the latter method.
normal convoy was a platoon, and the average number of vehicles in a
convoy was 29.
Statistics of the " Aid to Russia" lift are shown in Appendix VIG.
Besides the regular through traffic, the column was called upon to run
convoys to various destinations, with indirect aid, such as bitumen for roads,
food for civilian labour on the roads, aviation petrol, etc.
There was a separate arrangement in which three R.A.S.C., G.T. com-
panies took part, for the conveyance of petroleum products.
It was intended
that returning convoys should backload Russian M.T. spirit for use on the
route, but the Soviet could not supply this, owing to the demands of the
Buropean theatre, and their lubricating oils did not come up to the re-
quired specification.
This is dealt with in the P.O.L. section of this part
of this chapter.
In addition, locomotive fuel oil, timber, and bitumen, were
supposed to be back-loaded at the rate of 17,000 tons a month.
Other Transport Services
Besides "Aid to Russia" there were other large scale transport opera-
tions carried out by P.A.I.C.
A L. of C. Transport Column, consisting of four Indian G.P.T. com-
panies, was formed at short notice to organize a route from Kermanshah to
a railhead on the Ahwaz-Teheran railway, for the purpose of conveying
grain for the starving population of Teheran.
There was a shortage due
to the great Russian need of wheat, which was in turn due to the German
occupation of much of Russia's granary and to
scorched earth
policy.
In consequence, they took possession of all wheat in the part of
Persia they were occupying.
The demand was for 10,000 tons of grain
to be delivered by 10th January, 1944, and the first convoy set out on 15th
November, 1943.
Two companies ran 200 miles each way, and the other
two 150.
A further lift of 7,000 tons was asked for, and this was com-
pleted by two companies by mid-February.
In all, over two million miles
were run, with only 12 accidents.
Another important road transport activity was the cross-desert route,
from Baghdad to Palestine.
This was the only road connecting Iraq with
the Middle East, and it therefore, carried a very heavy traffic of troops

the necessity for troop moves, Palestine and Syria were the nearest centres
to P.A.I.., with a suitable climate for British troops to enjoy leave in,
and thus Beirut became the centre for a P.A.I.C. summer leave camp.
One G.P.T. company was employed on troop-carrying from January, 1944,
to Haifa, a distance of 644 miles.
