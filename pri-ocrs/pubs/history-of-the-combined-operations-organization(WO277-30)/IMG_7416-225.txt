B.E.F. also asked for the three ambulance
car companies, due in the
second, fourth, and sixth contingents respectively, to be sent in December,
with two more; and for 250 charabancs for troop-carrying in non-operationd
conditions, but this could not be met owing to shortage of driver personnel.
Yet another demand was owing to the desire of the C.-in-C., B.E.F, to
combine three independent brigades into a division; but the difficulty was
that they had not their full R.A.S.C. organization.

no more R.A.S.C. available from home resources, without upsetting other
arrangements then in hand, and consequently if the R.A.S.C. for the proposi

Vehicle Maintenance and Repair Organization
The base M.T. depot installations, as described in Chapter III, went into
operation as planned, but under considerable handicaps.
Some of the diffi-
culties are described in Appendix VIB, but the installations also suffered from
being badly located in relation to one another.
The closely-knit organization
of the Base M.T. Depot obviously required for its maximum efficiency that
its three components should be located close to each other.
In France, how-
ever, they were not generally speaking favourably sited.
The H.R.S. was
fifteen miles from the M.T.S.D., its constant feeder.
The M.T.S.D. was some
miles from the docks, and the advanced M.T.S.D. was, until December,
actually behind the main depot; it then moved forward to Rouen.
The
V.R.D. was in three widely dispersed parks.
The growing strength of R.A.S.C. vehicles in the B.E.F., which reached
a peak figure of 20,000 excluding motor-cycles, together with the heavy wear
and tear, necessitated arrangements for lightening the load on the Base M.T.
installations.
An additional group of the three components was mobilized,
but it was not ready to go to France before the evacuation.
In the mean-
time, the strain on the H.R.S. was relieved by arrangements by which vehicles
were evacuated to the United Kingdom for overhaul by the makers, under a
Ministry of Supply scheme.
The standard system in regard to reinforcements was that R.A.S.C. per-
sonnel went, with those of other arms, to the General Base Depot; but it was
the policy of the D.S.T. that, if possible,
R.A.S.C. drivers should actually be
passed to the V.R.D., where they could be usefully employed (as the estab-
lishment of drivers for dealing with reserve vehicles was inadequate) and get
practice in driving; and that R.A.S.C. artificers should be sent to the H.R.S.
to keep their hands in until they were required for posting to units.
No provision was made in the original establishment of the S.T. Directorate
of the B.E.F. for an M.T. Inspectorate.
Experience in the war of 1914-1918
had shown this to be necessary, and action was initiated in October, 1939,
for the formation of such an establishment.
This eventually took effect in
February,
1940,
