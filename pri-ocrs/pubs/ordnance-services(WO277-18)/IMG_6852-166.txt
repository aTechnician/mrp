when Imphal and Kohima were cut off.
Sth and Tth Divisions' "boxes" held off all enemy attacks and eventually
the Japanese were isolated, thus allowing normal ammunition supply to be
resumed from 60 and 62 O.F.Ds.
Issues forward of the O.F Ds. were difficult, as 3-ton and 15-cwt. lorries,
and jeeps, sampans and even porters had to be used to get the ammunition
to the troops. Ã€ very large percentage of wooden packages, especially those
made in India, did not stand up to the handling.
This was a source of
worry throughout the whole of the campaign, much of the inspecting ordnance
officers' and ammunition examiners' time being taken in the repair of con-
tainers to the detriment of their proper task of inspecting and repairing live

The next few months was an anxious time. In spite of supplies received
air (which were extremely limited), stocks of ammunition decreased
dally.
When Imphal was finally relieved, holdings of all the important
types were extremely low, especially grenades which were in short supply
in India and in large demand in forward areas.
The road was now cut at Kohima and a report being received that
a Japanese column was marching on Manipur Road, the brigade at Kohima

Fortunately, however, the threat to
The 2nd Division (33 Corps) and a certain amount of armour now
began to arrive at Manipur Road mostly without stocks of first-line ammuni-
tion owing to the rapidity of the move.
This was a serious embarrassment
for a time, as Manipur Road stocks had been depleted by issue forward to
Imphal.
There were no stocks of 3.7 howitzer ammunition or No. 36
grenades.
In order to get important types of ammunition forward as quickly as
possible, a " trap "

personnel from 445 A.A.D.

put at each trans-shipment point on the Brahmaputra to locate, report
progress, and hasten movement of all types of ammunition in short supply.
Before the Japanese attack on the Assam front, expenditure of ammuni-
tion had been extremely light, and little was in transit to forward areas.
Consequently, as reports of continual troop movements in the upper Chindwin
area had been received it had been decided, 31 weeks before the line
was cut, to send forward approximately 6,000 tons as an insurance against
depots being cut off or overrun.
The first consignments of the 6,000 tons
began to arrive at Manipur Road at the same time as 33 Corps Troops, and
enabled the attack on Kohima and subsequent advance to Imphal to be
maintained.
The 2nd Division with its armour eventually moved up to relieve Kohima
and the necessary dumps were formed behind them.
In spite of the splitting
of depot staffs and the continued movement of stocks the supply of ammuni-
tion was maintained.
Until relieved, Kohima garrison were supplied by
air, but owing to
the restricted dropping zones (usually the top of a hill) and the close
proximity of the enemy, a good deal of the ammunition was dropped into the
Japanese lines, or otherwise could not be recovered.
The enemy used
most of this captured ammunition against us, and subsequent reports confirm
the effectiveness of our 3" mortar bombs.
