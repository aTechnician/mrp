and by placing on Port Detachments all executive functions, including those
which had been the responsibility of the Supply Depot and P.O.L. Sections
The requirements of the six port areas were thus covered.
Bread Production-Early Situation
Before the war, about half of the bread required by
R.A.F., in the United Kingdom, was obtained by local contract under R.A.S.C.
maintained for continuation training of R.A.S.C. bakers.
The balance came from five R.A.S.C. static bakeries, mainly
of producing about 160,000 lb. of bread daily, and actually baked about
Very little progress was made in expanding military bread production in
the U.K. during the early months of the war, as the main effort was directed
to the mobilization and despatch to France of field bakeries for the B.E.F
Co-ordination with Civilian Production
At the end of July, 1940, efforts were being made to co-ordinate the
bread requirements of the Services with those of the civilian
population,
mainly by contact between local S.T. representatives and the
√Årea Bread
Officers, and much was done in this way to ensure supply of this essential
commodity.
It was not until early in 1941 that the subject was dealt with comprehen-
sively.
It was then specifically laid down that R.A.S.C. supply officers must
maintain liaison with Ministry of Food Area Bread Officers, and keep them
informed of details (other than price) of Army bread contracts, and of the
locations and capacity of military bakeries.
emergency, but not
otherwise, the A.B.O. might be asked to arrange alternative supply to make
good the failure of a contractor or military bakery due to enemy action or
breakdown.
Area Bread Officers had plans formulated under which, if any civilian
bakery became inoperative through enemy action,
other
bakeries in the
same town or in the district took over its load.
Throughout
the ensuing years, close liaison was maintained in order
that no dislocation of bread supply should arise, and only as the threat of
invasion receded was relaxation of the arrangement permitted.
Employment of Field Bakeries
Meantime, in pursuance of the policy followed throughout the war of
using field force units in the UK whenever possible to supplement supply
by civilian contract, use was made of the sir Field Bakeries mobilized for
all their equipment.
Four of these had gone over to France, and had returned less
quickly as possible.

The position regarding bread supply was reviewed in December, 1941.
The effects were still felt of the peace-time policy of relying on civil contracts.
thus reducing the number of R.A.S.C. personnel to be covered by Army
The capacity of military bakeries in the United Kingdom had not kept up
with the increase in ration strength.
It was, on the other hand, becoming
unsafe to rely too much on civilian production, as contractors were losing their
skilled personnel to the forces and finding it increasingly difficult to meet their
commitments for the Army.
Already, soldier bakers were being lent to con-
tractors to enable them to carry out their obligations; and it was feared that
the trade might often be unable to tender for contracts in future.
The total
estimated requirement, based on a strength of 2,768,000, at 10 oz. a day, was
1,730,000 lb. daily, of which only 600,000 was covered by the capacity of
existing W.D. bakeries.
It was not considered advisable to rely upon civilian
sources for more than half the difference (i.e., 565,000 lb.).
A scheme was
therefore proposed for military bakeries which would increase military pro-
duction by 566,000 lb. daily.
Its terms were as follows: -
Unit
5 Static Bakeries, then existing, to remain
2 Hand Bakeries, then existing,
lo remain
4 Static (A.T.S.) Bakeries, to be formed
13 Field Bakeries. Type " A " producing 390,000 lb.

Daily Production
269,000 lb.
37,500 lb.
200,000 1b.
504,000 lb.
294,000 lb.
Giving a total projected production of
1,304,500 lb.
These proposals required 400 additional personnel, and though they met
with general approval they were not accepted as a whole.
The basis of
calculation-
-the
bread requirements-was reduced to 1,433,000 lb.
for a
strength of 2,293,000.
In fact the ration
strength rose to 2,300,000 in
October, 1941, and averaged about 2,400,000 until August, 1942, when it
passed 21 million.
It was assumed that about 30 per cent. of the total
requirement would always be available from civilian bakeries.
Eventually the reorganization
was effected, and the following lay-out
of W.D. bakeries in the United Kingdom resulted: -
