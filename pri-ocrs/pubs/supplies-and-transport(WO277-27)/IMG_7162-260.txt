This ration was intended to provide palatable and sufficient rations for air-
borne and seaborne troops as a " landing ration" for the first 48 hours until the
supply services were organized.
Provision was made for varied meals of a type
to which the soldier was accustomed, and for five pints of tea.
The calories
available were lower than a normal full ration, but the balance between the
protein, carbohydrate, and fat, was normal.
The pack was arranged so that the items were in hermetically sealed con-
tainers and, provided these were not opened, the soldier could swim a river
and the rations be totally submerged without being spoilt.
They were also safe against vapour or liquid gas attack. About 250,000 of
these packs were produced.
This ration was used as an assault ration for the North African landings;
but while it served its purpose, it was considered to be too heavy and too bulky
in proportion to its nutritive value.
Experiments were accordingly
made with
a view to production of a compact, lightweight ration to meet this particular
need.
As a result, the 24-hour ration was devised.
42. 24-Hour Ration Pack
This pack was intended to be used primarily as a Landing Ration, or as an
Assault Ration and, if special circumstances dictated, as the Sea Passage Ration

The food items were packed in a
waxed cardboard container which was both water and gas proof.
Although
normally designed for subsistence during the first 48 hours of an operation, it
was proved that, owing to its high calorific value (4,000 calories), it would, if
the occasion demanded. produce suffcient eneroy to subsist a man under
strenuous conditions for a period up to ten days, i.e., consuming ten such packs

Troops other than assault troops carried one pack in the larger half of the mess
tin, and one elsewhere.
For assault troups a special pack, called the 24-hour
Ration (A), was provided, which fitted into the smaller half of the mess tin.
It was particularly stressed in the instructions regarding the use of the 24-hour
ration that, when it was used as a landing or assault ration, it was important to
remember that it was for consumption during the first period after disembarka-
tion, when no other supplies would be available.
Troops must not, therefore,
get inquisitive and sample the ration before they disembarked, otherwise they
would go hungry after landing, when they really needed good feeding.
Officers
were directed to make it their duty to inspect the rations to make sure that they
were intact, and to impress on their men that the rations would be the only food
for the first period after landing, and that, if they were lost or eaten, no more
could be provided during this period.
