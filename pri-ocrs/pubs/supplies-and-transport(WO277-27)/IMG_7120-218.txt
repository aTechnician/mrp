The aggregate mileage for the column during its existence was 100,000,000
miles, and the aggregate tonnage 4,000,000 tons.
Between November, 1944, and April, 1945, the quantity of stores sent
forward, excluding P.O.L., varied between 31,000 and 45,000 tons a month,
while petrol, etc., came to between 16,000 and 27,000 tons a month.
The
personnel lift forward varied from 25,000 to 50,000 men a month.
The
Column had a daily average of 8,830 tons on wheels in March, and 9,932 tons
in April.
The lift worked out at 2•75 3-ton vehicles a ton delivered from
Manipur Road to Indainggyi, and four 3-ton vehicles a ton from Manipur
Road to Shwebo.
The allotment of M.T. companies to the L. of C. transport column in
January, 1945, was as follows: -
23 3-ton G.T. Companies; nine 5-ton G.T. Companies; three 10-ton
G.T. Companies; two Bulk Petrol Transport Companies; and one Tank
Transporter Company.
2. The following
were the bases of calculation used in planning in
connection with this organization:
(a) Conversion factors.

(ii) 3-ton lorry lift taken at 2•75 tons.

(b) Method of arriving at the number of effective working vehicles: —
(i Total number of load-carriers (by categories)
on charge
(i Add number of replacement vehicles due in
during the week
(iii) Deduct number of vehicles off the road,
awaiting spares, during the week ...
(iv) Deduct wastage during the week
(v) Take 663 per cent. of the remainder
(vi) Convert to 3-ton equivalent ...
Example:
(i) 5-ton load carriers on charge
(ii) Add vehicles due in during the week
Total
(iii)
Vehicles off road, awaiting spares
(iv) Wastage
(v) Remainder
663 per cent. of remainder
= number of effective 5-ton load carriers.
(vi) Number of effective 3-ton equivalents
= 613 × 1-6
(vii) Effective lift of 5-ton strength = 981 × 2•75 ...
