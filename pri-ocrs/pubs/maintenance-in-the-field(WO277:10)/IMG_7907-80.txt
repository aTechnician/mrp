L. of C. might be switched from Mogadishu.
The short-comings of Berbera
as a port have already been dealt with in the previous section but, poor
though it was, it could be no worse than Mogadishu or Kismayu.
During the time it had been in Italian hands its facilities had not been
improved, though flies, dirt and disease had received the fullest encouragement
from the Italian way of living.
However limited might be the resources of
Berbera,
the road to Gigiga was at least in tolerably good condition, and
the resultant shortening of the L. of C., though suffering from the inevitable
complications of a switch, proved a godsend.
Contact between East Africa
Force and the force occupying Berbera was achieved by skilful timing on
20th March when Nigerian troops occupied Tug Wajale on the borders of

With the capture of Berbera the force was now maintained from two

still necessary to keep open the port of Kismayu for the maintenance of
troops and part of 12 (A) Division; and finally, the
continued lack
of facilities for unloading vehicles at the ports forced the
continuance of the road L. of C. from Kenya, now 1,600 miles long.
12 (A) Division, after the capture of Dolo, had occupied Neghelli on

tunate because, in order to assist 11 (A) Division by delaying the with-
drawal of the enemy along the route Neghelli-Addis Ababa, 12 (A) Division
had been ordered to make a show of force in the area.
So slow, however,
were communications that this message was not received until the division,
which had never intended to stay, had withdrawn from Neghilli.
trative arrangements were therefore put in hand to maintain a small force
after the town had been re-occupied.
After disposing of two more enemy prepared positions on the road to
Harar, 11 (A) Division were confronted by an Italian civil official with the
now familiar white flag, and the town was occupied on 25th March after the
leading troops had covered over 1,000 miles in 30 days an average of
The advance was resumed on 27th March.
The enemy had effected
extensive demolitions, particularly in a mountain pass leading down to Dire-
dawa, but much hard work saw the road re-established in some 36 hours
and Diredawa entered on 29th March.

although at Italian request some troops and armoured cars had entered the

town the night before to stop looting.
A great deal of miscellaneous war
material was found in the capital, and a considerable amount of railway spare
parts, rolling stock and serviceable engines, which the Italians had removed
from Diredawa before blowing up the Awash railway bridge.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE L. OF C.
With the capture of Addis Ababa, a more orthodox system of adminis-
tration became possible; its development is the subject of the following

from Aden as a start, and it was necessary for H.Q., East Africa Force to

Staff, as is always the case in similar circumstances the number of adminis-
trative troops engaged upon the development of the L. of C., the R.A.F.,
gendarmerie, police and P.W. not only vastly increased the original figure
but constituted a constantly fluctuating total, with a general tendency to
Initially, bare maintenance requirements, with no margin for the build-
ing up of any reserve, were assessed at 2,000 tons a week-in the approxi-
mate proportion of 1,000 tons P.O.L. to 500 tons of supplies and 500 tons
of miscellaneous items. Quite apart from such a tonnage having to be
handled with Berbera's meagre facilities, it had to pass through threes pare

might almost be said that the road link bridging the Awash constituted a
fourth stage; it certainly entailed two extra handlings.
In fact, over the period 18th May- 6th July, when the whole L. of C.
was in operation, the tonnage discharged at Berbera averaged about 450
tons a dayâ€”a truly remarkable effort under the difficult circumstances.
this total, some 200 tons daily were carried forward by road to Diredawa
and 150 tons railed on from that point.
Naturally the tonnage decreased
progressively at each stage, representing, in part, the consumption of units
stationed along the L. of C., and in part, the petrol consumption.

on the first stage.

subsequent stages.
Not only were 11 (A) Division now operating well beyond Addis Ababa
and requiring to be maintained by road from rail-head at the capital, but
12 (A) Division operating in the
Galla Sidamo area had found that the
heavy rains were making the L. of C. to Mogadishu precarious, and it was
decided to switch their maintenance to rail-head at Nanyuki in Kenya.
