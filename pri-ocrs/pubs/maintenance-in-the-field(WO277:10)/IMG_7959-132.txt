during the period 1939-1942 are not available,
but after 1941 the steep
rise in war production and the intensified mobilization programme necessi-
tated a further expansion in the service, and the existing and projected
command depots were again found to be inadequate.
This state of affairs
was aggravated by the fact that several depots in the coastal regions had
had to be hurriedly evacuated.
To meet the deficiency, schools, warehouses and factories, all over the
country were requisitioned for service as satellite depots.
although inevitable, resulted in a large unwieldy organization which could
only be operated with considerable administrative difficulty; difficulty which
was further increased by the continual opening, closing and re-grouping of
the satellites.
For instance, in May, 1941, the C.O.D. Cambridge was given
command of sub-depots at Norwich and Thetford. The Cambridge depot
was itself unsatisfactory, consisting as it did of several scattered buildings,

closed and transferred to Ely.

the depots were too small and widely scattered in the majority of cases.
Consequently overheads were unjustifiably large, and the lack of a satis-
factory central provision organization in the early stages complicated the
issue of stores which were in short supply.
Issues were made, according to local circumstances, direct from depots,
from command dumps, rail-heads and road-heads.
The increased use of
divisional ordnance dumps eased, to some degree, the load on the depots
which were unable to make bulk issues to the A.D.O.S. of the division-

to be carried out with an insufficient number of pull-throughs by uninstructed
men who were in most cases quite unfamiliar with the .300 rifle it would

A number of 75 mm. field equipments were imported from the U.S.A.
or evacuated from France and Norway, and were distributed under War
Office arrangements with considerable difficulty.
Almost all of the ammuni-

parts as dial sights were often sent in separate consignments,
