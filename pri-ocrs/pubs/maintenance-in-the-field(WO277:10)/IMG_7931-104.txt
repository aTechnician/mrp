It seemed, however, that for the moment the enemy threat in the Western
Desert was abating.
After a determined attack on Tobruk on 1st May,
which was repelled with heavy losses of both tanks and men, he was content
to remain on the frontier of Egypt, conscious of the ever-present threat
to his L. of C. which Tobruk constituted.

In the period before these tanks arrived all preparations were
made so that the many
" desert" modifications required could be carried
out without delay after arrival.
The majority of the tanks were, however,
found to be the Mk. II "I" tanks which were far too slow and limited in
range for use in the desert, quite apart from the fact that they still mounted
the 2-pdr. gun which was hopelessly inadequate against the German Mk. IV
with its 75 mm. gun.
The bad news concerning these tank reinforcements was only one further
the steady decline of our fortunes which set in at that time
culminating in our evacuation of Greece, so that by the beginning of May
the situation in the Middle East was one of great anxiety.
Although opera-
tions in Abyssinia were proceeding satisfactorily enough if only they could
be completed before the rainy season set in (see Section 4), it was clear
that the enemy was about to launch operations against Crete (see Section 9).
Trouble was also brewing in Syria and Iraq and it is necessary to digress
slightly from the Desert to deal with these diversions.

A brigade group about to be sent from India as reinforcement to Malaya
was accordingly diverted to Basra and this at first had a fortunate effect.
The arrival of a second Brigade was,
however, followed by an action at

Operations began on 25th August and a junction with Russian forces
was achieved on 29th August-later Teheran was occupied jointly on 17th

As soon as hostilities finished, work proceeded on the con-
struction of fortress areas not only in North Iraq but also in Iran and,
in spite of a very severe winter, good progress was made.
Control of Iran enabled British and Russians to open up a common front,
and opened up communications between Russia (via the 870 mile Trans-
Iranian Railway, etc.) and the Persian Gulf, the only sea route by which
supplies could reach the U.S.S.R. at all seasons.
