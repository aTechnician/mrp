On the other hand, the R.A.S.C. had a useful pamphlet

In the B.A.Ds. and at

to shortage of waterproof covers and dunnage, lack of space, ignoring
of safety distances, and guarding difficulties."
The initial requirements of labour for the first contingent were estimated
To meet this demand, 6 labour groups and 48 labour companies
were formed from reservists and from men enlisting into R.A.S.C. depot
As has been seen, a shortage of labour was experienced from

reservists could only be regarded as providing a temporary solution because
it was expected that they had, in time, to return to their parent regiments ;
and the personnel from the depot companies were in many cases quite
unsuited to the work required of them.
In October, upon the formation of the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps,
the quality of the personnel improved greatly, although the deficiency in
numbers still existed, and in December,

total requirement by the end of 1940 would be 220,000,

Arrangements were put in hand for making the
maximum use of civil and foreign labour, but difficulties were encountered
which prevented any rapid progress.
French civil labour was virtually non-
existent, owing to the mobilization of the French
national defence requirements, and did not exceed 5,000 men a day, while
the employment of other foreign labour was beset with political and economic

Other "Q" Services

The Royal Engineers were also concerned initially with the formation
of the hirings directorate which had been under discussion at the War Office
for some time before the outbreak of the war. As it was expected that the
force would only have to occupy a limited area, it had been decided that
the work of the service could be the responsibility of the works directorate
as allowed by Field Service Regulations.
With this decision in mind, the
first hirings staff arrived in France on 6th September under the Director of
Works, but within a matter of days the original decision was reversed and
a Hirings Directorate, the head of which was also president of the Claims
Commission, was formed under the Q.M.G. of the Field Force.
Directorate was responsible for the hiring and requisition of all lands and
buildings required for the purposes of the B.E.F. and for the settlement
of all payments in respect thereof.
Assistance was also given to the "Q"
staff in the issuing of instructions covering billetting procedure (billetting
is not normally the concern of hirings) and such things as payment of
electric light bills, while the presence of a senior hirings officer on recon-
naissances greatly facilitated the setting up of G.H.Q.
were entered into with the French Government, of which the most important
were those on the hiring of bulk petrol installations and filling points, and
cold storage plants.
The establishment of a suitably qualified claims and hiring staff at a
higher headquarters is of much assistance to the "Q" staff in a theatre
of operations, and it will generally happen that "Q" will invite the directorate
to enter into spheres of activities outside their normal duties.
The net
results are, however, of immense value to both parties and it should be an
inflexible rule that the advice of the hirings staff is called for on all matters
concerning the acquisition or use of land and property.
With regard to the Army Postal Service, early in the campaign the

an adequate and speedy delivery of both inward and outward mails.

Postal units were located one

Striking Force.
Three units were also located on the L. of C. Correspondence
posted in the United Kingdom was circulated by civil post offices to the
home postal depot of the Army Postal Services.
There the mail was sorted
for each headquarters and unit, and despatched via Southampton to the base
post office.
From there mails were sent forward by pack train to supply
rail-heads and distributed to units through the appropriate supply column.
