were still in England when active operations began, and
were eventually diverted to other theatres.
In November, 1939, arrangements were made between the War Office
and the India Office for the provision of four animal transport companies,
with wheeled animal transport, for the purpose of getting ammunition, rations,
etc., over badly shelled ground to forward positions; or for use on roads
which for any reason might have been difficult for M.T. vehicles to negotiate.
In the second week of January " Special Force K6" arrived in the theatre,
composed of the four companies complete with their ancillary units, a total
of nearly 2,000 mules and 500 carts with 1,700 R.I.A.S.C. personnel.

"K6" Force for which six sections of R.A.S.C. vehicles each consisting of
seven lorries were provided by the War Office to serve as second and third

Under frosty conditions they were unable to move about on the
paved French roads and they required a disproportionate amount of M.T.
to fetch their forage from rail-head.
Supplies
Turning to the supply services of the R.A.S.C., the following units were
included in the first contingent: â€”
Two Base Supply Depots.
Two Field Butchery and Cold Storage Depots.
Two Field Bakeries.
One Supply Personnel Company.
The supply personnel company has already been mentioned as the source
of the various detail issue depots set up in the ports and on the L. of C.;
the remaining units were for allotment one each to the northern and southern
bases, where temporary premises were at once opened until permanent depots
could be established.
In the northern base a temporary depot (for about 7,000 tons) was opened
at St. Tregonnec, moving later, as will be seen from Map 2, to an area near
L'Hermitage, where a 20,000 ton depot had been constructed.
Similarly,
in the southern base an old factory at Redon with a capacity of approximately
5,000 tons and served by canal from
Nantes was utilized pending
the
construction of a 20,000 ton depot at St. Gildas.
Upon the opening of the
advanced base, warehouses in the dock area of Le Havre were used as a
depot for about 35.000
tons, pending the completion
of a
permanent depot of the same capacity at Abancourt, scheduled for June
but never opened.
The necessity for forward reserves had been foreseen in the maintenance
project, and supply personnel were earmarked for the siting of a field supply
depot.
This was eventually opened at Doullens and held, originally, a
reserve of seven days for the force of four divisions.

The "Field Service" ration scale taken into use had been approved in
1937 and included a tinned equivalent to the fresh items, a need brought
to light during the closing stages of the First World War.
Troops were
placed on this ration immediately after the four-day voyage rations, and
the scale was favourably commented upon by everyone.

it is of interest to note that one general officer considered that the scale
was too generous and could well be reduced.

In point of fact, as the War
was modified from time to time with little ill-effect,
but this development could mostly be attributed to the general shortage of
foodstuffs, and to changes in the composition of the ration, rather than to
the ration being considered excessive.)
The field butcheries and cold storage depots were located at St. Nazaire
and Le Havre and were later increased by two further units; one opened
at Boulogne and the other was earmarked for Dunkirk where the question
of using existing storage and the building of cold stores was under con-

Certain reserves of frozen meat held on military account

France by 16th October, and a further 700 tons was despatched during the
This total of 2,300 tons represented about 40 days' consumption
for the whole force, and subsequently shipments were made in accordance
with demands submitted by G.H.Q. provided that adequate cold storage
space was available.
A total of over 25,000 tons of frozen meat was
despatched to the B.E.F. during the period September, 1939, to May, 1940.
Three field bakeries were in all despatched to the force; two operated
in existing buildings at Bolbec (Le Havre) and the balance was split up in
sections throughout the L. of C.
The supply reserves initially authorized for the base depots were 15 days
Automatic shipments were scheduled until
the second week in October, by which date it was estimated that a reserve
of some 30 days would have accumulated.
In fact, in the early stages the
supply position was anything but satisfactory owing to ships arriving short-

purchases locally that a crisis was averted. The French Army

Later a central purchasing

Supplies were sent forward from the base depots to rail-heads, where

the normal double echelon system then in force, bulk being usually broken
