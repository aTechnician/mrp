APPENDIX B
DESCRIPTION AND BRIEF SPECIFICATION OF THE TRACLAT
A three-quarter track field artillery tractor powered with two standard
Bedford engines, modelled upon the similar German vehicles types Z-GK W3
and Z-GKW5.
The crew's compartment is at the rear and the centre portion
of the body which is not subdivided is available for storage of ammunition, etc.
Initial movement of the steering wheel brings into action steering by the
front wheels.
Further movement of the steering wheel also steers the tracks on
the " Cletrac
" principle.
An essential of this method is that the load on the
front axle must be light. The vehicle is not designed to carry armour.
