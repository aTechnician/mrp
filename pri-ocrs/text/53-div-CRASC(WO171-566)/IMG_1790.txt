Europe.
The time has come to deal the enemy a terrific blow in Western
The blow will be struck by the combined sea, land, and air forces
of the Allies together constituting one great Allied team, under the
supreme command of General Eisenhower.
On the eve of this great adventure I send my best wishes to
every soldier in the Allied team.
To us is given the honour of striking a blow for freedom which
will live in history; and in the better days that lie ahead men will speak
with pride of our doings.
We have a great and a righteous cause.
Let us pray that " The Lord Mighty in Battle
Will go fortl
with our armies, and that His special providence will aid us in the
struggle.
I want every soldier to know that I have complete confidence in
the successful outcome of the operations that we are now about to begin.
With stout hearts, and with enthusiasm for the contest, let us go
forward to victory.
And. as we enter the battle. let us recall the words of a famous
soldier spoken many years ago:-
" He either fears his fate too much,
Or his deserts
are small,
Who dare not
out it to the touch
o win or lose it all

Good luck to each one of you. And good hunting on the main-
