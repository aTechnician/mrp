Locations
In 1939 the Director of Mobilization's office was situated in the War
Office in Whitehall.
In 1940 both the Director of Organization and the
Director of Recruiting, under whose direction the mobilization branch
successively served, were located at Hobart House.
In 1942 the Director
of Recruiting and Mobilization was located in Curzon Street House ;
and
later as Director of Recruiting and Demobilization in 1943 at Hyde Park
Gate, and in 1944 at Chesham Place (as Director of Demobilization). The
mobilization branch, by virtue of the necessity for its close daily contacts
with S.D. (Staff Duties) branches, remained in the main building in Whitehall
throughout the war.
With the exception of S.D. branches, all branches with which A.G.5
(Mob.) had to maintain close daily contact on mobilization
matters were
located in different War Office buildings, e.g. Personnel Branches at Hobart
House and (during 1941-42) at Cheltenham; Equipment Branches at Curzon
Street House and at Metropole Buildings; Vehicle Branches at Metropole
Buildings and at Q.M.G. House.
