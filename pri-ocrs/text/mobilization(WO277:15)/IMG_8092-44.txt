(e) Relation between Peace (Lower) Establishments and War (Higher) Establish-
ments
A reason given in Mob. I's Report for the shortages in personnel on general
mobilization was that " peace establishments bore little relation to the war
requirements of the current plan."
Whatever the plan to be implemented,
peace establishments of existing units should, generally speaking, carry more
than the actual war requirements, especially in officers, warrant officers, and
non-commissioned officers. Unfortunately, these are the most extravagant
to maintain, but experience in 1939 showed that heavy demands in these
ranks, firstly for field force units and secondly for new headquarters, training
caused a severe drain on serving personnel and
resulted in considerable disorganization in the staffs of commands at a time
when they were exceptionally busy with mobilization duties.
(f) Units to be raised on mobilization
As regards field force units which do not exist in peace-time, it is most
important that strong cadres be earmarked, e.g. from the Supplementary
Reserve of Officers and other supervisory personnel, who must be trained in
peace-time to fill vacancies in War Establishments on mobilization. This is
specially important in the case of technical arms such as the Royal Army
Service Corps, Royal Army Ordnance Corps, and the Royal Electrical and
Mechanical Engineers.
Similarly, the inclusion of Territorial Army units in the first contingent
of a field force can only be justified if their organization and administration
are on the same level of efficiency and in the same state of readiness as
(g) Co-ordination of action between personnel branches and Mobilization branch
in provision of personnel for mobilizing units
It is important that there should be the closest liaison between personnel
branches and the Mobilization branch to enable clear instructions to be
issued to mobilizing units, and all concerned with their mobilization, in
regard to provision of personnel, medical categories, leave arrangements,

there was always a chance that the man would absent himself, go sick, or for

To send 50 per cent. at one time while
This added con-
siderably to the period required for mobilization, with the result that urgent
mobilizations, which often became necessary for operational reasons, suffered
in consequence.
There appear to be two solutions : â€”
(i) Orders of Battle for units required for overseas to be issued well ahead
of schedule and normal leave to be continued up to the last minute.
(il) Men posted in to mobilizing units to be selected as far as possible from
among those who have recently had leave, in order to avoid further grant
of leave before being despatched overseas, except in very special cases.
(i) Importance of provision of best available personnel for mobilizing units
It was found necessary more than once to impress the importance of
posting always the very best available men upon commanding officers
ordered to supply drafts or individuals to mobilizing units.
Shortage of man-power dictated that every available man should be
utilized, yet the percentage of rejections by receiving units was very high, and
it was impracticable within a limited time (and with the shortage of medical
officers) to arrange for immediate medical boards to be held to resolve each
case in which there was a divergence of opinion between two medical officers.
This resulted in much extra work for all concerned and also considerable
delay in the completion of units.
The lesson derived was that medical categories must be elastic, so as to
be capable of application to the particular duties in which the individual
concerned could be employed, e.g. batmen, drivers, cooks and telephone
orderlies should be classified individually and suitably to their respective tasks.
A common complaint by officers commanding formations ordered to
mobilize was that a large number of officers were changed in their appoint-
ments after receipt of orders to mobilize.
The commander of one division
reported that during the period of his division's mobilization (three weeks),
no less than 27 officers had been taken away for staff or extra-regimental
Such wholesale changes cannot help but disorganize staff work in a
formation which is mobilizing.
