The amount of repair work carried out in the workshops continued to
increase.
Engine spares, for which indents had been submitted two years
previously, were still not available, and literally, every part which broke had to
be mended or a replacement fabricated in the workshops.
Workshops were
even fabricating cylinder heads from steel plate.
The Kut workshops were
coming into operation, and this enabled the floating workshops to be released
for service at Amara, as well as relieving the pressure on the Base Workshops
occasioned by the fitting out of vessels for India.
The Karun river operations finally ceased in November and all traffic was
diverted to rail.
This enabled the Conservancy Section to concentrate on the
Tigris, and despite unprecedented low levels which lasted to the end of December
the navigable channel was maintained at a minimum depth of 3 ft. 6 ins.
A low river survey from Baghdad to Qurnah was completed in October, as
well as a survey of the Bahmanshir river (between Abadan Island and the
Persian mainland).
Surveys were also completed of the anchorages and
approach channels to Bushire, Kuweit and Masirah Island as well as the ports
of Um Qasr and Bandar Gulf.
The barge construction project at Kuweit, which had been closed down
by the Americans in June, 1943, was re-opened under I.W.T. control at the
end of the year in order to erect various types of knocked-down craft which
were now arriving in the Persian Gulf area.
The load on the engineering department continued to increase steadily
throughout 1944, as the entire fleet was deteriorating rapidly after nearly three
years' continuous service.
Occasionally small consignments of spares arrived,
but for the most part everything had to be repaired or made on site.
foundry was turning out 1,000 castings a month for replacements for Eureka
engines, and a separate section of carpenters was formed to maintain or dis-
mantle Higgins barges.
The Salvage Section of the Marine Department was instrumental in raising
a number of wrecks.
Two large flats had been converted for salvage work
in 1943 and both were kept fully employed during 1944 and recovered craft
and cargo to the value of several thousand pounds.
The policy of retrenchment, followed throughout 1944, was instrumental
in releasing considerable numbers of personnel, British officers and men being
returned to the United Kingdom and Indian personnel being sent to India,
where they were reformed into units for service in Burma.
The year 1944 saw a steady decline in the I.W.T. lift. A sudden rush of
shipping to the Gulf ports in July resulted in a record tonnage for the month,
but this was almost entirely in tidal waters.
The up-river lift was confined
to civil cargo and petroleum when the Khanaqin "Aid to Russia" route was
closed down in June, and the river tonnage was so insignificant that in August
Messis.
Gray Mackenzie and Co. Ltd. were appointed agents for up-river cargo,
while I.W.T. concentrated on port operation.
By the end of 1944, the I.W.T.
organization had carried nearly four million tons of cargo, of which about
a third was for Russia, and the total ton-mileage was 280 million.
