FOREWORD
This book is one of a series of volumes, compiled by authority of
the Army Council, the object of which is to preserve the experience
gained during the Second World War, 1939-1945, in selected fields of
military staff work and administration.
The author has been given
access to official sources of information, and every endeavour has
been made to ensure the accuracy of the work as a historical record.
Any views expressed and conclusions drawn are those of the author,
and do not necessarily reflect those of the Army Council, which, so
far as they relate to current training, are to be found in the official
manuals, training memoranda, etc., issued from time to time by
the War Office.
For the operational background, the reader is referred to the
Official History of the War.
