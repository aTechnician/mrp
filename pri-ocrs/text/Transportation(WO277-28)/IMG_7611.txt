SECTION 8.â€”FINANCE
When a Transportation Directorate was established in the Middle East
towards the end of 1940, a Finance branch was included to cover the financial
responsibility of the Director General of Transportatione or Docks, Railway
and Inland Water Transport services.
In August, 1941, the duties of the Move-
ments staff and the Transportation service were reorganized and responsibility
for docks and railway operating passed from 1 ransportation to Movements;
financial responsibility, however, remained with the Director of Transportation.
This rather unorthodox arrangement continued until 1944.

Transportation finance officers were appointed at the ports of Alexandria,
Port Said and Suez to control and record expenditure for docks working at
these ports and on the Canal.
They passed bills for payment in accordance
Officers were also posted to Haifa and Beirut
in connection with expenditure and recovery of charges in Palestine and Syria.
The year 1942 was the first complete calendar year during which transporta-
tion finance activities were properly recorded.
A major characteristic of the
year was the heavy increase in the carriage and handling of commercial and
non-military traffic by the Army.
The largest tonnages were nitrates and wheat,
but general merchandise for business houses, cereals for the United Kingdom
Commercial Corporation, and goods for Turkey and for the Malta Shipping
Committee were also largely concerned.
The work involved in the recovery of
the cost of these services entailed improvisation, the production of divers forms
of documentation and considerable accounting.
Numerous agreements and
contracts were negotiated and reviewed during the year, the chief of these being
new cargo handling agreements at Alexandria and Suez and freight and pas-
senger agreements over the Palestine and Syrian Railways.

needs in other theatres, which involved all available stores, a decision on dis-
posals was postponed.
Nevertheless, the fact that the matter was raised and
kept continually under notice proved beneficial when, at the end of hostilities,
Transportation Finance were in a position to give up-to-date and useful advice
concerning the disposal of surplus assets.
As the Middle East was the first theatre of operations in which Transportation
Finance problems had been dealt with on a large scale, the experience gained
proved of great value in other theatres.
A Transportation Finance Handbook
was produced in July, 1944 and was used as a guide in Europe, and a number of
finance officers underwent courses of training in the Middle East before being
posted to other theatres.
