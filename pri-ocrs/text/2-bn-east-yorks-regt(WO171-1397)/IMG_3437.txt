before his R/T set was put out of action, A Coy was partially over - run and
O.C. A Coy was taken PW together with C.S. M.Wakelin and a runner, Befolze
their captors could get them away an S.O.S. task was called down and in the
resulting confusion all made their escape. In the meant_ime Tac Bn H.Q. had moved
up to the CHATEAU and had set up in an enemy mortar pit. This posn must have been
on a D.F. task of the enemys as it was under consistant shellfire for many hours
• However, comn with Bde was est by thesig line party running a line from rear
H.Qo up to tac H.Q. and maintaining it constantly. After A Coy had borne the
first brunt of the counter attack, Coy were the next to receive the follow up
of a Tk. Some cas were inflicted and Lt Fetterly personally accounted for a German
Tk Comd who was unwise enough to call upon his Pl to surrender. C & D Coy were up
on the posn by this time and although still under enemy shellfire the posn was
stabilised, consolidated and held. A Tk guns were brought up from the Bn, the Sp tp
who were held up by an emm suffered some cas but followed the battle up as quickly
