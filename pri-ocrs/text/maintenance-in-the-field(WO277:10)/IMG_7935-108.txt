The problem of bringing all the loose elements under control was much
more difficult, largely owing to the impossibility of giving the military police
any transport for rounding-up.
However, a curfew for troops at 1800 hours
daily was introduced in the Suda-Canea area, and it was promulgated that
all men not in formed units or not under camp control would be treated as
deserters. Moreover the gradual organization of some of the gunners into
artillery units and of others into improvised units armed with rifles only,
helped to clear things up.
Everything possible was done to simplify the
procedure for disposing of serious disciplinary cases.
Every effort was made by the C.-in-C., Middle East, to send stores and
materials from his limited resources to increase the means of defence and
a few infantry and light tanks, a number of captured Italian guns and a
certain amount of transport and other arms and equipment were shipped.
Inevitably, a considerable proportion was sunk on the voyage, for the scale
of the enemy attack on shipping was now rapidly increasing in intensity.
equipment, etc., sunk included about half the Italian guns and more than
half the engineer stores required for constructing defences.
Every effort was also made, as much to ease the maintenance problem
as for any other reason, to get rid as soon as possible of all surplus British
personnel, and all prisoners of war of which there finally remained some
16,000 held on the island. A few had been despatched to Egypt but nothing
like enough, from the maintenance point of view, owing partly to lack of
escorted shipping and partly to it being found possible at a late stage to
equip a fair proportion of the surplus British personnel with captured Italian
guns, or to turn them into improvised rifle units.
When some measure of reorganization had been achieved it was found
that the total strength of British troops to be maintained was, as it remained
approximately 28,600, although the fighting strength was
actually less than that of a division, and equipment and transport for even
the operational portion of the force was woefully lacking. In addition, there
were also the following numbers to be maintained: â€”
Greek Army: 14,000.
Prisoners of war: 16,000.
Local population: 400,000.
It was apparent at the outset that the supplies needed for all these had to
be imported by one authority, and that "Q" at force "H.Q. would have to
co-ordinate all requirements if there was to be any hope of G.H.Q., Middle
East, finding a successful solution of the problem.
The Greek Army units in Crete, being mostly recruit units, had no
organization, no transport, no arms or equipment and no resources of food.
It was therefore arranged that the Greek depots and ancillary services were
to be re-organized under the guidance of a small British staff, but the German
attack opened before the plans agreed upon could be put into operation.
British liaison officers were, of course, to act in respect of the needs of the
Greek civil population as well as the Greek Army.
Unfortunately, as the
harvest was not yet gathered, the food situation of the civil population was
at its worst.
To add to the difficulties, there was no effective civil govern-
ment and therefore no organization for clearance of food landed at Suda, nor
