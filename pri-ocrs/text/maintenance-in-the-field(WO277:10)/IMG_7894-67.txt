and the outbreak of war with Germany found the Somaliland Camel Corps
composed of two camel companies which included two pony troops, and
one (Nyasaland) rifle company.
This tiny force was disposed so that the
towns of Burao and Hargeisa could be covered by mounted units while
the Sheikh Pass and Tug Argan Gap were held by dismounted companies
and machine guns.
In October some valuable reinforcements were received
from Southern Rhodesia, but apart from these, no more were received until
mid-May, 1940.
A request by the British garrison to the War Office for
the enlistment of fifty additional men in the Camel Corps was made in
September, 1939, but not approved till the spring of 1940, while General

In December, 1939, the Chiefs of Staff were informed by Middle East

with our obligations to the French, who had constructed strong defences
at Jibuti; and was detrimental to our prestige.

Wavell to make the plans necessary to implement this policy, in conjunction
with the French.
This mandate was, however, accompanied by the proviso
that no troops were to be moved into the protectorate without prior sanction
from London, " in order that the effect of such a movement on our relations
with Italy can be studied, and the necessary notification can be given to
the Italian Government" (sic).
As a natural corollary of this decision, on 13th January, 1940, the troops
in British Somaliland came under full operational control of G.H.Q., Middle

for defences and roads. It seemed to him that the weak points in the

the French commander was unable to obtain permission from the French
Colonial Office to fortify both these passes, on the grounds that Jirre was

too far away from Jibuti, so that all he could do was to place a detachment
at Jirre without constructing defence, while preparations were made to block
the road through the Dobo defile by demolitions.

Various other difficulties arose
to hinder the move of the second battalion and the battery of artillery, and
although approval in principle had been given on 20th April, they did not
arrive until 12th July.
Finally, there was no sign of the special equipment
and authorization for the further expenditure on roads and defences sought
by the garrison commander from the colonial office many months before.
Fortunately administrative control passed to G.H.Q., Middle East, on lst
June, 1940, and so the necessary urgent steps could be taken.
Up to the end of July operations were confined to raids on our part on
the enemy's frontier posts. As elsewhere these raids were almost uniformly
successful in spite of the numerical superiority of the Italians. On 17th June,
however, news arrived of the French armistice, and assurances were quickly
sought and obtained from the French in Jibuti that they would fight on.
These assurances were reiterated in July and they would no doubt have been
honoured had it not been for the Vichy Government's action in sending out
a replacement commander with orders to cease hostilities.

plans to be prepared for evacuation in such a case; but the garrison was
confident that, with the promised reinforcements in sight the position was
by no means hopeless. However, on 23rd July, the new French commander
arrived in Jibuti and assumed office as Governor of French Somaliland, and
the whole of the Italian Eastern Army thereupon became available for
operations solely against the British Territory.

to five battalions, there was a good chance of holding our positions, and in
view of the fact that withdrawal without fighting would be more detrimental
to our prestige than withdrawal after attack, the decision was taken to rein-
