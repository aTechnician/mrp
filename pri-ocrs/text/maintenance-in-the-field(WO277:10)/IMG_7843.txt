Engineer Works Services and Stores
The next of the Q.M.G's. major charges to be dealt with is the large
organization of engineer works services and stores which evolved from the
pre-war directorate of Fortifications and Works.
This was the sole Q.M.G.
directorate dealing with all matters appertaining to the Royal Engineers,
except that certain duties relating to the provision of engineer stores had
been bequeathed to the Director General of Munitions Production by the
Master-General of the Ordnance on his demise in 1936. Indeed, the reader
may be surprised to learn that the appointment of Engineer-in-Chief dates
only from the period of the Second World War; in a Royal Warrant of
1683 which set forth the duties of the Board of Ordnance, the Chief Engineer
(" a person skilled in all the parts of mathematicks") is named only as a
very minor official, and for the next 250 years the control of the engineering
services of the Army was generally vested in the M.G.O.
After 1927,
however, the Quarter-Master-General assumed all responsibility for engineer
services and building, and from that date on the Directorate of Fortifications
and Works remained an integral part of the Department, growing in
importance from year to year.
Responsibility for the operational side of the Royal Engineers was exer-
cised by C.I.G.S. through a Deputy Director of Staff Duties (R.E.) and a

of the Directorate of Military Training.
During 1939 an effort
was made to achieve some degree of co-ordination by the appointment of
the Controller of Engineer Services (see Diagram 1), but this appointment
was allowed to lapse shortly after the outbreak of war.
With the imme-
expansion of the field engineers this state of affairs was obviously
and unreal, since the operational work of the Royal Engineers
was fast overtaking in significance the more static duties of the D.F.W. For
this reason, in 1941, an officer was appointed with the dual title of Engineer-
in-Chief and Director of the Royal Engineers. He owed allegiance to two
council members.
As Engineer-in-Chief, he answered to the Quarter-Master
General for matters appertaining to works services and engineer stores. As
Director of the Royal Engineers he was adviser to the Chief of the Imperial
General Staff on R.E. policy and operational questions and thus fell into
line in this respect with the other " arms directors."
He exercised his dual functions as follows:
E.-in-C. and D.R.E.*

* As D.R.E. he was adviser to C.I.G.S. on R.E. policy and operational questions, and to
D.C.I.G.S. on R.E. corps questions.
The Director of Fortifications and Works, acting as a deputy to the
E.-in-C., conformed throughout to his pre-war functions, with the important
exception that during 1943 the stores side of the work of the Directorate
was separated into a Directorate of Engineer Stores, which took over certain
duties from the old M.G.O. branches of the D.G.M.P. and certain others
from the D.F.W.
The organization of the Directorates of Fortifications and Works and
Engineer Stores was as follows:
