In order that the
maximum
benefit could be obtained from the re-
organization a campaign was initiated jointly by the War Office and G.H.Q.
to make commanders and staffs at home more mechanically minded and
pay increased attention to maintenance within their formations.
Unit com-
manders were impressed with their
responsibility for vehicle maintenance,
this being reinforced by a threat of disciplinary action which, however, was
rarely put into effect.
The new organization even when modified for Home Forces provided
flexibility and a policy of progressive maintenance.
Its success was of
course dependent upon
of adequate numbers of personnel,
equipment and spare parts,
but its development continued along planned
lines with such effect that it later served as the hard core of the organization
of R.E.M.E. upon the latter's formation.
Military labour requirements in the United Kingdom were divided into
two main classes:
labour employed on construction,
labour employed in static installations and depots and
defence works, and other

pioneer work.
During 1940/41, apart from work in depots, priority administrative
tasks consisted of clearance of bomb damage, construction of defences, and
airfield construction and repair. As the work on defences progressed there
was a gradual switch over to construction of A.A. sites and accommodation

By the beginning of 1941 the number of pioneer companies engaged

The Director of Labour thereupon suggested that as there was apparently
number of men not essentially employed, these could either be
conscripted and enlisted into pioneer companies or be employed as civilians
on debris clearance, thus releasing the companies tied up in London.
Minister of Labour would not agree at first to either of these two courses
but did subsequently consent to debris clearance being
undertaken by civilians, thus enabling the pioneer companies to be with-
This relief was, however, short-lived since within a month, as a
result of intervention by the Prime Minister, 12 companies were loaned to
certain county war agricultural executive committees for farm work.
This
meant of course that, of the 29 companies released from London, only 17
were of benefit to Home Forces.
All labour questions at home were, of course, bound up with general
economic and political considerations, particularly those relating to any aspect
of compulsory recruitment.
This made it of the utmost importance that
the very best use was made of the labour, military and civilian, that was
available to the War Office.
In every case, pioneer companies, provided
that they were properly employed, produced results far beyond what was
expected of them.
HOME MOVEMENT CONTROL
Contrary to popular belief, although the movement of personnel and
stores had long been an important duty of the Quartermaster-General (under
the Director-General of Movements and Railways during the First World
War and the Director of Movements and Quartering during
the period
1919-1939) a comprehensive movement control organization did not exist
in this country until the beginning of the war.
It is therefore proposed to

During the first days of September, 1939, movement control staff officers
were installed in each command and district.
From the outset, these officers

They had a dual role, which although tested and found successful through
the war, led to somewhat understandable confusion in the early days.
