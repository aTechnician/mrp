FOREWORD
This book is one of a series of volumes, compiled by authority of
the Army Council, the object of which is to preserve the experience
gained during the Second World War, 1939-1945, in selected fields
of military staff work and administration.
The author has been
given access to official sources of information, and every endeavour
has been made to ensure the accuracy of the work as a historical
record.
Any views expressed and conclusions drawn are those of
the author, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Army
Council, which, so far as they relate to current training, are to be
found in the official manuals, training memoranda, etc., issued from
time to time by the War Office.
For the operational background, the reader is referred to the
Official History of the War.
