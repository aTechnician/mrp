hospital groups, i.e., 15,000 beds.

The 65 per cent. Plan was not implemented and remained only an examina-
tion.
Through its agency, however, much more realistic target completion
dates were arrived at and certain construction was suitably deferred.
Early in January, 1943, it seemed that an insufficiency of storage space
was becoming a bottleneck preventing the desired increase in the monthly
intake to 120,000 personnel and 120 store ships.
As a relief, the Q.M.G.
directed that construction of covered storage be so planned as to allow
completion of 25 per cent. by 1st May, 1943, 50 per cent. by 1st June, 1943,
75 per cent. by 1st September, 1943, and the balance by 15th October, 1943.
In addition,
four large rail-served depots, each of 450,000 sq. ft. covered
storage, were to be constructed for completion at the earliest possible date.
The Casablanca Conference (" Symbol ") in January, 1943, however, re-
examined the
whole project from every aspect and was in possession of a
much more accurate forecast of shipping capabilities.
It was agreed that
it would be possible to provide a lift for a force of 1,100,000 to be built
up by 31st December, 1943, composed as follows :—
141 Divisions
600.000
Services of Supply …
300.000
Air Forces
With this decision, British and U.S. planning was in line again, and as the
new forecast did not materially differ from that covered by the third key
plan, this was accepted by the Americans and the construction programme
was jointly pressed forward to the uttermost.
There still remained an acute shortage of building labour but all requests
for additional labour to expedite construction were turned
down.
Q.M.G. had, therefore, to accept certain modifications to the
construction programme outlined in the third key plan.

Further Revision
Within six months, however, it was necessary for yet another revision to

The fourth key plan was issued in July, 1943, to deal
with this increased commitment under which the Army was responsible for
the accommodation of 967,000 (including 30,000 U.S. A.A.) personnel These
were to be located as follows: —
Southern Command

45.000
The ground forces were to be located solely in the Southern and Western
Commands with the exception of part of one infantry corps in Northern
Ireland.
Their location was of course, governed by tactical considerations.
On the other hand, many S.O.S. Troops could be located in accordance with
availability of accommodation, and to assist commands in planning, S.O.S.
Troops were divided into three categories.
S.O.S. " Located" Troops
Those troops who had to be accommodated in specific or existing instal-
lations which they were to operate (e.g, stafis of hospitals and depots).
S.O.S. " Allotted" Troops
Certain additional troops requiring accommodation in the vicinity of
ports and installations where they were to work (e.g. labour and trans-
portation units).
S.O.S. " Unlocated" Troops
All other S.O.S. troops who could be located anywhere where accom-
modation was available.
By this time the size of the contingent had increased to such an extent that

commands was quite insufficient.
