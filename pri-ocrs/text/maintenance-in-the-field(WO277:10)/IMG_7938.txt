able difficulties arising out of the
use of a port with no adequate shore
facilities such as cranes, a marked shortage of lighters, no ship-repair facilities
and, above all, a hurriedly assembled and inexperienced staff.
As in Greece, air alarms in the port were abolished and work continued
until an attack took place, each small detachment or working party taking
cover when they thought it essential.
At a later stage, however, the scale
and suddenness of dive-bombing attack became so great that the presence
of enemy aircraft in the neighbourhood resulted in the stoppage of all work.
Resort was made to night work, but in the absence of an elaborate, well-
system this could not be expected to yield much result.

were no auxiliary engines in working order for the winches and
no ancillary lighting system, power had then to be provided by putting a
small ship alongside.
However, the civilian crews generally abandoned
their ships, and soldiers acting as winchmen and stevedores found great
difficulty in organizing their work in the dark without assistance.
There were also many other questions such as the slow turn-round of
transport in the depots as well as in the port, provision of guards and
military police, provision of hot tea and meals for labour, stevedores and
transport drivers, and the organization of air defence, medical arrangements
and fire-fighting
In Suda, as formerly in Piraeus, it was found
necessary to appoint a senior combatant officer for general supervision of
the port area without interfering with the technical working.
It had been hoped that a clearance figure of 30,000 tons a month might
be attained, and this was indeed set as the target, to meet essential current
needs and build up reserves.
At the same time the inherent difficulties were
fully appreciated and it was recognized that some 20,000 might have to
The first plan to have a fortnightly convoy was amended to clearing
two fairly fast ships of 2,500 tons each weekly, with an additional specially
loaded ship cleared at Heraklion fortnightly, chiefly for Greek needs.
To the greatest possible extent supply to sectors was made by sea rather
than by road owing to the shortage of transport, but this alternative gradually
fell away in capacity-Greek crews would not man their ships or caiques,
and lighters broke down and were sunk. Volunteer military crews were
called for, and some were actually employed, but the difficulties were legion.
Tymbaki and Selinos were the only places on the south coast served by

south coast of Crete; the road ended at the top of an escarpment leaving
five miles of mule-tracks to the coast.)
When shipping losses at Suda became acute, anti-aircraft defences were
concentrated in an " umbrella" over the pier and quay.
But the majority
of ships sent from Egypt were either sunk on the way or burnt out in
Bay, and it soon became evident that maintenance through Suda
with the type of ships available was not possible.
As in Greece the only

alternative was a daily delivery of small quantities by fast ships, arriving,
discharging and escaping under cover of darkness, but for this neither the
ships nor their escorts were available, and for the delivery of much-needed
vehicles it was not a feasible proposition at all. As a last resort it was

the withdrawal which passed through the base depot area made it impossible
to form any dumps further south on the Sphakia road either from stocks
existing in the north or delivered at Suda.
