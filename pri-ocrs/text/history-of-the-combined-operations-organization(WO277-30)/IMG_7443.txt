Solid Fuel, 1941
In July, 1941, the procedure for the provision of solid fuel was simplifed
when the Director General of Transportation co-ordinated all military coal
demands in the Middle East.
He notified requirements direct to S.T. 6, ho
then asked M.O.W.T. to allot tonnage, and notified details of this to Middle
East.
The latter then gave India details of the type of fuel required.
From 1941 onwards, Middle East stock states included all military and
railway installations
in the
theatre,
but their demands covered military
requirements only.
Supplies for the civil railways were obtained through
normal commercial channels by the railways.
Stocks were controlled by the
Middle East Supplies Council to the extent that they ordered diversions of
non-military colliers, having regard to the general coal position of bunkers,
railways and military stocks, at the time.
Subject to the agreement of GHO,
Middle East, they could also similarly divert military colliers.
P.O.L. Reserve Storage

for 15 divisions.
Although sites were reconnoitred, none of the new acon:
modation became available until the latter half of 1941; and very litte rodig
for P.O.L. reserves was available before 1943, with the result that fres
wastage occurred.
The scale on which reserves were to be held in eat
command under G.H.Q., Middle East, was as follows: â€”

The scale was 150 days' packed for the number of C.I.-engined
vehicles in, or expected in, the various commands.
(c) Lubricants.
The reserve target was 150 days', calculated at six per cent. of
the petrol and diesel consumption.
It was evident that the or meal scheme for bulk storage of metal it. ear
was now inadequate for the new and greatly increased commitment.
Office therefore provided twenty-six 6,000-gallon tanks, to be used as an
extension of the Gebel Dave storage project.
The plan was known as the

It was planned to complete one tank a week, but
dislocation, due to air raids, of production in the United Kingdom and ship-
ping difficulties, made it impossible to work to any programme.
Five tanks
were lost at sea.
Tankage and pipeline schemes elsewhere were carried out under the
Director of Works, who would also be responsible for maintenance of the
whole project when completed.
Provision of P.O.L. Containers
The necessary bulk storage being thus provided for, the main priority was
the provision of the containers for distributive purposes.
Continued efforts
had been proceeding to find a solution to the container problem in the
direction of the returnable can, but nothing satisfactory had yet been found.
Proposals made through departmental channels for the provision of a plant
capable of producing 100,000 4-gallon drums a month as a safeguard against
the plant at Suez being put out of action were not supported. 70,000 2-gallon
cans were ordered from India, but were not delivered for many months.

Directorate had many of this type made by small contractors; but practically
the whole output of this sort of container was required for equipping vehicles

The local product had to be made from the tin-plate imported for
the manufacture of 4-gallon tins, and the result was a weak and unsatisfactory
package, with a life for water distribution of only two trips.
