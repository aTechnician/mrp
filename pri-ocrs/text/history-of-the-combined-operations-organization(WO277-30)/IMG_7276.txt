Expeditionary
Force responsibilities,
which were laid down at the time, included assisting the Commodore
Combined Operations in the supervision of the training of Expeditionary Force units and formations
at C.T.C.s.
Although the ultimate responsibility for training Expeditionary Force units rested
with the Commander Expeditionary Force, it will be noted that considerable assistance in their
training was given by C.T.C.s.

Combined Operations Pampblet No. 2, Beach Organisation and Maintenance
In the autumn of 1942, a pamphlet on Beach Organisation and Maintenance was issued under
the Direction of the C.C.O.
The term Beach Organisation was defined as including all arrangements
made by beach parties for the movement of personnel and vehicles across the beaches to assembly
areas and dumps respectively; and for their reception at those areas and dumps by the formation
and Services concerned.

It also included the provision and operation of all necessary facilities
The respective naval and army responsibilities were laid down, together with the method of
development of the beach organisation in the order of landing of its various components from first
touch-down to the setting up of a ferry service and a beach maintenance area.
For the first time a standard beach party for one brigade at assault scales, known as a Brigade

The Senior Naval Officer Landing was responsible for the organisation and control of the anchorage

He exercised control over the beaches through the Principal

The disembarkation of R.A.F. personnel and stores was the Army's responsibility.
When necessary, R.A.F. Liaison Officers were appointed to assist in the landing and clearance of
R.A.F. personnel and material.
Development in the Middle East
Owing to the circumstances surrounding the development of the beach organisation, in
particular the availability of personnel and material, the majority of training had been carried out
initially in the U.K., the development of new technique being centralised in C.O.H.Q.
