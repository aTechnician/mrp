it would be worth laying a 4-inch pipeline tina
It was estimated that
on a desert L. of C. 300 miles long, the provision of a 4-inch line with
capacity of 180,000 gallons a day would effect a saving of 9,000 person
4,700 vehicles, 450,000 4-gallon returnable cans (or 50,000/60,000 4 glin
tins a day), and 22,000 gallons of petrol a day for load-carrying veils,
as compared with maintaining the supply of the same quantity of petr
in returnable containers carried in 3-ton vehicles.
As the line never became
stabilized west of Tobruk after June, 1942, the scheme was never de
veloped.
There was also a proposal to lay a 6-inch line westwards from
Alexandria to the
Western Desert, but the rapid advance of the Eigh
Army after the battle of El Alamein made the laying of the line unnecessary.
Bulk Distribution
Bulk distribution was developed, as equipment began to arrive during
the latter part of 1941, along three separate lines:
(a) Main route refuelling points, for the fuelling of convoys on all
the main Middle East routes.
(b) Bulk outfits in unit lines, base camps and installations.
(c) Semi-bulk in returnable containers.
This was provided by:â€”
(i) Filling containers at main route refuelling points, or bul
outfits,
and issuing at outlying consuming points on the bais
of fulls for empties.
(ii) Allocating a number of barrels to a formation or area, unil

In preparation for the offensive at El Alamein in November, 1942, a
number of non-runner Italian road tankers were brought up from Eritrea,
with the object of towing them out along the Western Desert road, and
using them as static tanks into
which Bulk Petrol Transport Companies
could discharge their loads, and from which vehicles could be refuelled and

Solid Fuel, 1942
The closing of the Mediterranean in May, 1940, had necessitated drawing
on all available Middle East resources, and the entry of Greece into the war
in 1941 had increased Middle East requirements (including military, civil,
Admiralty, etc.) to 200,000 tons a month.
It was never possible for sub-
stantial stocks to be built up.
This, and the reduced amount of coal
available from Calcutta (owing to labour shortage and shipping difficulties),
made it necessary to find an alternative source of supply.
By May,
1942, Middle East stocks were down to a dangerously low
level, and 75,000 tons from the United Kingdom, and 25,000 tons from
U.S.A. were shipped in May and June.
For the future, Middle East would
have to rely mainly on South African coal.
Co-ordination of provision was
erefore, taken over by S.T.6, War Office, and Middle East ceased to
deal with India.
P.A.I.C. began to make independent arrangements for its
coal supplies.
By the end of 1942, Libya was included in Middle East
demands, now totalling 16,000 tons a month for military use.
Most of
this came from South Africa, being shipped from Lorenzo Marques and
Durban through civilian agents.
At Durban, an Admiralty
contract already existed which was used
by the Army until July, 1944, when
the War Department made a direct
arrangement.
S.T.6 kept the
Admiralty informed of requirements from
Durban; the Director of Sea
Transport notified Middle
Fast and the
Principal Sea Transport Officer, Egypt, of sailings; and Middle East notified
P.S.T.O., Egypt,
of discharge ports.
All military cargoes were ordered
to Suez, where Middle East gave instructions as to their destination.
