FOREWORD
This book is one of a series of volumes, compiled by authority of the Army
Council, the object of which is to preserve the experience gained during the
Second World War, 1939-1945, in selected fields of military staff work and
administration.
The author has been given access to official sources of
information, and every endeavour has been made to ensure the accuracy of the
work as a historical record. Any views expressed and conclusions drawn are
those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Army Council,
which, so far as they relate to current training, are to be found in the official
manuals, training memoranda, etc., issued from time to time by the War Office.
For the operational background, the reader is referred to the Official History
of the War.
