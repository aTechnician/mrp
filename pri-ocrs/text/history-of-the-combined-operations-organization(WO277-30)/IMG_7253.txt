The severe strain put upon the Landing Craft and Bosto Organisation by this operation may be
assessed by vetering to the paper submitted by the C.C.O. to the Chiefs of Staff on 30th Septembet,
1942, which is quoted in full at Appendix II.
Formation of Force "J"
After the return of the ships and craft which had taken part in Operation " Jubilee" (Dieppe),
they were kept under the command of Captain J. Hughes Hallett, R.N. in the Solent area where
they were ready for any further raids.
The small I.S.I.s and the landing ships (stern chute) had to be employed ferrying landing craft
required for "Torch" from the south to the north coasts.
It was clear to the C.C.O. that this force must remain in being and kept on the alert for any
further operations.
He therefore suggested to the Admiralty that the ships and craft should be
organised as a permanent force and given the title of Force " J."
The idea that this force should
form the prototype for the other assault forces, which were to be used in Operation " Overlord,
was agreed by the Admiralty.
Force " J" came into being on 12th October, 1942, and the Senior Naval Officer set up his
headquarters in the Royal Yacht Squadron at Cowes which was commissioned as H.M.S. Vectis.
as a combined headquarters for the planning and execution of operations " Rutter
The dates in Porce occupied a block of flats on the sea front which was uriginaly naisitioned
The next step taken by the C.C.O. was to send a memorandum to the Chiefs of Staff urging
the formation of similar forces.
The text of the memorandum is quoted in full in Chapter 6.1
It will be seen from this memorandum that Force " J" was of considerable size and it was
fortunate that berthing for the ships and craft could be found in the Solent.
From the point of
view of training, the Solent was excellent, as in sheltered water it provided strong
cross-tides

Mounting of Forces for Operation " Husky"
The middle of February, 1943, found the base at Rosneath once again a going concern in the
hands of the C.C.O.
It had been decided that this establishment was not to be considered as a
Training Base but was to be used for mounting overseas operations.
The facilities provided were
a deep-water jetty, large storage space, facilities for fitting out craft, accommodation for personnel
and excellent workshops.
Another and most important part of this establishment was a small engineering school, fitted
out by the Americans at the instigation of C.C.O., where all engine room and maintenance ratings
could be given courses in the engines that they were likely to find on service, most of which were of
American manufacture.
Every facility that the base at Rosneath possessed was used to the full during 1943.
without it, the mounting of the forces, which were required for overseas operations, could not have
been carried out as quickly and economically as they were.
The plan for " Husky" entailed the mounting of two Assault Forces on the Clyde, Force " W"?
and Force " V". The composition of these two Forces was as follows : —
Force "W"
Force "V"
