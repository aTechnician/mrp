2. With both (a) and (b) above D.X.O.R. was actively concerned. C.O.H.D. was perhaps the first
was D.X.O.R. who obtained much vital information from the U.
before any U.S.
models were received in
production of a British am phibian, but it was some time before action was taken by the Service Ministries.
3. With reference to the work mentioned in para, 1 (a) above, functional trials of the U.S. amphibians
were arranged by D.X.O.R. at C.O.X.E.
The following amphibians were tested and reported on :
(a) Wheeled.-Aqua Cheetah, Amphibious Jeep, D.U.K. W.
(b) Tracked.-L.V.T. (1), (2),
(No U.S. armoured amphibians were received in this
country, but the L.V.T. (A) (4) underwent tests at C.O.X.E. (I.) based on trials held for other
amphibians at C.O.X.E.(U.K.).)
4. With reference to the work mentioned in paragraph 1 (b) D.X.O.R. was concerned as follows :—
(a) When it appeared that there might be a shortage of D.U.K. W.s for " Overlord," a British
wheeled amphibian with a larger pay load than the D.U.K. W. was produced, the Terrapin I.
should be kept short enough to
allow it to be hoisted in an L.S.T.
(2) lift, led to great
difficulties in its design and possibly had much to do with the fact that the vehicle was not
Functional trials were carried out at C.O.X.E. and the modifications made to
this amphibian arose as a result of the C.O.X.E. recommendations.
Also as a
these recommendations, it was decided that only a limited number (500) of Terrapin I should
be produced
for immediate operational needs and that a design of a second mark of
Terrapin should proceed with less rigorous staff requirements.
(6) When the Terrapin II was produced, the functional trials were again directed by D.X.O.R.
and held at C.O.X.E. and the recommendations made in the original C.O.X.E.
report led
to certain important modifications being made in the prototype ;
further trials led to the
decision not to produce this amphibian but to seal the design.
(c) Independently of any staff requirements the Nuffield Corporation produced in 1943 a tracked
amphibian known as the Argosy.
Again functional trials were held at C.O.X.E. and, as a
result of their recommendations, it was decided that the Argosy was unsatisfactory for
operational use.
(d) In 1944 45 the British tracked amphibian " Neptune" was designed and produced.
C.O.H.Q. had a great deal to do with framing the staff requirements and representatives of
io as bra da an intintely cos vete helta coX uction of the amphibian in all.
5. Besides the normal functional trials of amphibians, many trials were held at C.O.X.E. of projects
of modifications to amphibians for use in special circumstances.
These were initiated or handled by
officers of D.X.O.R.'s branch ; some projects were their own ideas, others were given to them by outside
authorities.
Trials such as the following were undertaken :
(a) Mounting and firing of artillery in amphibians.
(b) Mounting of fire escape ladder in D.U.K.W. for cliff climbing.
(c) Mounting of " A" frame in D.U.K.W.
(d) Carriage of Auster aircraft in various amphibians.
6. (a) During the last year of the war, a committee known
Development of L.V.T." was established in the U.S.A.
as the "Continuing Board for the
Representatives of Army, Navy
and Marines were members and the mission of the Board, as stated in its directive, was
amphibious operations."
' to co-ordinate departmental activities toward the development of L.V.T.s for use in
The members of the Board were instructed to meet as necessary
to witness tests and to consider changes and recommendations to permit the development
of L.V.T.s to meet Service requirements.
(b) Since amphibian development in the U.K. was increasing and both Army and Navy were
planning new designs and developments, D.X.O.R. suggested that a similar board should
Representatives of the Service Ministries and C.O.H.Q. overe members and, with D.X.O.R.
as chairman and a member of his directorate as secretary, the necessary
knowledge and
experience of amphibians was constantly kept to the tore, so that future development was
telated closely to existing knowledge and to the many other matters which must be borne
in mind in combined operations.
