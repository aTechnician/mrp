As the line never became

1942, the scheme was never de

There was also a proposal to lay a 6-inch line westwards fro
Alexandria to the Western
Desert, but the rapid advance of the Eighth
Army after the battle of El Alamein made the laying of the line unnecessary.
Bulk Distribution
Bulk distribution was developed, as equipment began to arrive during
the latter part of 1941, along three separate lines: -
(a) Main route refuelling points, for the fuelling of convoys on al
the main Middle East routes.
(b) Bulk outfits in unit lines, base camps and installations.
(c) Semi-bulk in returnable containers.
This was provided by:â€”
(i) Filling containers at main
route refuelling points, or bulk

of fulls for empties.

The refuelling of large convoys at main route refuelling stations vas
speeded up by laying out filled 4-gallon returnable containers in groups
of four or six in

near the bulk refuelling system, so
that any number of vehicles up to 500 could be refuelled simultaneously.
Proposals to establish bulk refuelling points along the Western Desert
L. of C. were first made early in 1941; but they were turned down on the
grounds that the Western Desert battle was over, and the route woul be
very little used.

and facilities for filling returnable containers had been established at tow

Solid Fuel, 1942
The closing of the Mediterranean in May, 1940, had necessitated drawing
on all available Middle East resources, and the entry of Greece into the war
in 1941 had increased Middle East requirements (including military, civil,
Admiralty, etc.) to 200,000 tons a month.
It was never possible for sub-
stantial stocks to be built up.
This, and the reduced amount
of coal
available from Calcutta (owing to labour shortage and shipping difficulties),
made it necessary to find an alternative source of supply.
By May, 1942, Middle East stocks were down to a dangerously low
level, and 75,000 tons from the United Kingdom, and 25,000 tons from
U.S.A. were shipped in May and June.
For the future, Middle East would
have to rely mainly on South African coal. Co-ordination of provision was,
therefore taken over bv
S.T.6, War Office, and Middle East ceased to
deal with India.
P.A.I.C. began to make independent arrangements for its
coal supplies.
By the end of 1942, Libya was included in Middle East
demands, now totalling 16,000 tons a month for military use.
Most of
this acts, now olin Africa, being shipped from Lorenzo Marques and
Durban through civilian agents.
At Durban, an Admiralty contract already existed which was used
by the Army until July, 1944, when the War Department made a direct
arrangement.
S.T.6 kept the Admiralty informed of requirements from
Durban; the Director of Sea
Transport notified Middle East and the
Principal Sea Transport Officer, Egypt, of sailings; and Middle East notified
