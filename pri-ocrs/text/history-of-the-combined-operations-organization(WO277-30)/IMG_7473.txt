the Eighth Army Order of Battle for Sicily.
These could be nominated,
because that Order of Battle had been calculated on a generous scale, and
a fortnight after the end of the operations in the island, eight transpor
companies, a Petrol Depot, and other units, had not yet reached the island.
Initial maintenance was to be over the beaches.
Directly the beach-head
was sufficiently enlarged,
Divisional Maintenance Areas would be set up
by each division, that of 5 Division being nominated for development as
the first Corps F.M.C.
As soon as the ports on the straits were free of the
enemy, an Army Roadhead was to be set up, from which to replenish the
F.M.C.
The B.S.D. at Roadhead was to be stocked with 25,000 British
and 5.000 Indian Compo rations immediately it was sited.
As soon as the
feeding strength became stabilized; a reserve of two days, plus a working
margin of one day, would be built up and maintained.
In the meantime, in the period between the fall of Messina on 17th August
and the crossing of the straits, R.A.S.C. transport companies in Sicily were
engaged in heavy and continuous ammunition lifts in preparation for the
bombardment of the guns across the straits, over 173,000 rounds being
dumped.
A further life of at least 2,000 miles without repairs was specified as
the standard of vehicle fitness, and exchanges were made between com-
panies in order to bring all units nominated for the operation up to that
pitch.
S.T. Plan for Operation " Avalanche"
Initially, the British Services were not represented at H.O., Fifth (US)
Army, and 10 Corps administrative plans were made independently.
S.T. Order of Battle for this operation is shown in Appendix VK.

that from Middle East mostly in returnable cans.

S.T. Plan for Operation " Slapstick"
The Airborne Division force was to land in two main flights of about
4,000 men each, and only about 50 vehicles a flight.
Both flights were to
carry 48-hour rations, and Compo for ten days.
Supplies and P.O.L.
were to follow in a gradual build-up, from Sicily, North Africa, and Middle
East. The first flight of 8 Indian Division was due on 13th September, and
this formation would be maintained by Middle East for at least a month.
The rest of 5 Corps (1 Division, 2 N.Z. Division, and 25 Tank Brigade) were
to follow.

adition, the usual Corps and Divisional R.A.S.C. companies would join the
force.
The basis on which G.T. companies were provided was that the
Corps should be able to operate up to 150 miles from railhead or port.
Operation " Baytown"
The first flights of DUKWs began to operate the ferry service, which was
to go on for six days, at noon on D Day, and others discharged ships in
Reggio harbour.
