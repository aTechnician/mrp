use it as well, and he suggested landing supplies, ammunition and petrol a
the open beaches.
A thin trickle of these commodities was sent forward from Dunkit"
spite of appalling difficulties.
Roadheads were established, and even one tr

Two echelons of gun ammu

Ville sector, and this was quickly collected by the R.A.S.C. units which bi

brigades withdrew in different directions, or stood on widely separated fronts,
and divisional artillery was often widely dispersed.
R.A.S.C. sub-units had
often to operate independently of their parent units, with which touch was
easily lost.
Junior leaders had to act on their own initiative, and not wait for
orders.
Endurance and improvisation brought units through and enabled
them to maintain deliveries in the most adverse circumstances.
In addition,
the R.A.S.C. had often to take part in battle, thus emphasizing the necessity
for their being adequately trained to use their weapons.
By
20th or 21st May, the third line R.A.S.C.
had
ceased to operate
normally, and were employed in troop-carrying, clearing railhead depots, and
numerous other tasks.
The old automatic replenishment of ammunition and
petrol refilling points stopped, and this had serious consequences, as the
strain on the second line was greatly increased, units having to make very
long journeys to refill.
The strain on supply columns was as severe as on
other units,
modified only by the fact that, as they were both second and
third line, they were better able to adapt themselves to the conditions; but
there were many departures from normal operation of the double echelon
system.
It was very difficult to locate formations and units for whom supplies
were intended, often because of the failure of units to send guides, and supplies
were often dumped in the hope that they would reach those for whom they
were meant. At any rate, they reached someone.
In spite of formidable difficulties, R.A.S.C. transport units maintained
essential deliveries in all circumstances.
On 22nd and 23rd May, S.T.6 arranged for supply by air, and about 55
tons of rations were despatched and dropped in France.
It was impossible
to tell how much was collected by the B.E.F., or fell into enemy hands, or
was never found; but at least one lot of a number of sacks of preserved meat
and biscuit was found by a foraging party of a divisional supply column.
The
flights had to be discontinued owing to the casualties sustained by the aircraft
employed.
Dunkirk
The contraction of the area occupied by the B.E.F., and the progressive
shortening of its lines of communication, made it possible to dispense with a
number of administrative troops which were not required to continue the
battle. Many R.A.S.C. units were ordered to fall back; most of them received
orders to abandon their vehicles and march to the coast, and some were told
to destroy them, but the orders were not uniform.
There was a good deal of abandoned transport, both "B" and R.A.S.C.,
in and around Dunkirk, and the A.D.T., G.H.Q., who was the senior S.T.
representative there, collected them in an improvised V.R.D.
Drivers were
found for them among men waiting to be evacuated, and these vehicles,
well as all other R.A.S.C. vehicles entering Dunkirk, were sent to the docks
to clear supplies and ammunition.
There they were loaded and sent on their
way forward.
14 10-ton lorries of a L. of C. (Railhead) Company were an
invaluable addition to the transport resources of the port.
Convoys of food and ammunition continued to run, with a certain amount
of loss. The 10-tonner drivers did specially good work, but long before the
