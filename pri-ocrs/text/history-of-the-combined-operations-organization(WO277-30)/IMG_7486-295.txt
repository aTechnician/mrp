This meant that a number of
raditional units had to be met from United Kingdom resources, as desce of
in Chapter VIII.
The policy adopted throughout by S.T., A.F.H.Q., in order to make good
these losses of units, was one of dilution, and of the formation of fresh
units, the striking feature of this procedure being the capacity to train resa
organize so many different nations on the R.A.S.C. model.
Replica trans-
port companies and other unis wei formed from Tralian co-operators, the
fialian Army, and finally even civilians, to keep pace with the ever-growing
demands.
In all, 256 S.T. units were raised in this theatre.
In addition,
3-ton lorries were replaced by 6-ton and 10-ton lorries in certain companies,
providing an equivalent tonnage lift with fewer personte, and tralers were
provided to increase the lift of companies working at the Base.
Towards the end of 1944, the R.A.S.C. in Italy was called upon to
provide 3,400 non-tradesmen of A.1 medical category, under 30 years of
age and below the rank of corporal, for transfer to the Infantry.
In return,
low medical category men from other arms were received from the reallocation
centre, and were trained at the R.A.S.C. Training Depot in
Italy.
The
chief difficulty met in this scheme was the lack of potential drivers among
the replacement personnel.
The result was that, while the provision of
issuers never presented any difficulty, the number of replacement drivers pro-
duced was always less than that necessary.
As demands on the United
Kingdom for reinforcements were always very far short of full satisfaction
in numbers, this was a serious matter.
