(h) Use of Airborne Troops
The Havre-Calais area, which was most favourable from the point of view of air support
under a British-based fighter ' umbrella,'
was now heavily defended by the enemy.
smaller enemy guns of from 4 to 6 inches had all been sited so that they could defend their
own beaches.
The coast was shallow and so honeycombed with wire and pillboxes that
attack in this area was virtually impossible unless the German batteries could be mopped
up by airborne troops.
The Second Brigade of the British Airborne Division was now form-
ing and, on completion of this Division, it was hoped to form a second, but the bottleneck
was troop-carrying aircraft. It was vitally important that the maximum number of trained
airborne troops and aircraft should be available for the final operation.

the birthright of the Navy to the Army, decided that the Navy would play its part.
Consequently,
he sent Vice-Admiral A. Kent Hewitt to England to work with the C.C.O. in London to ensure
that the technique developed by the two Navies was the same.
It was Admiral Hewitt who
subsequently commanded the Western Naval Task Force in Operation " Torch" and the Western
Task Force in Operation "Husky."

" The Chief of Combined Operations in London has already a small staff containing

Navy and Army.
This staff is developing the special communications technique required

this staff should be developed into a Combined Organisation fully representative of both
American and British Services, with executive powers of decision and action.'
The Committee decided that :â€”

The Combined Signal Staff under the C.C.O. had prepared the lay-out of these ships and the
Admiralty had one in hand, H.M.S. Bulolo, almost completed at that time.

Thus it came about that, for all the landing subsequently carried out on the Continent,
the Combined Operations Organisation was responsible for the signal and W I communications,
both in the provision and design of material and in the training of the personnel.
C.C.O.s Interview with the President

British Chiefs of Staff for the re-entry into the Continent.

and the Chiefs of Staff.
propose recapitulating here what I told the Prime Minister.
I pointed out that you stressed the great need for American soldiers to be given an
opportunity
of fighting as soon as possible, and that you wished me to remind the Prime
Minister of the agreement reached last time he was in Washington,
that in the event of
things going very badly for the Russians this summer a sacrifice landing would be carried
out in France to assist them.
I pointed out that no landing that we could carry out could
draw off any troops, since there were some 25 German Divisions already in France and
landing craft shortage prevented our putting ashore an adequate number.
The Chief
German shortage lay in
fighter aircraft and all our efforts were being bent towards
provoking fighter battles in the West.
I said that you have asked for an assurance that we would be ready to follow up a
crack in German morale by landing in France this autumn and that I had given you an
assurance, that such an operation was being planned and was at present held at two months'
notice.
I pointed out that you disit wish to see a troitil asliers and ossi, possibly.
that a complete collapse of Russia had made a frontal attack on France impossible.
that you had asked whether we could not get a footing on the Continent some time this
year, even as late as December, in which case you would give the highest possible priority
to the production and shipping of landing craft, equipment and troops.
The need for
securing a port for supplying the troops made it clear that we should have to capture a port
such as Cherbourg and hold a suitable line such as the Cherbourg peninsula, possibly
expanding across towards St. Nazaire and eventually holding the whole of Brittany.
I made a point that you were sure that, in any case, when the operation came off we
should have to secure the Atlantic ports and not go rushing off in the direction of Germany
until we were firmly established, unless German morale had really cracked.
I pointed out that you did not like our sending out Divisions from England while

Mediterranean.
In the latter connection I told the P.M. how much you had been struck
in a recent telegram by his remark:
' Do not lose sight of ' Gymnast.'3
for European soldiers to fight in.
As the result of the recent losses inflicted by the U.S. Fleet on the Japanese Fleet,
particularly their aircraft carriers,
there was a general desire to take the offensive from
Australia, using the existing U.S. Marine forces and combat shipping.
General Marshall had suggested going for Timor and General MacArthur had telegraphed
on his own suggesting making for Rabaul.
I said that you and General Marshall were
anxious that two British aircraft carriers with their destroyer screen should join the American
naval forces in Australia to support these operations,
suggestion that the amphibious force which had assaulted Madagascar should be used for
operations against the Japanese. ...
I was so thrilled and heartened by all I saw in America, particularly by the American
Army, which is forging ahead at quite an unbelievable rate.
