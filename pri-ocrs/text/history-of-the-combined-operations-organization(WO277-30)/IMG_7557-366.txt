Civil Food Reserves
While War Office was not, of course, primarily responsible for the feeding
of civilians in overseas commands, it readily offered assistance in cases
where difficulties were encountered, either by the civilian authorities overseas
or by the Colonial Office in the United Kingdom, in maintaining the civilian
ration and food reserves.
It was the practice throughout the war for the
Colonial Office to keep the War Office informed as to the level of reserves,
and the supply situation generally affecting the civil authorities overseas.
As far as West Africa was concerned, problems were continually arising
on the maintenance of civilian reserves by the Colonial Office.
Although
the target was a 90-day reserve, this was not always kept up, and some
anxiety was felt when there was a possibility of French retaliation against
Sierra Leone and the Gambia for the Allied operations in North Africa.
The Resident Minister asked for additional shipping to restore the situation,
but, in fact, it was not this that was the crux of the matter, but the inadequate
discharge capacity at Freetown and Bathurst. It seemed as if the Admiralty,
the War Office, or the Colonial Office would have to forego shipping
space or a port of discharge, and that priorities would have to be re-
adjusted in favour of civil food.
No settlement was really reached, though
the menace receded before the situation became dangerous.

The number was only 150, but the precedent might have had
In view of the urgency for the completion of
the airfields, however, the War Office felt obliged to agree.
Military Reserves
Early in 1942, instructions regarding the reserves to be maintained in
West Africa were issued by the War Office.
They stressed that it was
absolutely essential that the full G.S. reserve was maintained in all four

the G.S. reserve of 90 days.
The G.S. reserve was later raised to 120 days.
Hitherto the working margin had only been
To avoid inter-
colonial transhipment, direct shipment to each colony from South Africa
should be asked for.
In order to avoid a breakdown of supplies, West
Africa should give South Africa an estimate of six months' requirements,
asking if the quantities required would be available.
Reserve Level Reviewed
The reserves to be held in the command were reviewed in January, 1945,
and S.T.6 resisted any reduction, on the grounds that there had been failures
in local supply which had necessitated protracted work in finding alternative
means of provision.
The additional time taken on this,

Later in 1945, the command reported that, owing to frequent unreliable
delivery of supplies from South Africa, and also to the late cancellation of
demands, it was impossible to maintain reserves, and even issues of items
in the ration scale.

was, therefore, proposed that demands should be placed on War Office, where
knowledge of the shipping situation and direct communication with South
Africa should enable difficulties, which could not be dealt with in the com-
mand, to be adjusted and overcome.
Shipments from U.S.A.
The policy of shipping supplies direct to West Africa from the U.S.A.,
when originally considered, was rejected, for the following reasons.
colonies, although when taken collectively they might repr√©sent a
substantial tonnage, became, when split up into four parcels, too small for
the British Food Mission in Washington to handle.
Most of the American
shipping only went to Freetown, and consignments would have to be trans-
shipped there for the other colonies.
Coastwise shipping was often not
available, and in any case unreliable.
Finally, the American shipping line
running to Freetown had curtailed their service drastically, as their ships were
held there for very long periods awaiting discharge, owing to congestion at

in the autumn of 1942.
