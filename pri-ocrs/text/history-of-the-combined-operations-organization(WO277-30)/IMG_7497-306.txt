was packed in containers, in order to cover the contingency that bomber
was at might be used to carry the freight, although it was hoped to use
Dakota aircraft as a normal procedure.
The balance was packed in airborne
panniers, or in bundles without special containers.
To enable
Emergency Supply to be brought into operation within 24
hours, to economize transport, and to form a cushion to meet sudden demands,
dumps were formed close to the airfields.
These contained 3,000 tons of the
commoner types of ammunition, and 2,500 tons of P.O.L.
was so near, it was unnecessary to hold Compo rations in the dump.
As the S.R.D.
As far as the relatively small commitment of Schedule Supply was con-
cerned, no special arrangements were considered necessary as, in this case,
stores were to come direct from depot to aircraft.
Further details of the
arrangements made in regard to supplies and P.O.L. are given later in this
chapter
A pool of General Transport Companies in the airfields area both met
the requirements of the Air Despatch organization, and could be called on by
D.D.S.T., Airborne Troops.
As the Air Despatch organization expanded and
the tempo of operations increased, the pool grew to six G.T. Companies,
under a C.R.A.S.C., War Office Transport Column.
S.T.3,
War Office was responsible for the control of the whole Air
Despatch organization, which was carried out through a control centre in War
Office, known as the Air Operations Room.
This held up-to-date states of
stocks in dumps, both pre-packed and unpacked, and of transport availability.
It acted as the centre in the War Office for the collection of all information
relating to supply and maintenance by air, and from it all S.T. activity in this
connection was co-ordinated.
It maintained direct communication with
Movement Control, War Office, regarding requirements of commodities to be
moved by air, and with air despatch for the actual arrangements involved.
An Air Freight Control Centre was set up, under R.A.F. auspices, in the
airfields area at which were located the R.A.F. group concerned and H.O,
Air Despatch R.A.S.C., with a small Movement Control staff.

A forecast of reguil dents of P.O.L. for maintenance by air of ground

Stocks to meet the com-
mitment were sent to packing areas, and were replenished from 9 Poom-
Depot. At the packing areas, P.O.L. was pre-packed in panniers.

9 Petrol Depot and by Eastern Command.
Arrangements by S.T. 6
The arrangements made by S.T. 6 to meet these commitments were as
follows: â€”
(a) Emergency supply by air.
A total of over 6 million Compo rations, together with nearly a
million water-sterilizing outfits and 350,000 A.F.V. rations, were ear-
marked at certain S.R.Ds.
(b) Maintenance of ground forces.
To meet the possible need for maintenance of normal ground forces
by air, five days' Compo rations for Brigade Group, and seven days'
Compo rations for an Infantry or Armoured Division were earmarked
at a S.R.D.
These would be drawn as required by C.R.A.S.C., Air
Despatch, for pre-packing and holding in packing areas near the supply
loading airfields.
The S.R.D. would automatically make up the ear-
marked stocks to the required level.
(c) Maintenance of airborne forces.
Five days' supplies for the two Airborne Divisions were held in dumps
near the supply loading airfields, under the control of H.O., Airborne
Troops.
These supplies were pre-packed in containers and panniers, and
consisted of Compo rations and certain miscellaneous items, such as
water-sterilizing outfits and anti-louse powder.
Seven days' maintenance, in the form of 24-hour rations and other
items. was issued for pre-packing bv S.A.S. brigade for their consump
