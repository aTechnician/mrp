(b) Amplit 9, Operations in 1943 from the United Kingdom.
(C.C.S. 167 and 169 and C.C.S., 68th Meeting
are three types of operation for which plans and preparations must be made :—*
We have examined the problem of amphibious operations from the United Kingdom in 1943. There
(i) Raids with the primary object of provoking air battles and causing enemy losses.
(i) Operations with the object of sering and holipit bridgehead and, if the state of German
morale and resources permit, of rigorously exploiting successes.
(ii) A return to the Continent to take advantage of German disintegration.
Plans and 1
reparations for (i) above will proceed as at present. An attack on the Channel Islands
s an example of the type of operation which we have in mind
We propose to prepare for an operation against the Cotentin Penition a with resources which wil
be available, the target date being set at the Ist August, 1943. This operation comes under type (il) above
We have agreed to establish forthwith a Combined Staff under a British Chief of Staff until such a
time as a Supreme Commander with an American Deputy Commander is appointed.
A directive to
govern the planning is in course of preparation.
We intend to include in this directive provision for
i return to the Continent under (i) above with the forces which will be available for the purpose in the
United Kingdom month by month.

Experience in North Africa has shown that a team of this
nature is of incalculable value.
If it is thought that it is prejudging the plan too much to
