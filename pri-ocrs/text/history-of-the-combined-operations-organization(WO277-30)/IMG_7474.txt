Maintenance was carried on through the Divisional Maintenance Area
system, stores being drawn direct from beach dumps until 10 Corps broke
out of the beach-head.
Thereafter, F.M.Cs. were established in the usual
wav.
In 10 Corps, the responsibility for the S.T. maintenance of formations
and Corps Troops under command was divided in the following manner: â€”
(a) C.R.A.S.C., Corps Troops, was responsible for delivering supplies
to formations, and made detailed issues of supplies and P.OL.

(b) C.R.A.S.C., Corps Transport Column, was responsible for delivering
P.O.L. to formations and to R.A.S.C. Corps Troops (for detailed
issue as above), and also controlled Corps transport.

Compo rations were issued until D+21 (30th September) when bulk

This deficiency was due to several causes; the accelerated build-up of
troops to meet the critical situation at the beach-head; unforeseen issues
to U.S. troops and Italians; and the dispersion of the disembarkation points

difficulty was experienced in obtaining sufficient M.T., but the railway
was in good condition, and a railhead was established behind the brigades.
Until the B.S.D. reached Taranto, the Divisional R.A.S.C. was responsible
for the passage of all stores from docks to railhead.
By 6th October,
the Divisional R.A.S.C. was operating two railheads, a Divisional Main-
tenance Area and four replenishment points.
By that time,
contact had
been made with 13 Corps, which proceeded to establish F.M.Cs., and the
normal system prevailed from then on.
Although sufficient transport was requisitioned to clear the ships and
to carry the supplies and P.O.L. obtained locally, there was never enough
for all requirements until the G.T. companies of the base organization
arrived.
This shortage resulted in one case in DUKWs having to be used
in a way for which they were never intended.
The speed and weight of
the advance up the east coast caused a crisis in the supply of P.O.L. which
could only be met at first (until a cased-petrol ship could be diverted to
Taranto) by rushing supplies from the west coast, where stocks were ample.
One company used for this purpose was the DUKW company from Sapri
which sent 70 amphibians loaded with P.O.L, across the peninsula, which is
about 80 miles wide at that point.
These were followed by convoys made
up of vehicles of all kinds.
The roads across the Apennines were bad, and
made worse by diversions to get round demolished bridges, and by rain.

Base Ports
The allotment of base ports to the British and Americans respectively
was governed primarily by the fact that the Eighth Army was on the east
side of the peninsula, and the Fifth (U.S.) Army on the west, but it was
impossible to reserve ports for one or the other.
Thus, the presence of
Brish formations ne port for Army necessitated the discharge of mish
stores at west coast ports.
Again, the only serviceable railway from the
base area to the Bighph Army aria started from Naples, which caused the
discharge of a large part of the British maintenance at that port.
