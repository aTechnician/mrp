Neither G.H.Q., Middle East, nor O.C., R.A.S.C., Khartum, knew
anything about this reserve, which was spread over 32 locations, in 4-galon
non-returnable tins, which were oiled to prevent leakage and corrosion.
In September,
1940, an A.D.S.T., an R.A.S.C. officer, was sent to take
charge of the S.T. services in the Sudan.
Although the greater part of the
work in connection with these services was carried out by R.IA.S.C. units,
the Directorate Staff was composed of R.A.S.C. officers, except for the
D.A.D.T., who was R.I.A.S.C.
Developments in Sudan in 1940
After Italy entered the war, plans were approved for the establishment
of Base Supply Depots at Khartum and Atbara, and R.A.S.C. officers were
sent to Port Sudan and other places, but without any staff.
In September,
1940, the situation improved with the arrival of a number of R.I.A.S.C.
supply units, which were used to establish a Base Supply Depot at Khartum,
an Advanced Supply Depot at Atbara, and a Transit Supply Depot at Port
Sudan.
Field Supply Depots were also set up at various points to maintain
the troops confronting the Italians.
Supplies began to arrive to build up
reserves to 150 days for 8,000 British and 16,500 Indian troops, and the situ-
ation was difficult until an Indian Base Supply Depot arrived, and took over

In addition to the Indian transport companies, there were also four

To supplement M.T. and to try and reduce
leakage, petrol was sent up by camel convoys, hired for the purpose, and
at one time these were working in an almost continuous stream.
It was found essential to centralize the control of all transport under
"Q" Staff, in order to settle conflicting claims of the services.

A hastily formed M.T. company was sent from Egypt in February, 1941,
with the object of retrieving and operating captured Italian vehicles, the
number of which that could be quickly brought into service having been
optimistically but inexpertly estimated at 100.

In this connection, it may be mentioned here that an animal transport com-

later employed in the Gondar area, lifting stores about 20 miles beyond

By about the time the main attack was launched on Keren, the railway

During the campaign, there were no P.O.L. depots, as such, in the forward

the Indian Army practice, except for a detachment of the Indian Petrol
