leak, could use the alternative lines, and so isolate the faulty section for repair.
Distribution of P.O.L.
As the armies advanced, the pipeline system was steadily extended, at
the rate of about three and a quarter miles a day, and connected up with
available bulk storage.
The filling centre near Rouen now proved to be too
far back, owing to the difficulty of returning empty jerricans.
Filling centres
were therefore set up in the Advance Base area, and, in November, the Mobile
Petrol Filling Centres controlled by Army were withdrawn and placed under
G.H.Q. control, which left Armies with no responsibility for filling jerricans.
In addition to the pipelines, the Belgian and French canal systems were
extensively used for the distribution of P.O.L., and 10,000 tons of bulk
P.O.L. barges were at the disposal of S.T.
It was agreed that the routing of
these barges should be done entirely by S.T.
Special requirements of P.O.L. were the supply of fuel for the fog-
dispelling apparatus on airfields, known as "Fido", which consumed 90,000
gallons a night; and a squadron of the R.A.F., operating jet planes, required
3,000 gallons of kerosine a day.
P.O.L. Containers
After the break-through, and the subsequent advance to the Dutch
frontier,
the supply of returnable containers had considerably diminished,
causing such a serious shortage that special arrangements had to be made
for their collection, and over a million were collected in a month.
War Office had agreed to maintain a minimum production of l4 million
non-returnable containers a month for M.T. 80 spirit, and also held a reserve
of 30,000 tons of M.T. 80 in non-returnable containers.
In consequence,
M.T. 80 in these tins was imported in order to improve the situation, and by
the middle of November the average daily imports had risen to 2,750 tons.

Operation " Goldflake"
This operation was the move of 1 Canadian Corps and 5 British Divisio
from Italy to 21 Army Group, and began during February, 1945. 21 Arm
Group asked for additional non-divisional troons to cover the reauirements
i these formations, bie unipovey was enunciated by War Office hatens
intes in administrative units was precluded, and any such units whichay
Amy Group considered essential must either be given up by the theatr from
chich a formation came, or else be provided from 21 Army Group resouros.
The demands for transport were considered justifiable, but it was realized
that, in certain cases, notably in respect of G.T. Companies, the theatre might
rot be able to surrender the total numbers required, and 21 Army Group
would therefore have to meet the difference.
Eventually, in addition to
formation second line transport, the following transport units accompanied
the formations from Italy: â€”11 G.T. Companies, seven Artillery Platoons.
one Tank Transporter Company, one Bulk Petrol Transport Company, one
Bridge Company, and one Ambulance Car Company.
A "C" Type Petrol Depot also arrived.
From the supplies aspect, the chief problem was the provision in 21 Army
Group of the additional supply units required, there being almost no resources
in the United Kingdom from which they could be produced.
It was difficult for the War Office to assess accurately the respective loads
borne by the supply units of 21 Army Group and A.F.H.Q., owing to the lack
of detailed local knowledge and information.
The ration strength of 21
Army Group was 1,200,000, that under A.F.H.Q., 1,400,000, while the con-
templated transfer amounted to 170,000.
To meet its increased commitments,
21 Army Group asked for four B.S.Ds., six mobile field bakeries, three field
butcheries and C.S.Ds., and two D.I.Ds.
The claim for bakeries was thought
crossive by War Office; but one was offered by A.F.H.Q., and two could
with difficulty be taken from the bread-producing force in the United King-
dom. The B.S.Ds. and D.I.Ds. could not be found, but the field butcheries
iere covered by three, included in the order of battle, but not yet sent to
21 Army Group.
While the demand seemed extravagant, it had to be remembered that the
nation strength of 21 Army Group was forecast to rise, in the comparatively
neat future, to no less than two million.
