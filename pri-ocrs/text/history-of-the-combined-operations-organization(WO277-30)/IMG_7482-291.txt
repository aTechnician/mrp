Cothat time, they were called upon to take part in an operation, which was

Pack Transport
The campaign in Italy could not have been fought without pack trans-
port.
Long-term planning had, indeed, been going on in
the War Offic
during 1943 in regard to the provision of pack transport for mountain
warfare in a Mediterranean theatre, but this did not result in any pack
transport units being made available from the United Kingdom for the
first winter in Italy.
The need for such transport soon became apparent,
and two North African companies were sent over, but they could not cover
more than a small sector of the mountainous front.
Companies were there-

A third North African company was followed by seven Indian and six
-ypriot companies from the Middle East, further Italian Army units, and a
forth African company with Italian muleteers
These units did very good work in the appalling weather of the fit
winter, but worse was to come the next winter in the mountains south of
Roloona, when, in order to meet the severe conditions of sumply obtaining,
two more Italian Pack Transport Groups of four companies each were
formed, making a total of 13 Italian Army companies.

Mule Leading
It was considered that, if sufficient manpower had been available, all
Pack Transport Companies should have had one man for each mule, instead
of one man for two mules as was the allowance in this campaign.
A good
many mules were lost through falling down mountainsides, and some of
these accidents might not have happened if the animals had been individually
It was found to be better to untie the second mule from the first, and
let it follow.
Another advantage of the increased scale of drivers would be
that, in times of good going, it would allow one man to restâ€”an important
point, as the men usually became more exhausted than the mules.
It is
worth noting that the Germans and Italians considered one man for each
mule essential, while the French
companies kept sufficient surplus

to send forward when the terrain made this advisable.
It was found that
the best method of preventing a stampede was dispersion, and hobbles were
seldom, if ever,
used in Italy.
Even if each hobble had a quick release,
there might be delay in getting animals off the line.
Dispersion was also the
best protection against falling fragments of A.A. shells, which caused more
mule casualties than direct enemy air attack.
Pack Distribution Centre
Lack of specialized knowledge of pack transport equipment among
R.A.O.C. personnel in Italy made it necessary to attach a R.A.S.C. saddler
serjeant to Ordnance to supervise the sorting of equipment.
A special
unit, called a Pack Distribution Centre, was also formed to speed up the
time between indent and delivery.
It consisted of one officer, trained in
pack duties, an issuer, and a clerk.
Ordnance agreed to hold a substantial
stock of expendable stores at Army Railhead, and it was arranged that
all indents should be roassed to Ordnance through the Centre, which held
a reserve, and issued the stores immediately, re-imbursing itself when the
indents were met by Ordnance.
The officer i/c of the centre kept in touch
with Pack Groups and units, and if necessary rationed the available stores
to ensure that all got a fair share.
He also developed production from local
resources.
