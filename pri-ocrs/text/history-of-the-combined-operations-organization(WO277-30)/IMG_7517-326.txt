Going the week ending 9th September, 16,000 tons of petrol and 300 tons of
Durines were delivered; the next week, priority switched to ammunition, of
which 2,300 tons were delivered,
together with 800 tons of petrol and 300
tons of supplies.

Air Supply services from airfields in the Swindon area moved to Essex, so as
to be nearer the Continent, in consequence of the successful progress of
operations in N.W. Europe.
This required the move of a considerable
portion of the Army Air Despatch organization, not only of the personnel,
but also of existing pre-packed dumps; and the latter had to be re-formed in
the new area.
The airborne invasion of Holland was the first major test of air mainten-
ance operations.
1 Airborne Division was supplied in daylight on the four
days following D-day, and 475 sorties were flown with pre-packed stores
ejected by R.A.S.C. two-men despatch crews, who suffered casualties of 165
missing and 37 wounded, or over 20 per cent.
Operation " Market Garden"
This operation consisted of two parts; the airborne invasion of Holland,
known as Operation " Market", and the ground operations connected with
the
airborne landings,
which
were known as
Operation
" Garden".
"Market" was the famous Arnhem operation.
The operation had to begin at a time when the administrative resources
were barely able to support it.
The estimates of rail and other capacities had
proved too optimistic, with the results that although it was supported with is
major requirements of rations, petrol and ammunition, this was only achieved
at the expense of other requirements of Second Army and First Canadian
Stocks in the roadhead concerned were low, and the lines of communicat

The administrative build-un was not helned by the necessity for using

Maintenance Arrangements
The two U.S. Airborne Divisions engaged in Operation "Market" were
maintained from British stocks as far as common user items, e.g, P.O.L. and
supplies, were concerned, although later U.S. rations were issued.
It was the
plan that the airborne formations should be maintained by air from D-Day
(ie, 17th September) to D +5; but arrangements were also made to main-
tain the U.S. Divisions by land from D-Day in an emergency, and 1 Airborne
Division similarly from D+3.
With the exception of Guards Armoured Division, which was ordered to
hold eight days' supplies and 200 miles of P.O.L., and all Corps Troops, which
vere restricted to four days' supplies and 150 miles of P.O.L., all the forma-
tions within 30 Corps which were to make contact with the airborne forces
vere to hold six days' supplies and 250 miles of P.O.L. for each vehicle. They
vere also ordered to carry double second line holdings of 25-pr, ammunition,
but were warned that they might have to carry on with depleted second line
holdings after that, owing to shortage of stocks.
Course of the Operation
All three divisions
made successful landings, and simultaneously the
Second Army attacked on the ground.
The automatic drop of supplies for
all the airborne formations was successfully carried out.
The next day, the
maintenance by air of 1 British Airborne Division was not successful, owing
to intense anti-aircraft fire making the dropping inaccurate.
Contact was
esablished by the land forces with the U.S. Divisions, but not with the British
Division.
All three continued to be supplied by air, although not adequately,
