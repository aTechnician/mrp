My dear Brethren,
We are going to sing the " Ie Deun", hymn of thanksgiving to
the divine Justice for our liberation.
Since the mourful days of 1940, we have not ceased to put our
confidence in the Providence who had to upheld our cause which was
of Right and Justice.
" In te Domine, speravi non confundar in aeternun. "
We had also confidence in the power of the Royal Navy and in the
proverbiale tenacity of England. We have not been deceived.
To day, we sing in great joy:
First of all, glory be to God, Sovereign Master of the events.
Glory be to the allies, powerful workers of our liberation!
Glory be to our Dead, to our soldiers and to the patriots of the
resistance!
We pray to God to continue his protection on the allies armies
so that they will soon bring us, with complete victory, Peace and
Security for the future.
Peace end Security garented by Force to the service of Right and
Justice.
Long live the Allies!
Long live England!
Long live Belgium!
