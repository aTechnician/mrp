Unit HQ 21 Ipt Coln RASC.
Commanding Officer It. Col. H.B. HOPCRO
Before embarking CRASC arranged with CRAF 101 Beach Sub Area that RAF
repeir sections would be attached to G.T. Coys Workshops until the RAP
Repair Seotions could commence their operations role.
Very able and willing assistance was given at all times by the RAF
personnel.
1 Officer CF/It F. BAKER and 17 ORs of M.T. Light Repair Seotion No. 101
RAF Beach Flight were attached to 101 Coy G.I.
The high standard of
workmanship and assistance given undoubtedly helped to mintain the DUKVs
in a seaworthy condition at a very critical stage of the operation.
1 Officer (Flt. Lieut. J. PINDER) and 18 ORs of M.T. Light Repair Section
No102 RAF Beach Flight were attached to 39
GT Coy.
Their enthusiasm and
skill in co-operating with the RASC Wksps personnel
was such that no veh
was VOR for 48 hrs unless it was a complete '2' Casualty.
In addition
F//It PINDER carried on the control and organisation of the
Wesps, when the
Wksps Offr Capt. DAVIES was killed by enemy action JUN 12.
At all times
100% properation, yas achieved between the two Servioes personnel.
