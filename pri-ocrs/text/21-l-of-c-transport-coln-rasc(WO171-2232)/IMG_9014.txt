Summary of Events and Information
Three shelle "lapded" between IST 381 and IST 382. Counterfire by HAS Verspite
apparently silenced the Enemy Guns.
IST. 382 dropped anabor on time. All the Flotilla were in position approximately
2 miles offshore at 12.30 the order was received for "DUKWe" to swim ashore, Ahl
CRASC went ashore on the first DUKW where Adit and SET Rep 5 Beach Gp contacted.
CRASC and reported details of recce of G.I. Park.
DUKWs which were now swimming
ashore were ordered to come in.
The beach was under Mortar fire and small arms fire from snipers. All the DUKVa.
although very low in the stern (due to the fact that they were loaded with
3tons-1 3owts preloaded stores) were successfully brought ashore. One only was
struck by Mortar fire as it reached the edge of the beach, the driver received
a fractured jaw and was evacuated.
Bringing all the DUKWs ashore successfully was a great achievement in view of
the heavy preload carried, the heavy swell on the sea, and the fact that ISTs.
anchored 2 miles out..
Great credit must be given to the drivers concerned.
