must not be so rapid that the release of British troops would thereby be impeded;
and that in
any given period the proportion of local troops released should be
roughly equal to the proportion of British troops released.
Similarly, the benefits
authorized under British Release Regulations were clearly unsuitable for universal
The civilian outfit needed by a Jewish citizen of
Pallication to local terent from that needed by a Nigerian or a Sudaise a d
commanders were asked to draw up the schedule of benefits suitable to the local
conditions and the needs of the different types and races, taking as their criterion
that the individual should return to his home properly equipped to resume his
normal life in his usual surroundings.
The wisdom of this method was fully
borne out by events and the release of these troops went on without any difficulty.
The demobilization scheme was, beyond question, successful in achieving a very
difficult operation without major trouble.
Fortunately, every attempt to change
the fundamentals of the scheme while it was in operation was defeated, and the
confidence of the men was kept throughout.
However slow the rate of release may
have seemed, it was always clear that release was going on by an orderly succession
of groups.
The man in Group 64 might see an announcement which gave the
release date for Group 63 and be sure that the next announcement would cover his
group; he was not fearful that before his turn came the whole basis of the scheme
would be changed and that his cherished hopes would vanish.
No promise was made that was not kept.
In the early days of release much
trouble was caused by unauthorized statements in the Press, but blunt denials in
Parliament quickly had a very salutary effect and it was soon apparent that releases
did in fact happen at the rate given in official statements.
Finally, the machine itself worked well. The staffs of dispersal centres took
great pride in their units, and men and women who came thither for releases were
greatly surprised at the speed, efficiency and courtesy they encountered and the
comfort of the accommodation. Much credit is due to those officers and men who
took so much trouble to make the machine work, and to ensure that their comrades
had a pleasant journey home.
