PREFACE
It would be a simple matter to compose quite a lengthy volume about Manpower
in the Army during the Second World War by setting out an account in strict
chronological order of the intake and wastage month by month, fitting in to their
appropriate places in the sequence those major events, such as the introduction of
selection testing and the formation of the General Service Corps, which had
marked effects on manpower. But the result would probably be about as interest-
ing as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and would develop into a mere recitation of
statistics which are now of very little importance since the conditions to which
they related are gone beyond recall. It no longer matters greatly what was the
Army's maximum strength during the war: what is interesting is to enquire how
the Army's growth was regulated, how and why was a maximum limit imposed,
how did the Army get the men it was allowed to have and what did it do with them.
In this volume, therefore, the method of strictly chronological narrative has been
altogether abandoned, and the many problems relating to manpower are considered
in a series of chapters each of which deals with one particular aspect.
The first
and last chapters form a prologue and an epilogue, the one describing conditions
before the war and the other dealing with demobilization which began on 18th
June, 1945, six weeks after V.E. Day. The second chapter deals with general
questions, such as intakes and their allocation, the machinery of call-up and the
methods of regulating the strength of the Army. The remaining chapters deal
with particular aspects of manpower problems, the supply of tradesmen, the supply
of officers, the use of manpower from outside the United Kingdom, drafting and
wastage.
Few figures have been quoted in the text, and such statistics as seem
necessary for illustration of particular points have been relegated to Appendices,
where they need be encountered only by those who wish to refer to them.
dictum of Callimachus that "a great big book is a great big evil" has been constantly
in mind; only major questions have been dealt with and no attempt has been made
to follow in detail the fortunes of any particular arm or corps, either in expansion
or in demobilization.
The book makes no startling revelations and no sensational scandals are now
brought to light, but it does set out the considerations which lay behind certain
courses of official action and which could not have been explained during the war
for obvious security reasons.
Many actions, such as the raising of infantry
battalions in haste and their later disbandment or conversion to other arms, or the
constant transfer of individuals from one arm to another, will appear to be due to
some reason and not to mere caprice.
A great Greek historian long ago remarked
that reasons are more interesting than facts, and it is hoped that some interest will
be found in studying the causes which led to certain decisions on manpower
problems, and the consequence that flowed therefrom.
But the book is not thereby intended as an apologia for the War Office or for
anyone else.
To explain is not necessarily to justify and tout comprendre may
mean tout condamner just as much as tout pardonner.
Some of the criticism
directed at the War Office was illogically based on argument from the particular to
