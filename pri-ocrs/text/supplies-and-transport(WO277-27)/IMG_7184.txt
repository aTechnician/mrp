SOLIDIFIED PETROL
Among other experiments in respect of the carriage of petrol by air, both
Ket Office and G.H.Q., India, were, in the early part of 1944, investigating the
arous technical questions arising from the possible use of solidified petrol
The advantages of its use would be reduced fire risk and reduced loss in
mansi, but this would depend on the provision of a robust and airtight package.
The disadvantages were that, since the process of solidification involved the
se of special plant operated under expert chemical control, it was necessarily
nufactured at main refineries, and shipped in solid form, thus losing the
ray well-known advantages obtained by importing and distributing liquid
febin bulk ; that only about 92 per cent. by weight of the solid was petrol, of
hich only 85 per cent., on the average, was recoverable after pressing ; that
riving forces must be equipped with the necessary presses for liquefaction,
and with containers to receive the liquefied petrol; and that a straight-run

Standard M.T. 80 spirit was, therefore, unsuitable.
Plant for the solidification of petrol in considerable quantities was available,
ind production on a commercial scale was a practical proposition, as was also

The problem of producing suitable lightweight equipment for liquefying
wid petrol in the field was not satisfactorily solved at that time, although the
nel- ranian Oil Company were working on the design of a portable manually
prated machine for field use, and were also considering the design of a larger
ret-driven unit for continuous working which could be carried in a 3-ton
A limiting factor was the availability of the plasticising agent, which was
to used successfully in the solidifying process, namely, urea formaldehyde.
i was in short world supply, and was used in the manufacture of an important

aly of this substance would govern production of solid petrol.
As regards containers, a suitable package to enable solidified petrol to be
iropped from aircraft had been designed.

For all these reasons it was decided that no woofal munase cout he achieved
