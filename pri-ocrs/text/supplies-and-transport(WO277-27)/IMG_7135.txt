Notes.—1.
The final form of the ration
was reached after a series of amendments spread
over the period of four years, most of which were reductions, except for the increases of butter
or margarine, and oatmeal.
2. From July, 1917, there was a L. of C. ration which was smaller than the forward area
ration in respect of meat, bread, bacon, cheese, sugar and tea.
3. The value of the 1914 ration was 4,400 calories, and that of the 1918 ration about 4,040
calories, L. of C. 3,330.
