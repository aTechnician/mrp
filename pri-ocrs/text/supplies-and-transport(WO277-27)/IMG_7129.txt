(b) Continued Maintenance.
The following calculations indicates the monthly
tonnage left
available for consideration in connection with Civil Affairs food-
stuffs,
during the continued maintenance of " Overlord":
Monthly capacity, as in Part 1, above
Deduct : Maintenance for all military
T10,000 tons
180,000 tons
purposes, as in Part 3, above.
Reserve capacity
10,000 "
Balance
120,000 tons
60,000 ,
Allowing for intake and output, this balance would allow 1,000
tons of foodstufis daily for Civil Affairs, and C.P.O. (F.S.) con-
sidered that this represented the maximum tonnage which should be
considered for planning purposes.
On consideration of this appreciation, no difficulties were dis-
covered in respect of the labour, movements, and transportation
tasks involved.
The above may be compared with the account
of S.R.Ds. and M.S.Ds. in Chapter XII.
