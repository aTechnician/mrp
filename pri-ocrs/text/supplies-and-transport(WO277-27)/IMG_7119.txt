7. Method 4 (c) is a logical evolution from 4 (b).
If a proportion of first
line load-carriers is to be organized for work under the co-ordination of the
C.R.A.S.C., many administrative and operational difficulties could be obviated
by manning them with R.A.S.C. personnel.
There would be distinct ad-
vantages in the provision of reinforcements and the maintenance of vehicles.
8. It is clear that the problem is in effect one of organization policy, the
fundamental question being whether, in the interests of economy as well as
efficiency, the heavier load-carriers
of first line
transport should
become
more the responsibility of the R.A.S.C. than of the units of the various
Arms concerned.
If this is accepted, it remains to determine to what extent
the responsibility must be altered and by what means.
Note.— When the above paper was considered by the D.S.T's. standardi-
zation conference,
which included senior R.A.S.C.
officers with experience
in a variety of operational theatres of war, the following points emerged: —
(a) First line transport scales required examination, and might be reduced.
(b) There was generally great difficulty in obtaining first line transport,
and when it was available it was rarely properly organized.
(c) Opinion was in favour of a proportion of " B
being driven by R.A.S.C. and organized on R.A.S.C. lines.
