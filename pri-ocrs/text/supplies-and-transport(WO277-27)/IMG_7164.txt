44. Armoured Fighting Vehicle (A.F.V.) Ration Pack
The A.F.V. pack was essentially a reserve ration to be carried in armoured
fighting vehicles and certain ancillary vehicles, and for other troops accompany-
ing A.F.Vs. in circumstances where they might be cut off temporarily from
second line supplies. Special metal boxes were fitted in the A.F.Vs. to carry
a three days' reserve for the crew; e.g., a tank with a five-men crew had three
No. 3 size ration boxes, each of which was fitted with one A.F.V. S-men ration
pack ; but one 2-men and one 3-men pack would not fit a No. 3 size box, and
demands had to be regulated accordingly.
The A.F.V. packs were only to be
consumed when normal supplies could not be delivered by second line transport,
otherwise armoured formations were fed in the same way as other troops.
The A.F.V. (2-men) pack, new type, was also suitable for operations in
mountain warfare in temperate climates for suhsistence of troops engaged off
the axis for short periods of two or three days.
The composition and packaging of the A.F.V. Ration Pack were as follows.
A description of the original tune of the nack is included for nurdoses of com
parison; for reasons of snace only the ?-men nack of that tune is described,
the 3-men and 5-men nante were of cimilar commacition hut pronartionately
