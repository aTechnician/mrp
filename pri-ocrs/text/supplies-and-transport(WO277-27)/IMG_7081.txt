3. The scale did not provide for special local conditions, e.g.,
issuers delivering supplies
to units without transport, awkward lay-out of depot, reserves held, abnormal guard duties,
etc., and these would necessitate extra personnel.
2. Extension of Scale to cover depots with ration strengths above 20,000,
as promulgated in November, 1942.
(a) The following table, showing the scales allowed to provide for depots
with feeding strengths over 20,000, was based on the assumption that the
average number of units for every 1,000 of feeding strength was four.
When
the number of units dependent on a depot gave a higher or lower average,
increases or decreases were to be applied.
