(ii) Cost of monthly maintenance and upkeep of reserves :—
In jerricans
£145,000
In tins, cases, etc.
£588,000
Difference in favour of jerricans
£443,000
iii) Therefore, difference in initial outlay on jerricans would be recovered
in (2,763,000 divided by 443,000) months = 64 months.
There-
after there will be a saving of £443,000 a month.
(b) Transportation advantages. —The comparison of road, rail and sea
transportation tonnages between Middle East Bases, depots and consuming
areas was estimated as follows :-
(i) Jerrican : 2,895,000 containers at 10-1b. each = 12,900 tons monthly
(ii) 4-gallon tins : 3,180,000 tins at 2½-lb. each =
3,560 tons monthly
477,000 cases, etc., at 3-lb. each
640 tons monthly
27 per cent. of 27,150,000 gallons wasted reserves
=678,750 gallons.
20 per cent. of 12,735,000 gallons wasted main-
tenance = 2,547,000 gallons.
Total = 3,225,750 gallons
Therefore, the monthly reduction in shipping tonnage to the Middle East
roud be 17,130 tons les$ 9,500 tons = 15,700 tons, of which 10,750 tons would
te anker tonnage, and 4,950 tons general cargo tonnage.
(c) Saving in manpower.—The number of men required to make 290,000
nd ill 2,90,00 erricans a month was estimated to be considerably less than
the number required to make and fill the 4,155,000 4-gallon tins required a
month, and to case 30 per cent, of them; but no useful calculation was possible
at that stage until more was known regarding the working of plant for making
erricans.
12,900 tons
17,100 tons
Monthly
Therefore, advantage in favour of jerrican, 4,200 tons monthly.
In actual practice the balance in favour of the jerrican was expected to be
very much greater than was indicated by the above figures, because it would
be possible to fill this type of container much nearer the area of consumption
than it was possible to fill the 4-gallon tins.
The latter process was, for all
practical purposes, restricted to the vicinity of the producing tinplants, whilst
the filling of the jerrican could be carried out at any point to which bulk petrol
could be conveyed in appreciable quantities.
The difference in dead weight tonnage as between bulk and packed petrol
for purposes of conveyance was, approximately, 30 per cent. in favour of bulk.
(c) Importation advantages.—Monthly tonnages of materials for container
manufacture were estimated as follows :—
(i) Jerrican.—Material for replacement of 20
per cent. of
1,450,000 containers in circulation, at 10-lb. a con-
tainer + 1-lb. for incidental material ..
(ii) 4-gallon tins : —
Material for 3,180,000 tins and 477,000 cartons
Material for 5 per cent. of 6,790,000 tins (leakers) from
reserve holdings
24 per cent. of 27,150,000 gallons petrol, etc., wasted
from reserve holdings
Material for 20 per cent. of tins and cartons for main-
tenance, lost as leakers
20 per cent. of 12,735,000 gallons petrol, etc., lost as
leakage in maintenance
Total, for 4-gallon tins
1,430 tons
4,610 tons
850 tons
2,260 tons
920 tons
8,490 tons
17,130 tons
