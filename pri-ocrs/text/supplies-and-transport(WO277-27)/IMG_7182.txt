APPRECIATION OF THE COMPARATIVE
MERITS OF
THE
"JERRICAN" AND THE 4-GALLON TIN
1. Basis of Calculations
(a) Forces.-20 Divisions, at 5,500 vehicles and 40,000 men each.
(b) Consumption :-
Petrol and DERV, 5 gallons for each vehicle a day.
Kerosine, 0-6 gallons a man a month.
(c) Packed Reserves :-
Petrol/DERV, 45 days ..
gallons

4•4 gallons.
Cost 2 dollars, say, 10s. Od.
Leakage in store, nil ; leakage in transit insignificant.
Little or no dunnage required.
4-gallon tin.
Cost 1s. 6d., but 30 per cent. of total production had to
be cased, and cases/cartoons cost 4s. Od. a pair of tins.
consignments had to be dunnaged; but cost of dunnage was not
recorded, as it was difficult to arrive at a true figure for each container.
Dunnage costs in Egypt alone at that time were about £5,000 a month.
Leakage losses inevitable.
The cost of petrol lost by leakage, and the
wastage of the containers was chargeable against the provisioning
cost for containers.
