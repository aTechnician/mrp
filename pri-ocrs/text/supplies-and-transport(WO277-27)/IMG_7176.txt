5. From United Kingdom to Continent
(a) Packed petroleum products.
In the early stages all P.O.L. shipped with
and for the maintenance of the Force will be in heavy gauge 4-gallon containers
carried in petrol carrier ships.
This is essential for ease of handling in beach
maintenance areas, and to reduce the risk of fire from leaky packages.
It will
also permit the establishment on the Continent of a returnable can " popula-
tion" to enable bulk supplies, when introduced, to be distributed to consumers.
(b) Shipping in bulk.
Bulk distribution will be introduced as soon as
possible into the theatre of operations.
Sea movement of oils in bulk calls
initially for small tankers capable of working in shallow and restricted waters.
Later, it may be possible to deliver direct from large tanker ships to shore
installations.
(c) Harbour working self-propelled oil lighters. Responsibility fovilbe
vision is that of the Admiralty in conjunction with D.S.T.
These craft will be
available for port and harbour working between tankers and storages.
They
will be operated by Motor Boat Companies, R.A.S.C.
(d) Cross-channel submarine pipelines.
