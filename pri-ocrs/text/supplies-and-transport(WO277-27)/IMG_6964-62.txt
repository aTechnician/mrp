Units that had not been able to give sufficient attention to this essential part
of their training paid the price.
So also did the animals, which were sometimes
treated with a great lack of consideration, over-loaded, ill-loaded, and kept
under load unnecessarily long.
Each animal normally carried its own rations
for er day and its picketting gear, perhaps 10 or 15lb. in addition to its
standard payload of 160-1b.

Owing to the shortage of mules, ponies and donkeys had to be used
instead, but they were not popular or altogether satisfactory substitutes.
The
donkeys proved stubborn under fire, and this was apt to be awkward for the
drivers.

in Chapter X.
P.O.L. Supply
The problems of supply and distribution of P.O.L. in this campaign were
more complex and difficult of solution than those experienced in any other
Every known means of transportation was employed for the con-
veyance of this commodity.
The extension of pipelines was carried forward
as far as this was practicable. By the end of 1944, the American 6-inch line
from Calcutta to Dibrugarh had been completed; the line from Chittagong to
Chandranathpur had reached Comilla, and the final link was in progress; the
extension of the line from Manipur to Imphal was proceeding; the American
line from Calcutta to Kunming had reached Myitkyina in October; and the
construction of the second American 6-inch line from Chittagong to Tinsukia
This had assisted greatly with the improvement in the situation in respect
of the supply of P.O.L. which had been achieved during 1944. Other methods
were a decrease in consumption, and increasing bulk storage and means of
distribution. Storage at Chittagong was increased from i1 million to 20
The capacity of tankage at airfields and army depots was
increased by 32 million gallons, and that of rail tank wagons by
In spite of these measures, however, the position of A.L.F.S.E.A. in
respect of stocks of P.O.L. was never very secure throughout the campaign
for the re-occupation of Burma, During February, March and April, 1945,
stocks of most main grades represented only 15 days' consumption.

gallons in April, 1944, to 34 million in April, 1945.

As described in Chapter X, the position in regard to P.O.L. equip-
ment was being rectified from the United Kingdom as fast and as far as cir-

carried bulk spirit to China in
special tanker aircraft; but S.E.A.C. wished to avoid this method, no doubt
because it meant that such aircraft could not be switched to carry other loads.
As light metal tanks suitable for fitting in the commoner types of transport
aircraft could not be obtained, P.O.L. for transport by air for British forces
continued to be packed in jerricans and barrels.
Another method considered
was the use of solidified petrol, which is discussed in Appendix XM.
The 620-gallon tank, besides its normal uses, was considered to be suit-
able for use in all types of amphibian vehicle to meet a requirement for
amphibian bulk petrol carriers.
After the recapture of the oilfields in Central Burma, their exploitation
on a short-term basis was undertaken by the civilian oil company on behalf
of A.L.F.S.E.A. to ease the situation in that area until the supply of spirit
was possible from Rangoon.
This proved a most valuable asset in an area
most difficult and expensive to supply.
Using Japanese and other equip-
ment found on the spot, this expedient eventually produced up to 12,000
gallons of M.T. spirit a day.
Catering Services Re-organized
The catering services in S.E.A.C. were reorganized during the second
half of 1944, the main features of this process being the formation of a pool
of officers and N.C.Os., both British and Indian, to assist and advise in regard
to catering problems for both British and Indian troops; the formation of
three emergency cookery training centres; and the establishment of an Army
School of Cookery.
A team of Indian cooks also toured the command for
the purpose of demonstrating to Indian units the correct methods of preparing
and cooking dried goat meat and dehydrated vegetables.
The attention so paid to the feeding of Indian units was a new departure,
as until then it had been the general custom to leave Indians to cater for
themselves without interference from their officers.
As a result, that part of
the troops in this theatre which was Indian, amounting to 70 per cent., had
often been disregarded from the catering standpoint.
