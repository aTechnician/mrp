Normally they would maintain the stocks of C.S.Ds., and,

They were located, so as to have easy rail access to each other and to areas

These depots were selected, partially stocked, and staffed, within three

Deptford handled a total of 2,000 tons
a day, and Barry 4,000, at the peak period.
M.S.Ds. then held about five
days' rations for the total feeding strength of the United Kingdom.
Some readiustments in their locations became necessary in 1941.
Reigate site was unsuitable, and new M.S.Ds. were necessary in Southern
and South-Eastern Commands for the proper distribution of the reserves.
They were consequently placed at Ascot, Westerham (Kent), and Shepton
Mallet (Somerset).
Control of M.S.Ds.
At the same time, it was decided to decentralize the administrative
control of M.S.Ds. to commands.
Central control of issue, replacement, and
accounting, was to be retained by D.D.S.(P), because reserves in the M.S.Ds.
formed part of the total reserve of foodstuffs for the troops in the United
Kingdom, and the dispersion of such reserves could not, for accommodation
reasons, be related to the fighting strength of commands.

Home Guard Feeding Arrangements
The feeding of the Home Guard was not at any time a primary military,
i.e., R.A.S.C., responsibility, and the position of the D.S.T. in this respect
was therefore that of adviser and helper.
When this force was first raised
Volunteers in June, 1940, it was the intention that
they should normally
be employed without administrative service troops.
The general arrangement was therefore that they were to be fed from civil
resources unless they
were actually absorbed into the Army.
elementary instructions were developed to deal with contingencies as they
arose, chiefly by local improvisation.
Provision was, however, made of
Army stocks of food as reserves for detachments which might be employed
The following quantities of supplies for each isolated
section of the L.D.V. were authorized, to be drawn from the nearest C.S.D.,
and located at a suitable police station: one case of preserved meat (48-lb.),
cases of biscuits (100 lb.), two tins of tea (4 ib.), two tins of sugar
(14 lb.), three tins of cheese (6 lb.), seven tins of jam (14 lb.), and seven
tins of condensed milk.
This was estimated to cover about three days'
supplies for the section.
