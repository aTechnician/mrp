a framework of the divisional R.A.S.C. companies in order to control and

The proposal was made that the vehicles of the M.T.
vehicle depots
should be at the disposal of the C.-in-C., Home Forces; but S.T.3 represented
that the number and type of vehicles in these depots fluctuated from time to
time, and it would be dangerous to plan on their availability.
The use of vehicles of transport units in Mobilization Centres, R.A.S.C.,
and other R.A.S.C. units mobilized for overseas, for troop-carrying duties
in case of an emergency only was, however, agreed, unrestricted use being
permitted if active operations developed.
In any case, the sub-unit organi-
zation of companies so employed was to be kept intact.
The eleven divisions and the Armoured Division which returned from
France brought no R.A.S.C. vehicles with

Motor Coach Companies
On 18th June, it was decided to acquire over
1,900 motor coaches,
to be formed into Motor Coach Companies, R.A.S.C., for the conveyance
of troops of divisions.
This meant the creation of a procedure to acquire vehicles under Ministry
of Defence Regulations, which had not hitherto been used by the War Depart-
ment, and required detailed collaboration with the Ministry of Transport
and the Treasury Solicitor.
Meantime, 60 technically qualified R.A.S.C.
officers, including those of the Inspectorate of Supplementary
Transport,
began the initial selection and earmarking of the vehicles to be acquired.
The War Establishment of a Motor Coach Company was drawn up. and
redundant R.A.S.C. units, formerly in the B.E.F., were reorganized to form
the 32 companies necessary.
Coaches were absorbed into organized com-
panies at an average rate of about 240 vehicles, i.e., four companies, a day.
