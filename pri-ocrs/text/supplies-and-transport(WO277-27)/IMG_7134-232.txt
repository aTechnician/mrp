THE SUPPLY ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE LOAD
In considering the ratio of the load to the number of supply personnel
employed in maintaining
troops in the
United Kingdom
at different
stages during the war, it is dificult to give any true picture, but the following
comparative table gives some idea: —
Supply Personnel
United Kingdom
Date
authorized
Ration Strength
July, 1943
12,000
2,850,000
May, 1944
10,500
3,050,000
January, 1945
10,500
2,430,000
June,
1945
9,900
2,430,000
At the last date, June, 1945, the supply units and installations in the
United Kingdom were as follows: -
Chief Provision Officer (Food Supplies).
Supply and Petrol Depot Inspectorate.
Seven Supply Reserve Depots, Type
"A".
One Supply Reserve Depot, Type " B".
Ten Main Supply Depots.
Three Static Machine Bakeries (A.T.S.).
Six W.D. Bakeries.
21 Mobile Field Bakeries.
16 Port Detachments.
Six R.A.S.C. Port Services (Home).
150 (approximately) Command Supply Depots.
It must be noted that the United Kingdom ration strength is not a true
index of the load on S.R.Ds., since the latter dealt also with overseas com-
mitments;
and their activities, and those of R.A.S.C. services at ports, in
connection with the maintenance of 21 Army Group, from, say, January,
1944, must also be borne in mind.
It has also to be remembered that the load on C.S.Ds. before the invasion
of Europe in June, 1944, was lightened to some extent by the fact that field
of much detailed work in making issues.
formations drew in bulk from these depots, which were therefore relieved
The departure of these formations
did not, therefore, make a wholly proportionate reduction in the load,
would no doubt largely account for the number of supply personnel being
the same at May, 1944, and January, 1945.
