CHAPTER X
INDIA BASE AND CEYLON
SECTION 1.-INDIA BASE
The supply and transport services of the Indian Army were entirely
independent of those of the British Army, and were operated under their
own directorate at G.H.Q., India, by the Royal Indian Army Service Corps.
The R.I.A.S.C., as the Supply and Transport Corps, had co-operated with
the Army Service Corps in various theatres in the war of 1914-1918.
for six or seven years after that war, operated the mechanical
transport of the Indian Army; and there was a possibility
of the two corps being amalgamated, or at least of a system of co-operation
which existed in
Royal Signals, and Royal Army Medical Corps, with their Indian
Army counterparts,
However, for a
reasons, this was not achieved, although a considerable number of R.A.S.C.
who were serving
units in India,
transferred to the
R.I.A.S.C. when that corps assumed full control of all Indian Army M.T.
Thereafter, separation
was more complete than it had been before.
far from being interchangeable,
necessary for them to serve together again in
the war of 1939-1945.
Apart from different systems of accounting, differences in procedure, and
questions of language,
there were differences in organization and method
which made things more difficult when the two corps came to work together,
whether as units or individuals.
As the war went on, however, and the two corps were jointly engaged
in various theatres of war, the R.I.A.S.C. conformed to an increasing extent
organization and practice.
It is not within the scope of this
work to give a detailed account of the organization and
the R.I.A.S.C. during the war; but a brief account is included of some of the
more noticeable features of, and developments in, the Indian supply and
transport organization, both for purposes of comparison, and as a back-
ground to other chapters.
S. and T. Organization in India
The S.T. Directorate in India was responsible for services similar to
those administered by the R.A.S.C.
elsewhere,
but excluding the repair of
M.T. vehicles,
barrack services, and the provision of clerks for formation
headquarters offices.
After the R.I.A.S.C. took over its own M.T. from the
R.A.S.C., it
was responsible for the maintenance and repair of all M.T. in India until
those functions were transferred to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps, to-
gether with practically all technical M.T. personnel, in April, 1939.
