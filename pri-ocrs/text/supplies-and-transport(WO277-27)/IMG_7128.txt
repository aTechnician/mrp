APPRECIATION BY THE CHIEF PROVISION OFFICER (FOOD
SUPPLIES) AS TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE SUPPLY DEPOT
ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM TO CARRY THE
LOAD INVOLVED IN THE MAINTENANCE OF 21 ARMY GROUP
ON THE CONTINENT
The calculations contained in the appreciation were based on two peak
figures: e.g., 300,000 for the first 42 days, and 900,000 thereafter.
In each
case, the figure covered all smaller strengths.
The following is a summary of the factors and arguments adduced:
1. Part 1 of the appreciation contained depot statistics of holdings,
truck and tonnage capacity, and labour.
These showed that 6,000 tons
net a day could be handled.
If the S.R.Ds. and certain M.S.Ds. (i.e.,
those holding Compo rations) were worked together, then 7,000 tons net
could be handled daily till the M.S.Ds.
were empty of their Compo
holdings, i.e., 210,000 tons monthly.
Part 2 of the appreciation showed that the tonnage involved in
respect of 300,000 for the first 42 days, including reserves, amounted
to 67,000 tons, which could be moved in ten days.
Part 3 showed the tonnage involved for normal maintenance for
There was an output and intake commitment of 110,000 tons a
month (30 days); this was covered by the handling capacity of 180,000
Taking other military commitments into account, the total commit-
ment was 120,000 tons, which was still within capacity.
Since the strength of 900,000 would not in fact be reached for some

additional tonnage required for the build-up of G.S.

Part 4 showed the peak output and intake tonnages handled by supply
depots in connection with the launching of the North African operation.
In January, 1943, supply depots handled 137,000 tons.
Compared
with this, there was an anticipated tonnage commitment by Ist April.
1944, of 180,000 tons.
With the completion of authorized depot extensions, and operation of
the new SP Dot Dorry, it was reasonable to say that the maintenanc
of " Overlord" could be effected.
Figures were produced showing that
certain southern depots could deal exclusively with the initial 42 days

2. In considering the capacity available for allocation to Civil Affairs
foodstuffs, the problem was related by C.P.O. (Foodstuffs) to the initial
42 days of the operation, and then to continued maintenance: â€”
(a) First 30 days, covering D Day to D + 42.
Part 1 showed the estimated maximum monthly capacity to be
210,000 tons.
Against this, there was a definite " Overlord" com-
mitment of 56,000 tons (Part 2), leaving an apparent surplus of
154,000 tons.
While the Compo and reserves supplied during the initial 42
days had not to be replaced, as they were provided from stocks
built up for the express purpose of launching " Overlord", never-
theless supply depots would still be working on their normal intake
from manufacturers and the Ministry of Food.
Ihis intake was
assessed at 40,000 tons.
Issues of special packs (Arctic, 24-hour ration, and A.F.V.),
would also be in progress; but it was assumed that all the Arctic,
and 50 per cent. of the others, would have been cleared in the
first 30 days, the tonnage involved being, say, 11,000 tons.
Excluding the Mediterranean, which was maintained direct from

commitments
in respect of

garrisons based on the United Kingdom were assessed at 1,000
tons a month.
10,000 tons a month were earmarked to provide a reserve
capacity against conditions resulting from intensive enemy air
attack, and the possible partial failure of North American supplies
to the Mediterranean area.
The monthly tonnage left available for consideration in con-
nection with Civil Affairs foodstuffs was, therefore, as in the follow-
ing summary: -
