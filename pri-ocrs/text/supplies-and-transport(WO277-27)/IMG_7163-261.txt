43. Composite (14-men) Ration Pack
The Composite (or Compo) (14-men) pack was produced for feeding troops
for periods not exceeding six weeks, during the initial stages of an operation
and immediately following the consumption of the 24-hour ration, which was
normally in issue for the first two days.
It was made up entirely of tinned commodities, with variations to allow for
daily change of diet throughout the week.
It was intended that cooking
facilities under unit arrangements would be available when the Compo pack
ration was in issue, but for isolated detachments improvised cooking arrange-
ments would be necessary.
There were two categories of Compo pack; one with biscuit, and comprising
seven varieties identified as Types
"A" to
"G"; and one without biscuit,
for issue when fresh bread was available, and comprising three varieties, desig-
nated Types 1, 2 and 3.
Solid fuel cookers were not included in the pack, and
were not intended to be issued separately unless circumstances were exceptional.
The packing of the ration required a very large tinplate allotment.
It was,
therefore, essential to economize in its use, by issuing the normal Field Service
Ration Scale as early as practicable.
The Compo pack was not designed for
long-term feeding.
The composition of the Composite (14 men) Ration Pack, of both categories,
was as follows :—
