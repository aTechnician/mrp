The Ministry agreed to accept all responsibility for the arrangements in
connection with hirings except the payment of bills, which must remain a
W.D. responsibility.
Commands were required to terminate contracts with civilian vehicle

were not available, although drivers were not normally employed for more
than ten hours a day.
For this practice was substituted the payment of drivers
at statutory rates, with the addition of subsistence allowance when necessary.

Arrangements were made in War Office-controlled depots to obtain loads,
military or civil, for vehicles being delivered to units or to ports, from

Units of all arms were directed to notify the local R.A.S.C. officer i/c
transport of particulars of vehicles employed on all standing details, and of
their destinations, and other duty journeys where sufficient notice could be
given to arrange return loads.
The O. i/c transport would then either
arrange Army loads, or, in conjunction with the M.T.L.O, civil loads, on
that part of the journey which would otherwise have been performed without
a load. In arranging loads, the O. i/c transport also consulted the District
