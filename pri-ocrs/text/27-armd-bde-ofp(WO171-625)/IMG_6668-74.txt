Summary of Events and Information
Started preparation of Non sealed cards i.e.
when cemands are received for
items of Tools and Equipt for which we have no stock and none on demand,
Cards are prepared for these items. These account cords
are mathtained
separately and apart from normal account cards. Every time an Item is
demanded for which one of these cards exists on entry is made. If there is
no card one is prepared. These cards nre submitted to 0.C. three times a
week for review. Where the number of demands wrrents it ,provision action
is taken and the card is put into the Visidex cabinet in use in the
appropriate group.
Clerks cannot cope with the job of controlling and registering all demands
which amount to an average if 1500 itens a day. Have therefore stopped this.
It is only really necessary when operating a " To Follows " system when it is
essentirl that a record is mintained of outstanding demands from Units.
