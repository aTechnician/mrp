Commanding Officer Major M.F. Barmardo
References to gendice:
27 Armd Bae W/Shops with 256 Army Del Sqn are
deminding Wireless Sets,
Veh Spares and Telescopes direct from this H.Q.
In this way there is no
check on
whether or not the items were actually with the Tank when It
passed into the Aruy Dely Sen circuit. Have instructed W/Shops to submit all
demands through our detachmt with 256 Ary Del Sqn who will first check
that the items were
in fact deficient.
30.
Stores are being issued from Home Depots in part only and vouchers show
that no "To Follows" are being created. Requested DADOS A.R.G. that this
matter be brought up and if possible, amended. Answer was that War Office
SAys no "To Follow' system is in force. This seems to be all wrong as stores
are urgently required and means that we must continually re-indent for the
Same stores when further part vouchers could be created at Home Depots and
held pending receipt of stores from Trade.
Stock of 17 Par (Amerion) Striker Gases is becoming dengerously low and no
receipts in response to demands are coming in. Requested DADOS to hasten
