(o) Deductions
(1)
BRIONNE as june pt of up and down routes with bus is oasy to attack
fron the surrounding wooded
country and will, require a strong
permanent garrison.
I consider this town the most vital pt on the
route.
(ii)
FONTANE is of lesser importance but is easy to attack and will
require a permanent garrison.
(111) BOISNHY is the centre of my seator with good ras radiating in both
directions and is suitable for the mob res.
