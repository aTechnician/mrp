This resulted in abnormal urgent demands on

The activities described in this Section were carried out with a strength
of approximately 58 officers (including 12 South African) and 270 British
N.C.Os. (including 180 South African).
There were, in addition, 580

Transition Period and Re-organization, 1942
The end of the Abyssinian campaign found the E.A.A.O.C. responsible
for maintaining two divisions of East and West African troops, as well
as a number of South Africans employed in the
services: the South
Africans were withdrawn towards the end of 1941.
Early in 1942, East Africa became an independent Command; conditions
became static and Ordnance representatives were attached to the various
area and sub-area headquarters formed.
The entry of Japan into the war had little effect on East Africa until
the decision was made to use East African troops in Burma, and to
develop East Africa Command as a Base.
This led to the formation of
the 11th (E.A.) Division Ordnance Field Park, ordnance sections, R.E.M.E.
divisional and brigade staffs, the training and supplying of reinforcements
to the Division when it went to Burma, and the arrival of more stores than
the B.O.D. had been designed to hold.
Extensions could not be put up
quickly owing to the scarcity of building materials, and stores were therefore
accommodated in shacks built of wood and tarpaulins.
These gave satis-
factory protection, but were not by any means ideal for stock-taking or
By July, 1942, the personnel situation had improved sufficiently to
permit a general re-organization of storage and accounting arrangements.
Within a few months, the formation of the East African Corps of Electrical
and Mechanical Engineers (E.A.E.M.E.) relieved E.A.A.O.C. Of its workshop
responsibilities.
At the same time the E.A.A.O.C. took over from the East
African Army Service Corps (E.A.A.S.C.) the responsibility of providing
and supplying "B" vehicles and M.T. spares; this necessitated absorbing
the existing vehicle parks.
During this period a paint factory was established which produces
all the camouflage paint required in the Command.
A civilian clothing
factory was taken over and produced one third of Command requirements
of blankets and cellular cloth for underclothing.
