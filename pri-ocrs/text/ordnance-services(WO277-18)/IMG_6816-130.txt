During this time instructions to units on the action to be taken by them
during concentration, marshalling, embarkation and disembarkation were
published in 21 Army Group Preparation Orders.
These dealt with such
matters as the disposal of unaccompanied war equipment, the obtaining of
"A" and "B" vehicle waterproofing kits, de-waterproofing, and the method
of effecting last-minute replacements.
Among many points concerning Ordnance Services for the Force during
the mounting period which had to be settled were: -
(a) The number of blankets which men should carry on embarkation,
how they should obtain them and where they should leave any that
were surplus.
(b) The method of obtaining last-minute
replacements while in con-
centration and marshalling areas and up to what
embarkation replacement should be permitted.
stage before
(e) The return of inflatable lifebelts, provision for which had not been
made in sufficient quantity to provide one for each man.
ments had to be made for them to be sent back in returning craft,
inspected and serviced in the United Kingdom and sent to the
marshalling areas for re-issue.
A crisis occurred later because these
lifebelts, which made excellent pilliss, were not returned in suf-
ficient quantities.
(d) The scale of reserves of waterproofing material to be held in con-
centration and marshalling areas.
