Command.
An account of ordnance services in the Sicilian and Italian Theatres is
given separately in Chapter XIII.
Development of Base Installations
At this point in the narrative it is instructive to look back and trace how
the ordnance base installations in the Middle East were initially planned and
progressively developed into the vast, flexible organizations needed for war.
The relevant local factors and peculiarities of the theatre which required
consideration in planning these installations are given earlier in this Chapter.
It was decided in 1940 that three B.O.Ds. and three B.A.Ds. would be
needed, that immediate requirements should be met by the reorganization of
the existing command ordnance depot and the long term requirement by the
establishment of new depots.
As regards locations it was decided that no
base ordnance installation should be sited west of the River Nile a decision
which appeared to be justified when the enemy advanced as far as
Alamein in 1942.
Base Ordnance Depots
From the existing command depot No. 4 B.O.D. was formed.

Initially No. 4 B.O.D. was stocked with a full range of the ordnance
stores applicable to the theatre.

of the B.O.D.
Later, when American types of vehicles came into the country

and searchlights mounted on 15-cwt. trucks, were organized and supplemented
by hidden watchers, armed with tommy guns and rifles, to deal with them.
These measures were effective and the organized gangs gave place to thieving
by individuals operating singly, especially at night.
This activity was countered by detailing four armed men to each store
shed for night guard duty and by armed patrols with trained dogs.

The depot employed a man-power force
