A task which proved formidable and dangerous was the removal of
ammunition from A.F.Vs. backloaded.

been removed from these vehicles before they were backloaded, but as many
came back direct from the battlefield, this was not always done.

THE AMMUNITION ORGANIZATION
The ammunition units available to 21 Army Group to maintain the two
armies in the field were: â€”
(a) Four base ammunition depots (Nos. 2, 3, 15 and 17).
(b) Four independent ordnance ammunition
(c) Eight ordnance beach detachments (subsequently reduced to two).
(d) Fourteen port ammunition detachments.
(e) Twenty-one forward maintenance ammunition sections (plus four
(f) One field ammunition repair factory.
(g) Seven mobile ammunition repair units (plus two Canadian).
(h) Six ammunition rail/ roadheads (plus three Canadian).
There were also two additional B.A.Ds. (Nos. 1 and 12) operating as such
in the theatre for a short time, but these were re-formed into three enemy
ammunition depot control units.
Early in April, 1944, 21 Army Group obtained from the War Office a list
of all kinds of ammunition which would be available.
This information was
passed to Second Army who, it had been agreed, were to plan the require-
ments for the initial phase of the operation.
In agreement with Second
Army and War Office, a complete detail of the ammunition to be supplied
for the first 30 days was drawn up and distributed to those concerned.
This
detail was broken down not only into quantities to be supplied by days, but
to which of three beaches and in which particular vessel the ammunition was
to be sent.
In addition to the estimated maintenance, the planned shipment included
quantities for the build-up of agreed reserves.
Extra holdings were allocated
to formations large and small over and above their first and second line
holdings.
On the morning
of D-Day 8 O.B.Ds. and 3 ammunition companies
followed the assault divisions and within a few hours had established dumps
on the beaches and in gardens along the promenades in spite of constant
enemy shell fire, sniper fire and bombing.
Clerks worked incessantly on
stock records in order that the Staffs of formations should be kept fully
informed of the up-to-date ammunition position.
This was of vital import-
ance. as the
ammunition intake was not on such a
scale as to allow
unrestricted expenditure.
A loss of 400 tons of ammunition through enemy
bombing created a difficult situation for a time.
Nos. 11 and 12 O.B.Ds. and 44 Ordnance Ammunition Company operated
dumps in the 101 Beach Sub-Area, Nos. 9, 14 and 15 O.B.Ds.
dnance Ammunition Company operated in 102 Beach Sub-Area, al
os. 7, 10 and 36 O.B.Ds. and 43 Ordnance Ammunition Company operat
During the early days of the campaign, dumps were
under the direct control of Corps H.Q., 1 Corps being responsible for 101 and
102 Beach Sub-Areas and 30 Corps for 104 Beach Sub-Area.
From D-Day onwards, the plans laid for the arrival of ammunition
worked smoothly
and the intake was maintained except for some delays
during rough weather. During the early days, the few units ashore handled
a larger tonnage of ammunition than had ever before been moved through
beaches.
Slight adjustments in the types loaded were made at short notice
to cover the differences which arose between the estimated and actual expendi-
Thre
For instance, it had been anticipated that before the end of June
two million rounds of 75-mm. tank ammunition would have been expended
but the expenditure was negligible, and a major storage problem was caused
which lasted until large quantities were expended by the Canadian Army in
the last battles of the campaign.
The first B.A.D. (No. 17) arrived in Normandy on 11th June and super-
imposed its organization over that of the O.B.Ds.
With the advent of No. 17
B.A.D. it was possible to plan ammunition dumps on a bigger scale inland.
On 18th June No. 15 B.A.D. arrived and took over ammunition dumps
in 104 Beach Sub-Area.
