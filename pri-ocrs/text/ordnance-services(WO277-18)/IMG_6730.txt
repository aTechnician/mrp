and an ammunition maintenance company or alternatively that the split should
have been made laterally into corps maintenance companies and army main-
tenance companies.
The mobile stores repair unit (M.S.R.U.) was devised to undertake " stitch
in time" repairs in the army area, in order to save
the return of large
quantities of textile stores, boots, etc. to the base at a time when the Eighth
Army was operating many hundreds of miles from the base.
As the labour
for the boot repairs, textile and carpenters shops was found from local civilian
resources, the moves of this repair unit were naturally restricted.
At an early stage in this campaign it was decided to divorce the vehicle
company from the base and advanced ordnance depots ane to treat it as a

The organization of R.A.O.C. stores convoy units introduced for the
lesten Desert campaigns remained unaltered, and actual experience proved
onclusively that without this means of rapid road and air supply of vital
ores, efficient maintenance of the fighting troops would have been impossible.
le normal rail or sea communications were too unreliable and the delay in
nsit was too great to enable the sudden and urgent needs of the armies to
met by the usual channels.
The two standard A.O.Ds. used during this campaign were organized on
principles of an advanced component of a B.O.D.

le two main lessons learned from the installation and operation of

ly aggravated the fault.
This experience again indicated that in
modern warfare it is desirable to provide in the maintenance project, for
the construction by works services of a rail-served ordnance depot, to a
predetermined design, composed of easily erected shedding.
Taking the second point, although only 18 vehicles were authorized in

No provision
was made in the war establishment for the staff required to control and
maintain the large fleet of vehicles, and the problem was solved by the
formation of two " depot transport control units R.A.S.C." which were placed
under the orders of the C.O.O. of the depot.
The North-West Europe Campaign June, 1944-May, 1945
The projected invasion of Normandy presented, for the first time, the
opportunity for a long period of planned preparation and mobilization of
the R.A.O.C. field units allotted to the force.
It was, therefore, possible to
take stock of the organization in use in North Africa and Italy and to
prepare and train meticulously the units which would be required in the
order of battle of the invasion force.
At the War Office the D.G.A.E. had been redesignated Deputy Quarter-
Master General (Army Equipment) (D.Q.M.G. (A.E.)), the appointment of
Controller of Ordnance Services (C.O.S.) had been re-introduced and the
responsibility for R.A.O.C. field organization and procedure had reverted
to the C.O.S. In March, 1943, a new ordnance branch at the War Office
(Ord.
1) was created under a Deputy Controller of Ordnance Services
(D.C.O.S.) (Brigadier C. Cansdale), to deal with all questions relating to
R.A.O.C field force organization and procedure, and in conjunction with
the Staff, the formation, training and mobilization of R.A.O.C. field units.
This was an important organizational change since, in the past, the C.O.S.
had never been provided with an adequate staff to deal with the field force
aspect of ordnance services.
In addition, an R.A.O.C. standing committee
(field force organization) under the chairmanship of Major-General W. W.
Richards was set up to consider all aspects of field force organization and
planning.
In the initial stages of the planning, which began early in 1943, it
became obvious that this operation would have peculiarities which would
necessitate alterations in the existing field force organization, and certain
basic principles were laid down to ensure that all Services would plan on
uniform lines.
These principles were as follows: â€”
(a) That the operation would involve only a short sea voyage up to
a maximum of 120 miles; that the main base for this operation
would be in the United Kingdom and that the main base installa-
tions would have to share the load of daily maintenance for the
force.
(b) That initially, and for some indeterminable period, maintenance over-
seas would have to be from beach maintenance areas.
