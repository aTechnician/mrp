Eventually, a complete organization was developed on the following
lines: -
Washington Headquarters
Ordnance Headquarters Branch controlled all B.A.S. Ordnance
functions in North America and was located at Washington, facilitating
liaison with Headquarters of the various U,S. Army Supply Corps,
and close collaboration with other British Missions and B.A.S. branches.
The branch was organized into sections corresponding to the ordnance
provision branches at War Office.
The division of responsibility was
determined by the necessity for liaison not only with the relative
War Office branch but also with the various U.S. Army Supply
Corps Staffs.
A Headquarters Technical Publication branch
was included,
responsible not only for the provision and distribution to overseas
theatres of technical
publications of U.S. and Canadian production,
but also for the distribution of British publications to British Missions
and B.A.S. branches in North America.
Ottawa Sub-branch
The Ottawa office, was created to work with the Department of
Munitions & Supply (D.M. & S.) and Master General of Ordnance
(M.G.O.) in Canada and thus by liaison to deal with the export
of Canadian production of Ordnance stores for the British Army.
Montreal Office
The Montreal office, responsible for liaison concerning the supply
of Canadian-produced ammunition,
was subsequently opened when
the ammunition control section of D.M. & S. moved from Ottawa
to Montreal.
Detroit Office
The Detroit office, primarily responsible for the provision of "A"
and "B" vehicle spares, was opened when the U.S. Ordnance Corps
transferred the control of these stores from the office of the Chief
of Ordnance in Washington to a sub-office in Detroit.
An M.T.
Technical Section was subsequently organized in conjunction with
the Detroit Provision Office.
Philadelphia Office
The Philadelphia office of the B.A.S. Ordnance Branch was
opened to control the export of ammunition ex U.S.A., when the
corresponding division of
the U.S.
Ordnance Corps moved from
Washington to a sub-office in Philadelphia.
An Engineer & Signals
E. & S.) Technical Section was also organized in
Philadelphia to
facilitate liaison with the equivalent section of the U.S. Signal Corps.
New York Office
The New York office was organized to facilitate liaison with
the headquarters of the shipping agencies.
Ordnance Liaison Officers
on the staff of the New York office were granted direct access to the
