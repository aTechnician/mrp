APPENDIX 5
21 ARMY GROUP ORDNANCE PLAN
(See Chapter XIV, p. 224)
The following is a copy of the Appreciation prepared in May, 1944, by
Brig. J. G. Denniston, the D.O.S.: â€”
" PART I, THE SITUATION EXPECTED ON D+18 APPROX.
1. OBJECT
To describe the situation, as it is expected to be, when the responsibility
for the maintenance of 21 Army Group with Ordnance Stores and ammuni-
tion passes from H.Q. Second Army to H.Q. 21 Army Group (on whose behalf
H.Q. L. of C. takes over responsibility from H.Q. Second Army).
2. GENERAL
The bulk of Second Army, less certain administrative residues, and a
proportion of G.H.Q. and L. of C. Units will be ashore.
First Canadian
Army starts coming ashore D+ 19. On the progress of operations depends
whether or not the Rear Maintenance Area will be available for Ordnance
installations.
If opposition has been stiff, Advanced Ordnance Depot and
Base Ammunition Depots may have to open in the Areas of 2 and 1 L. of C.
Terminals. If the first Advanced Ordnance Depot (17 Advanced Ordnance
Depot) opens in 2 L. of C. Terminal it will have to remain there unless
the flow of 'Beach Maintenance Packs is stopped, owing to the impossibility
of moving an Advanced Ordnance Depot once it is established. The decision
whether 17 Advanced Ordnance Depot is to open in 2 L. of C. Terminal
or Rear Maintenance Area must be taken about D + 6.
The Build up of administrative units may also be affected by the rate
of progress of the forward troops.
3. DIVISIONAL ORDNANCE FIELD PARKS AND SUB-PARKS
Portions ashore shown at Annexure I.

Vehicle Park and certain residues will be established either
