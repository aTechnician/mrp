Moved fron FATAISE to BRAY (near BEAUMONT-LE-ROGER), a distance of

Special convoys were sent to No.1 Ord. Maintenance Coy. at No.4 Army
Roadhead, nr. LAIGID, to remove a quantity of stores which had accumulated
there for 12 Corps Troops. Owing to severe restriction on transport lift.
for future moves, it was not possible to take more than approximately.
one-third of the total there. Difficulty is experienced in getting units
which are advancing to come back for stores, and this entails carrying
those forward ourselves, and increasing our load.
