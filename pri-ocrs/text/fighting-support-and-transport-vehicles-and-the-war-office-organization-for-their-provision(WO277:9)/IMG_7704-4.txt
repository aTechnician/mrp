FOREWORD
This book is one of a series of volumes, compiled by authority of the
Army Council, the object of which is to preserve the experience
gained during the Second World War, 1939-1945, in selected fields
of military staff work and administration.
The authors have been
given access to official sources of information, and every endeavour
has been made to ensure the accuracy of the work as a historical
record.
Any views expressed and conclusions drawn are those of
the authors, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Army Council,
which, so far as they relate to current training, are to be found in
the official manuals, training memoranda, etc., issued from time to
time by the War Office.
For the operational background the reader is referred to the
Official History of the War.
