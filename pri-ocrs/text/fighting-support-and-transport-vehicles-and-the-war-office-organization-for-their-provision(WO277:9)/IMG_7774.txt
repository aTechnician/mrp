4. Production for the Equipment of the Post-war Army in Peace.—Probably
75 per cent. of the existing production facilities of the Industry
unsuitable for the production of the heavy classes of military vehicles.
The annual quantities of all types likely to be required would not be
sufficient to induce the mass-production side of the Industry to sacrifice any
part of their commercial business by altering existing production facilities.
The development of a few prototype vehicles in small engineering establishments
would contribute little to the final and urgent problem of large production.
Special arrangements will therefore have to be made at Government expense
if the War Office is to obtain these vehicles in peace, with the certainty of
immediate and vast increase of production in emergency.
idealistic.
units in order to expand mechanization at a sufficient rate on the outbreak of war.
If the Government reduced the taxation on the heavier types of commercial
vehicles and larger types of car, if the existing restriction on weights, dimensions,
etc., of these vehicles were relaxed, and if a comprehensive policy of road
improvement were adopted, the Industry would be encouraged to produce
types of commercial vehicles which would be reasonably suitable, if not ideal,
for a considerable proportion of the Army's requirements.
The adoption of these suggestions would materially decrease the cost of the
measures required to be taken in peace to equip the Army with suitable vehicles
in war.
Even if these suggestions are adopted, the Industry cannot cope with the
war potential with its existing facilities.
The following measures will therefore
be necessary in peace :—
(i) For the smaller classes of vehicles, provide the necessary balancing
plant to equip such existing factories as can be adapted to produce
them.
(ii) For the larger classes, provide shadow factories.
(i) Place sufficient orders to assure rapid expansion in an emergency.
6. Use of Government-owned Establishments. —The Panel do not recommend
the employment of establishments on the lines of the Royal Arsenal or Dock-
yards in the design, development and production of special military vehicles
for the following reasons :-
(i) The difficulty of ensuring that the design staff keep up-to-date with
commercial design and development technique.
(ii) The difficulty of ensuring that the designs and prototypes are suitable
for mass production under modern production systems.

APPENDIX C
SUMMARY OF REPORT OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON THE
POST-WAR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF
"B" VEHICLES.
10TH JULY, 1945
Terms of Reference
(i) To consider the report of the Industrial Advisory Panel and to make
any recommendations thereon.
(ii) To consider whether a more permanent committee on "B" vehicles
should be set up, and if so, on what basis.
Recommendations
1. The centralization of responsibility for vehicles for all three Services
should be continued into the future.
2. That we endorse the recommendations of the T.O.T.A.C. report, so far
as they bear upon the military personnel employed on design and development
of Military vehicles; and the similar observations of the Industrial Panel.
3. (a) That responsibilities in the Supply Department for fighting and
non-fighting vehicles should be amalgamated in one division.
(b) That components generally have so little in common that amalgamation
at low levels is not recommended.
