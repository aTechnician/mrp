Much the same was true in the 1939 45 war, but the contrast was more
as by this time the U.S. automobile industry was infinitely larger than
Great Britain.
In addition to, or perhaps on account of, her vast
productive capacity in this industry, the U.S. possessed great resources in highly
skilled designers, draughtsmen and production engineers, who were not cramped
by restrictions of weight, horsepower and high cost of petrol.
States had thus been able to build an export trade throughout the world, which
provided unrivalled opportunities for studying performance in, and
creating designs for, all kinds of conditions.

application of this principle to automobile production was an established fact
long before the 1939-45 war.
The products of this standardization were the
result not only of large capital expenditure but also of years of experience and
study of the requirements of the user. In this country, with its negligible
gradients and comparatively short journeys, these requirements were com-
paratively modest. An assessment of the type of vehicle appropriate for such
conditions was therefore not a difficult matter because the conditions to be
fulfilled were permanently and almost tangibly before the designer's eye.
practice, however, restrictive legislation made it difficult to meet even this
requirement.
Imagination was necessary in the design of the military vehicle, whose
functions and conditions of operation were outside practical experience.
was easier therefore to assume that what was suitable for commerce would be
suitable for war, and if this assumption had been correct, the problem of
equipment of the Army would have been greatly reduced. Unfortunately the
assumption was not correct, and merely the result of loose and wishful thinking.
Fortunately for this country, on the other hand, American production was
designed even before 1939 to meet conditions far more akin to those of war.
The road towards standardization of military vehicles was not made easier
by the demands of the Services themselves.
The preceding chapter has
endeavoured to show that in peace-time the system of gradual mechanization of
the Army, arm by arm, tended to production of vehicles admirable for a
specific purpose, but not of a basic design suitable for the Army as a whole.
This very natural tendency persisted throughout the war, in spite of the work of
co-ordination of requirements which formed part of the duties of D.S.W.V.
As late as September, 1944, there were some 55 different types of " B" vehicles
within the Infantry division and some 600 different types, makes and contracts
within the Army as a whole,' and requirements ranged from air-portable trucks
to mobile pigeon lofts and bacteriological laboratories.
multiplicity upon the system of spares and vehicle tools provision can best be
left to the imagination.
When it is realized that the war produced very few
"freak" vehicles such as the amphibian, and that this variety of types and
makes was composed essentially of ordinary load carrying chassis with
specialized bodies of one kind and another, the situation can be seen to be quite
fantastic and so patently impracticable that it is necessary to dig deep for basic
Although the Army cannot be absolved from blame for adding to the
confusion, the inherent trouble is not so simple and must be found among the
complexities of business rivalries and personal feelings, odd though this may
appear during a war to the death. A very good example of the various obstacles
to standardization is afforded by the motor-cycle industry.
The following facts give some necessary background. There were six
manufacturers of army motor-cycles, each producing a separate model.
Each
factory varied in the extent to which it constructed the complete motor-cycle,
but in general, electrical equipment, carburettors, handle-bar controls and
similar components were obtained in a finished condition from specialist firms.
Some manufacturers also obtained gear-boxes in the same way.
Apart from
such equipment as was obtained complete, but including the gear-box, a
