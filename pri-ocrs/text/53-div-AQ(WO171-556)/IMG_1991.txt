Summary of Events and Information
Commanding Officer:
Div proved to
be a sound step; units may make even better use of it. If
any particular circuits are required in Bde areas in ANTWERP, Div HQ must be
asked to organise them. BIS now open at 893495. Two weeks sups to be
drawn on 11 Sep. Div Cemetery est at 724930.
158 Bde would like evad
tps (9.8. those under sentence for Fa punisiment, comp leave, eto) to be
simplified; baes cannot spare
tpt for this purpose. Matter to be taken up
with 12 Corps. Civil Affairs say hot baths available for men in ANTWERP at
rate of 100 per hr. (This later proved to be impracticable owing to shortage
of fuel). Fly-proof wire netting carried by Ri to be disposed of, as no
longer required. 12 Corps hope to obtain a hotel in BRUSSMS (staffed by
civilians) at which offrs may spend their 48 hrs leave. Amy food to be
provided, but no charge to be made. This scheme a gift to the British Forces
from the BELGIAN Goverrment.
Div Cas: 1 OR killed; 1 OR wounded; 6 ORs missing;
All ranks start to nake best use of their time in and
2 ORs rejoined.
