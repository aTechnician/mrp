ADMINISTRATIVE STAFE
Cases have been reported of looting equipment such as thermos flasks
and binoculars fron British Tanks which have been knocked out.
The result of
his is not only a loss of
equipment which is in short supply, but delay in
putting tanks which are recoverable back into battle owing to lack of kit.
Units will therefor salo stops to ensure
that this practice ceases.
