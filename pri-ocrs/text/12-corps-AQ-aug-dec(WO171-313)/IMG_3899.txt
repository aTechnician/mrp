IMPREST HOLDERS DEALING WITH TWO OR MORE CURRENCIES
The location of a number of Units on the-borders of HOLI,AND and BELGIUM
and BETGIUM and FRANCE is such that they are of necessity required to hold more
than one currency.
Where units are situated on the borders of two countries and therefore
require
to hold more than one currency, Imprest Holders will
indent on separate
AF's
N 1488 for the currencies required.
Separate AF's N 1531
with relevant
vouchers, will be maintained for each currency.
Each AF N 1531 (and the relative vouchers) will bear the same Imprest
Nunber and will,
In fact, constitute the one Imprest Account, the sub
division
being merely for the convenience of the Imprest Holder and Officer IC No 2 Base
Where two ox
compiled, they will be
rendered together AS ONE ACCOUNT to Officer IC No 2 Base Clearing House at the
close of the account period, showing each balance of currency held.
