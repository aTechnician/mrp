Analysis of both G1098's shows approx 600 items affected in changing from
SP fa arty to 25-pdr tractor-drawn.
Officers' Shop takings 25090 fTS - 1 pr boots, ID and 1 valise not accounted
for - this job is obviously difficult to handle with normal ADOS staff - the
amount of money involved makes it a responsibility for the most senior rank.
