Against these various dirficulties is the ifet that once they get the
idea, the civilians (although not as efficient as RASC dvrs) have been found
to work very
well and enthuviastically, and are very happy to carry large
loads on their vehs for short distances.
Org overheads are very
compared with, eg the tpt pl, consisting at the most on any station of one
Subaltern, one Sjt,
one DR, one Clerk, one Fitter, together with escorts drawn
ron the pool for the period of the journeys only.
To sun up, this hired tpt has been found to be a useful addition to
resources but whether or not it is economical or worth while must always be a
relative matter having regard to what WD tpt resources are and also whether
hired
tpt so employed inconveniently diminishes tpt resources required for the
local community.
