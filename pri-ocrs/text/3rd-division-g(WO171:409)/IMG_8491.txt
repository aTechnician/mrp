OBSTACLES
Underwater Obstacles
(1) Stool
Air photographs taken on 21 Feb 44 show that the enemy
hos started to lay hedgehogs below high water mark on
3 Cản Div Beaches opposite COURSEUTLES (971858 - 993856)
and BERNIE IS (995856 - 003856) •
A hedgehog is
composed of
three 6t
6" angle irons joined at the
centre to for a double tripod.
The are placed in
L'CWS
15 feet between hedgehogs and 25 - 30 yards
between rows.
The inner row is about 80 yards
from
the back of the beach;
the outer row about 160 yards.
This is the first instance of an under water obstacle
in the NEPTUNE area.
These obstacles are probably anti-craft rather
than anti-tank in intention.
Those so far laid will
be exposed until about HW - 2 hours.
It is not yet
obstacles will extend.
ndo sable to say how
far these
They have certainly been
erected botween Sop 43 and Feb 4t, and possibly
during the wook prior to 21 Feb,
Considerable development
may therefore have taken placo whon the noxt sortie is
flown.
Rate of erection may be judged from period
20 - 24 Fab whon about 700 yards of coast were covered.
Photos taken on 2, Feb also show 250 yards of
similar obstacle at VILL ERS-SUR-MER 3083 (steel rails and
element '(t) and 1,000
yards at HOULGATE 2380 (steel
These are both
slightly below high water
Line.
(i1) Wire
Very little proparation needed.
Could be rected
at short notice at the rate of say 1,000 yards in three
hours.
• (Note:
Trials carried out by Combined Operctions
xperimental Establishment indicate the hopelessness of
trying to wade waist high
even
through light wire
obstacles, which are out of sight under water.
Wire
thus becomes a serious obstacle when resting in depths
of botween 5 ft and 18 inches.)
(11i) Minos
Vory little preparation needed;
could be laid at
about same tate as wire.
Teller mines could be laid
anywhere within tidal range.
