OL
coast defence and counter-
attack formations in the NHPTUNE area are shown in Appendix i.
Considerable troop movements are
now
taking place in
France, whose full significance is not yet understood.
more accurate forecast
of probable counter-action by mobile
reserve
divisions will be made later.
The present note must
be based on ground rather than known dispositions.

Ground
has been described in I-A.
The most suitable
ares from which a tank attack could be mounted against 1 Corps
seems to be concentration in the area. VIlLERs 015/ and Southwards,
where there
is good cover from air.
Roads move thence either

LISITOX
5288 is a standard station for a panzer division.
10 SS
Pz Div relieved 24 Pz Div there
in Aug 143.
Although locations are NOT confirmed,
10 SS Pz Div
appears to have some troops located a little further
to the WEST and Southwest than dia 24 Pz Div (i.e.
two inf coys in VIMONT 1461;
artillery and possibly
recce troops 10 miles SE of
there),
but this does NOT
consuloure any general move in unis arrector.
The
primary task of the LISIEUX division is presumably
counter attack in the area FAST of R.
ORNE.
If its counter attack role were meant to extend WEST
to URNe, besteux would hardly be central enough for
this purpose.
by :-
Furthermore, movement WEST is restricted
(i)
Saturated area at the mouth of R, DIVES
(ii)
the bottleneck or GAiN.
A wide detour to
the SOUTH over second class roads is
necessary to avoid it.
(iji) R. ORNE.
l'overtheless in point of distance, this division is
nearest to our bridgehead.
Reports during the night D - 1/D day should leave
the enemy in doubt as to whether the convoys constitute
armoured division 1s
still in titsirus at maght not be darected towards tho
still in LISIBUX
NEPTUNE area till the area of allied landings was
confirmed.
no this in to dent say t l oving
alternatives seem to be open to
LISIEUX armoured
VISIOn :-

To move Westwards through CAMN.
If unimpeded the
move might be carried out by H + 5 to 7 hours.
