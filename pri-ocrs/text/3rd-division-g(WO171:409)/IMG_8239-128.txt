Deductions
The ridge HICKLING 0676 must be soized at the first opportunity to cover
the mopping up of the beach arce and of the village WIGORE 1079.

The high ground about NUNITON 1374 must be captured by troops landed
from the soa or air IAST of the valloy of THORNION.
The bridgos at COWVILLiE and STAINLAND are a vital link between formations
operating luSt end WiST of THORNION and special arrangements are theretore
essential for their early capture.
3.
If the ridge FICKLING is used by the leading Brigade as a firm
base and a
second Brigade advances on OPILY, a this a Brigade must land on the first
tide to be prepared to deal with the high ground on the RIGHT
