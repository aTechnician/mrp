Postponenent

If it found necessary to postpone the operation, the following points are
worth noting:
( a.)
It will be extronely important and much nore difficult to effect
complete security.
(b)
Partioular attention will be paid by OC troops of cach craft to
guarding maps.
ENSA parties may be allowed into camp: in this cose they will be
sealed and nove from sealed cump to sealea camp.
BATENING
(a) It is extremely important that as many men as possible should
understand the gendral plan of battle so that they can carry
out their duties
more efficiently and they will work better if they feel they have been taken
into confidence.
(b) It will not be necessary to brief all man with all the details: it
will probably suffice for example to inform drivers:
(i) that they will orbark shortly
(ii)
when they Innd (i.c. 3ra tide D + 1)
(lit)
where they go (i.e. QUEIN BLUE veh parle)
