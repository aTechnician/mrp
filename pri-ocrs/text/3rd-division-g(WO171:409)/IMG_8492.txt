(a) Mine-laying Policy on the Coast
(i)
Since autumn 1942 minelaying in coastal arcas
in France has becn
intensively pushed ahead.
This
is shown by a roport that in Soventh Arny area alone
(R. ORNE - R. LOIRE) about 1,000,000 mines had been
Laza by Uny 1943, of which 750,000 had boon laid in
the preceding six months.
Even at thet time, therofore,
cach coastal divisional sector in the army area
contained some 150, 000 minus, enough for a belt 7 rows
deop along the whole of a 50-mile divisional front.
Since then minelaying has been continued steadily
though naturally it has now become a matter of filling
in gaps here and there.
(ii)
completely
It is not possible to determine accurately or
the
location,
extent and layout of all
minefields in
the NIPTUNE area.
This is particularly
so in the case of mines laid in sand.
But mines are to
be expected at any point or continuously along the
bask of the beach;
at exits; where they best restrict the
routes inland from the coast;
round strongpoints;
in conjunction with the anti-tank ditch.
