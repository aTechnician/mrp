DESCRIPTION OF AREA
1.
The region in which 1 Corps will operate initially lies
in what is known as the "Campagne de CARN"
broad, open
undulating cultivated country dotted with small villages.
This is basically limestone country,
making for good
going off the roads.
In the higher parts geologists report
overlying loams and marls.
These will also offer good going
but would out up badly in wet.

the coast
ORNE
below CAN there is a strip of low-lying mixed sand,
clay and
peat, liable to be soft.
3.
The area between CAN and
the sea is intensely cultivated,
the main crops being sugar beet and colza.
At intervals on the
fields there are lines of trees and occasional hedges,
but
hedges are only a normal feature inmediately SW of
OUISTREAM.

compact, and usually surrounded by orchards.
Orchards outside the villages are less common.

EAST of the River ORNE below CAWN,
low hills overlook
the DIVES vaLLey:
Tree-lined fields, pasture, orchards and
some woods will be found.
5.
SOUTH Of CAEN towards FATAISE 1335 the country changes,
gradue lly from
the open
" campagne"
type already described to
a more hilly region with rugged limestone outcrops.
hill tops there are often beech and oak woods;
on the slopes,
either barren heath or hedged pasture fields.
The northern
part of this country is good for tanks.
6.
WEST of the River ORNE between CAN and VILL ERS
8757
the country tends more
to the typical Normandy
"bocage"
small hedged or tree-lined pasture fields.
Hedges are often
several feet high, and ditched on both sides or growing on
earth banks.
They give cover:
but check cross-country
movement.
But for about 10 miles to the WEST and SW Of CARN
country remains open and offers good tank going.
7•
The River ORNE is a considerable hindrance to movement
for 40 miles above CAN, and constatut es with the CAN Canal, a
good obstacle below it.
