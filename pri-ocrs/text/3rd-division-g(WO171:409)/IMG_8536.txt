Water levels and effects of demolition
(i)
It is known that brs and sluices in
CAEN and sea. locks at OULSIREHA have
been chanbered or prepared for
denolition.
It is probable
brs will be prepered,
that all
though no detailed
reports received.
(ii)
R ONE is at present tidal from mouth
to barrage at ChEN ( 044681) with range
of ? 10 ft at barrage.
(iii)
The canal is lock controlled and the
level is normally 23' 5" above IW Datun.
Tide levels at OUISTREHIM are : -

(iv)
The
effect of
destruction of the OSSARSHAM
locks
alone will be to make
the whole
canal as far as ChiN terminal hazbour
tidol with an estimated maxinun average
ronge of 22 ft (high spring tides) and a
minimum depth of approximately 3 Pt.
The speed of flow under above conditions
ice estimated to be :-
(v)
at
OUTSTREHM Lock
12 mph
Just SOUTH OF
OUISTREAM Lock
4 mph
BENOUVILTE
2.8 mph
and subtract 0.5 aph for emery mile from
OUISTREHAM Lock,
These corditions
will
persist for 4 hrs on every rise and fall
the
tide, with a period of slacker
water in between.
Additional effect of destruction of sluices
in terminal harbour
and R ORNE barrage at
CAEN will be to make the whole system
tidal as far as BULLY 9958 (the noxi don
on R ORNE) which will probably have
Little effect on tidal range on speeds of
flow on either River or Canal, but wilt
prevent any control being exercised over
canal water levels.
