The majority of the infantry strongpoints on
this sector of the coast appear to be of
Less
than reinforced platoon strength.
They are to
great extent concentrated in built-up
areas,
buildings being demolished where necessary.
(ii) Concrete
Personnel
shelters exist in all but the
smallest strongpoints.
Shelters and pillboxes
constructed in 1943
and 1944 probably have walls
and rosis 2 metres thick;
1 metre is the thickness
of carlier work.
(iii)
Flamethrowors
The presence of remotely controlled flame-
thrower's
is contirmed in strongpoints au
OUIST WHAM and WEST Of LA BRECHE 087806.
It is
estimated that these flamethrowers throw a jet
a distance of 35 - 45 yards with a duration
of 5 - 10 seconas,
or an increased jet of 65 yards
with a shorter duration.
While there are no
other reports of flamethrowers in the
(iv)
built up area, possibly in the first story of
houses on the
sea-front.
A detailed schedule of minor defences in
strongpoints is given on the following pages.
