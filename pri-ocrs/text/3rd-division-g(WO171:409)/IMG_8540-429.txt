DISPOSICIONS
Reference Appendix C.
(a)
736 Infantry Regiment holds the coast with two
battalions up from
incl FRANCEVILLE PLAGE 1579 to incl
TRACY-SUR-MER
8486 (approximately 20 miles).
Inter
battalion boundary LUC-SUR-MER 0483 - CRESSERONS 04.80
(Left battalion 12 miles;
Right battalion 8 miles).
Reserve battalion area :
BIEVILLE 0674 - CAEN.
(b)
Forward Battalions
Battalions on the coast have no reserve companies.
The
three rifle companies, reinforced from the MG
all man strongpoints.
Company sectors are
shown at Appendix C.
(c) Reserve Battalion
Its present position is undoubtedly only a
billeting area.
Its role will be counter attack
forward near the beaches.
The HQ layout and the
battalion sectors within 736 Regiment show that CARN
and the approaches to it from the coast are the pivot
the der ence.
Therefore the reserve battalion
is likely to move at stand-to to high ground NORTH
and NW of CAENâ€¢
As this battalion is the sole
reserve in the hands of the regimental commander,
he
is unlikely to cormit it until the direction of the
assault has become clear - say H + 1 hr.
(a)
With the excoption of CAN (sec III - B - Ls' on
there is only one prepared defence belt - that is
the coast.
There is no evidence that the HQ and
battery strongpoints from 2,000 to 4,000 yards inland
form a second line of detence.
