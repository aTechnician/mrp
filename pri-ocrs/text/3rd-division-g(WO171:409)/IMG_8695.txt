The Beach and CAMBIRLEY Folders would, subject to security regulations,
be given out during briefing
so that sub-unit commanders may rehearse
their tasks with their men at other tines than those spent
In briefing
It is felt that they will give confidence
to troops still
see, even in the case of the Reserve Brigade who are expecting to go
straight through.
Proposed scale of issue of both Folders and single larye seale verticals
of picked areas is shown at Appendix A.
5. Intelligence Summaries
No HQs involved in planning will issue Intelligence Summaries during
Exercise BARON, as they woula inevitably go out of date and require amendment.

should be remembered that this Intelligence Summory will provide the information
for the first 14 days battle.
It is not therefore thought wise to issue the
Assault Brigade with a sumary covering only their initial task.
This reasoning
does not however apply to 101 Beach Sub Area.
Folders war photographs will be appended to the Intel
replace them.
