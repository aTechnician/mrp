ii. Second Method.-By a simple proportion sum.
On Plate VII E is the top of a hill which may, or may not,
be visible from the hill A. The hill D is the intervening
feature.
Distance A to D 700 yards.
Distance A to E 1,520 yards.
Difference in height A and D 50 feet.
Difference in height A and E 75 feet.
The line of sight from A to E rises 75 feet in 1,520 yards. The
amount it will rise in 700 yards is found by proportion as
follows: —
700 : 1,520 : : x : 75
700X75
or x= -
1,520*
=34•5 feet
It therefore passes about 15 feet below the summit of D and
E will not be visible from A.
iii. Third Method.-By drawing a section (Plate VII):
ground (ground invisible to the observer) is clearly shown.
iv. Fourth Method.-By proportion (Plate VII).
Join the line AB. The terminal heights are 303 and 403,
and the difference is 100 feet (or four times the V.I.). Divide
the line AB into parts representing the H.Es. between A (303)
and 325, 325 and 350, 350 and 375, 375 and 400, and between
400 and B (403) •
For example (measurements were made in this instance
with a centimetre scale, but any convenient unit may
be used).
AB is 9•7 cms.
Now the 1st H.E. (measured from A) is
100°f 9 - 7 or 2 • 13 cms.
The 2nd, 3rd and 4th HEs. are each 100 of 9•7 or
2•43 cms., and the three measure.. ..

The last H.E. is— of 9•7.. ..

Set off these measurements, and the points marked indi-
cate where the line of sight is at a height of 325, 350, 375
and 400 feet.
Compare these heights with the actual
con-
tours of the map and see whether at any point the ground is
higher than the line of sight.
it is obvious, on inspection, that the ground near is higher
than the line of sight, and that A and B are not intervisible.
This method is convenient and quick.
The division can be
made on a separate piece of paper, which is then laid on the
map.
NorE.-A very practical application of this method is as follows: —
Take a piece of elastic ribbon. Mark on it devisions of equal size,
