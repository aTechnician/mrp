3. On the map draw
straight line, AD (Fig. 13),
running through the portion of the hill of which a section is
required. Mark on this line the points at which it is inter-
sected by the contours; then, either on the map, or on a
separate sheet of paper, draw a horizontal line of equal
length, AD, representing the level of the lowest contAt
and mark accurately thereon the contour intersections.
each of these points erect a perpendicular line and mark on
the right and
left uprights equidistant points representing
the V.I. to which the map is drawn. The vertical scale

should be exaggerated to about six times the horizontal scale,
otherwise the differences in height may not be appreciable.
Through the equidistant points draw lines parallel to the
lowest line, and mark these lines successively, corresponding
to the heights of the contours which they represent.
From
X draw a line ascending through the intersection of the vertical
lines with the contour lines until the bill-top is reached, and
descending similarly to Y.
4. From this sketch (Fig. 13) it can again be clearly seen
that where the slope is gentle the contours are far apart, and
where steep they are close together. (See also Plate VII and
Fig. 14.)
