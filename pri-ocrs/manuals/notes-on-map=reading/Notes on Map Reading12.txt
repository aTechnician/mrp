Therefore x=5•68 inches.
The length of a scale should be calculated to the second
decimal of an inch, or the first of a millimetre.
Draw a line 5•68 inches long and divide it into 5 equal
division into 5 parts, each representing 100 yards, as shown
in Fig. 1.
Example 2.—To construct a scale of 1/100,000 to show
quarter miles.
Here 1 mile is represented by 1/100,000 mile=63,360/100,-
000 inch=0•634 inch. Hence, if the scale is to represent 10
miles in all, its total length will be 6-34 inches.
With the dividers bisect the total length of 6•34 inches, and
divide each half into five. The primary on the left will be
sub-divided into 4 secondaries, each representing ‡ mile.
(Fig. 2.)
Example 3.—To construct a scale of 1/25,000 to show 100
metres.
On this scale, since 100,000 centimetres=1 kilo-
metre, the length representing a kilometre will be
100,000/25,000=4 cms., that is, about 1}
inches.
Consequently 4 kms. can be shown on about 6 inches of
scale. In the absence of a scale of centimetres, we
may proceed thus—
1 metre=39-370 inches; therefore 4 kms.=157,480 inches,
represented by 157,480/25,000=6-30 inches. Divide this
length into eight parts, each representing 500 metres. Sub-
divide the left primary into five secondaries, each of about t
inch, representing 100 metres. See Fig. 3 and compare it with
the scale of metres on the same R.F., on a service protractor.
2. As the value of a scale depends in a great measure
upon the accuracy with which it is divided into equal parts,
the rollowing method may be adopted:-
