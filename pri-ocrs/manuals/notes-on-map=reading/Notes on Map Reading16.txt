From which x=5•68", and the scale will be drawn and
figured as shown in Fig. 5.

16. The Choice of Scale
Maps supplied to the army, in peace or war, vary in scale
from a quarter of an inch to
inches to the mile.

Large scale

22 inches to the mile) are used for special
types of

inch to the mile, are issued for specially mobile operations,
and for transport and communications.
The scale at which a field sketch is made depends on the
object in view.
and therefore on the amount of information
regarding the features of the country which is required.
is important that the student should realize that the area of
paper in a map or sketch varies as the square of the number
of inches to the mile (or of centimetres to the kilometre).
Thus a portion of ground of a given area will cover four times
as much paper on a scale of 2 inches to the mile as on a scale
of 1 inch to the mile.
Beware then of attempting to crowd
upon a sketch at a scale of 1 inch to the mile all the detail
and information

1 to 4 inches to 1 mile. Sketches which may be required for
the defence of a village or town, or for the selection of a camp
or billeting area, are generally made on scales ranging fron
inches to 1 mile and upward
