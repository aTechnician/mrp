A convenient road goes up a hill on which the contours
(V.I. of 50 feet) are, at the minimum, 100 yards (or 300 feet)
apart. What is the gradient?

and the road is therefore passable.
The problem might, however, be solved by answering the
question: What is the distance in plan between contours at
a gradient of 1/5?

and, as the contours are actually further apart than this, the
road is passable.
36. Visibility
1. It is often of importance to discover from the map
whether two points are mutually visible. On perfectly open
ground, ve. without trees, hedges, buildings or other obstruc-
tion, one point will be visible from another so long as the
ground does not rise above the line joining them.
Thus, if
the country between two points is level, evenly sloping,
concave, or lower than both of them (e.g. a valley), they will
be intervisible. On the other hand, where a hill or a convex
slope intervenes, one point will not be visible from the other
(Plate VII and
Fig. 13).
2. Visibility problems can often be answered by
simple
inspection of a contoured map or sketch, but occasionally
there may be doubt. For example, a hill between the two
oints may be higher than one of them, but if it does not rise
bove the line joining them they will still be intervisible
It is not easy to decide this point by inspection, and a quick
method of finding the right answer is required. Before describ-
ing that method a word of caution is necessary.
3. The extent to which visibility problems can be solved
from the map depends upon the size of the V.I. If the V.I.
1s small, e.g. 10 feet, the unrepresented ground features are
small, and visibility can be determined with some accuracy,
and yet, even so, features higher than a man's eye may cause
the facts to disagree with a perfectly correct sum. But if he
V.I. is large, e.g. 50 or 25 feet, the unrepresented ground
