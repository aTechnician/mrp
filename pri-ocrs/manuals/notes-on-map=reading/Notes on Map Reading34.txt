cannot be rectangular. It is usual to make one grid line
coincide with a meridian. On this "standard" meridian the
grid points to the true nerth. All other vertical grid lines are
drawn parallel to it, and do not point to the true north, but
in each
case to a different and imaginary point called the
grid north.
From Fig. 20 it will be seen that grid north is east of true
north when
east of the standard meridian, and west of true
north when west of that meridian.
The angle between grid north and true north is known as
"the angle of convergence," and it is evident that this angle

increases the farther the grid departs from the standard
meridian.
ili. Magnetic North.-Magnetie north is the direction in
which the compass needle points (unaffected by any local
attraction): i.e. the direction of the magnetic pole at any
point. The magnetic north pole changes from year to year,
and thus the magnetic variation, which is the angle between
true north and magnetic north, varies from year to year as
well as from place to place.
Plate VIII shows the value of the magnetic variation all
over the world in 1927. At present (1927) the variation of
the cumpass in Great Britain and Ireland varies between 13°
west in the east of England and 19° west in the west of
Ireland, and it is diminishing by about 11 minutes annually.
It should be noted here that (a) every ordinary compass
has its own individual variation which will differ by a constant
amount from the local magnetic variation, and (b) compasses
