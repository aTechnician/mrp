INTRODUCTION
This manual is intended for the use of candidates for com-
missions in the Regular Army and in the Royal Air Force,
and also for the instruction of officers and non-commissioned
oficers. Its object is to provide sufficient instruction in the
use of maps to enable the student to visualize, appreciate,
and make good use of the tactical features of the ground.
It reproduces Part I of a larger "Manual of Map Reading,
Photo Reading and Field Sketching."
These notes will be used in connection with examinations
for certificates of education.
