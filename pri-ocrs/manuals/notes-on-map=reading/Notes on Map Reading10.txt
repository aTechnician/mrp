I1. Methods of expressing Scale
1. The scale may be described in two ways
i. In words showing the relation between any unit on the
map and any other on the ground.— As the inch is
the unit by which the eye judges small distances,
and distances are generally given in miles, English
scales are generally made to show a certain number
of "inches to the mile" or "miles to an inch."
The statement is usually in miles to one inch for
the one inch and smaller scales:
whereas it is
usually in inches to the mile at scales larger than
the one inch. Maps of countries which use the
"metre" are, however, generally made to show
a certain number of centimetres to a kilometre.
ii. By the Representative Fraction (commonly known as
the R.F.), which expresses the same relation in
the terms
of a fraction with "one" as numerator,
the denominator being expressed in the same unit,
e.g. 1/100. It is obvious that the relation expressed
by the fraction remains unaltered whatever the
unit employed may be.
The advantage of using the R.F. is that the relation in
scale between maps which employ different units can be
established at once (see example).
Examples.-The following examples explain the two ways
of expressing scales:—
i. Scale 1/63,360 or 1 inch to 1 mile. Here 1 inch
the map represents on the ground
63,360
inches, i.e. 1 mile.
i1. Scale 1/100,000, or 1 centimetre to 1 kilometre. Here
1 inch on
the map represents on the ground
100,000 inches=1•58 miles; or 1 centimetre on
the map represents on the ground 100,000 cms.=
1 kilometre.
2. Supposing that the R.F. alone is given, the number of
"miles to the inch" or "inches to the mile" can be found
in the following ways:—
i. To find the number of miles on the ground corre-
sponding to 1 inch, on a map for which the R.F.
is given, divide the denominator of the R.F. by
li. To tind the rumber of inches on the map correspond.
ing to 1 mile on the ground, divide 63,360 by the
denominator of the R.F.
