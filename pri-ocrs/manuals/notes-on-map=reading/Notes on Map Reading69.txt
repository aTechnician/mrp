Liquid Sounds.-The occas onal

rule sufficiently represented by a following y; where, however, owing to

This sound must not be confused with e-mute, when the e is not
sounded at all: as in Abbeville.

5. Special Rules for Certain Languages.—It is hoped that
in future the system given above will be universal.
space permitted it would not be necessary to print here the
transliteration tables for each language.
published a book of "Alphabets on Foreign Languages
scribed into English according to the R.G.S. II System," but
it is too much to hope that they will be universally adopted.
The surveys of India and Egypt have their own systems for
transliterating, and any change of system would involve many
alterations in existing maps.
Although the use of these rules and tables involves a trans-
literation letter by letter which is designed to give the best
approximation possible to the pronunciation, an expert in both
will constantly be aware
that the transliterated
form does not represent the sound, and many feel tempted to
improve on it; but usually the results must be accepted.
6. Unwritten Languages.—The pronunciation table printed
above is equally essential for arriving at a
suitable form of
spelling names in unwritten languages, such as those in tropical
Africa or the Pacific. Here sound is the only guide, and the
obiect aimed at is to represent the name so that it will be
pronounced correctly by an Englishman.
Even so, certain
spellings which contradict the R.G.S. II System have become
conventional, as the use of the th to render the sound of dh
It is evident that no system of transliteration will
enable a name to be correctly pronounced by people of dif-
ferent nationalities.
7. Chinese and Japanese.
1. It is very desirable that officers to whose lot it falls to
ascertain by word of mouth and to record names should follow
the rules here given. Certain languages require special treat-
ment. For instance, Chinese and Japanese are written langu-
ages but have no alphabet.
It is therefore necessary either
to treat them as unwritten languages and be guided by sound
only, or to prepare eiaborate tables giving the Roman lettering
to be used for each syllable or svmbol.
This was done
Chinese by Sir T. Wade, and his system has been that most
generally used ever since.
The Directorate General of Posts
publishes a list of Post Offices in China, with its own system
of spelling which is not always consistent.
