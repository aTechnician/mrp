scales. The only difficulty arises on certain maps, about the
scale of 1/100,000, where the distance between grid lines is
5,000 instead of the ordinary 100 or 10,000.
Fig. 29 illustrates
the way in which references can be given on such maps with
the aid of a
"Romer."
In cases such as that illustrated by
Fig. 29 the unit of reference is still 100 yards, but the division
by eye into fiftieths is impossible-with a Romer it is easy
if care be taken.
The Romer scales are divided into main
divisions of 0 to 5 nearest
the
margin
and from 5 to 10
farthest from the margin. If the distance from east and north
is already more than an odd 5 (i.e. more than 15, 25, 35, etc.)
the scale farthest from the margin is used.
distance
from east and
north is more than an even 10 or less than
an odd 5, use that nearest to the margin.
2. Plate XIII shows how marginal figures are given
on
some foreign gridded
maps of to-day.
Note that on the
German, as on some other systems, the figures for reference
are printed larger than the
(and for reference
unnecessary) survey figures.
The same procedure is followed
in the Modified British System.
CHAPTER VIII
SETTING THE MAP AND FINDING POSITION
ON IT
52. Setting a Map
A map is said to be set or "oriented" when it is laid out
direct correspondence with the ground so that the true
north on the map corresponds to the North Point. If, after
setting, the directions between features on the ground are then
compared with the same directions as shown on the map,
they will be seen to be parallel. A map may be set by
compass or by objects recognizable both on the ground and
on the map.
53. Setting by Compass
1. Lay the compass, opened, over the "magnetic north"
line (produced if necessary) given on the map, so that the
notches representing the zero line of the compass fall directly
over the magnetic north line of the map.
and compass together until the needle pointing to magnetic
north is on the same line. The map is now set.
