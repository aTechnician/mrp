The area of a square may be indicated by the co-ordinates
of the S.W. corner—e.g. Bivouac area squares Q.70 and Q.71
—or squares 7363-7463 (according to scale).
47. On Cross Referenon between Farge and Small Scale
Maps (modified British)
Consider Fig. 27. A commands a force operating in the
area of the quarter-inch sheet outlined. B commands a unit
working on a standard (1/50,000) map covering the hatched
P 9
FIG. 27.
A's references in orders, etc., are of the type Q.3145.
B will naturally follow those orders on the quarter inch, but
for his own purposes will use a reference of the type 308451
If B reports activity at 483608, A knowing his locality, will
look for Q4861 on the quarter inch.
48. Instruction on the Grid System
Emphasis in instruction should be put on lines rather than
on squares.
Squares are formed, of course, by the intersec-
tion at right angles of two sets of equally spaced parallel
lines, but they are not essential to the system.
The lines,
on the other hand, are essential and act as a set of scales by
which to measure the distances ON and NP of Fig. 26.
The tendency to think in squares leads to three undesir-
able results:—
i. The inclusion of numbers in small squares all over the
map.
ii. The idea of a square of fixed size. On scales so differ-
ent aa the 1/25,000 (or 24 inch) and the 1/250,000 (or
quarter inch) this is impossible.
iii. The inversion of references. Thus in a square in which
31 appears (often called square 31) the impulse is often to
refer to a point as 3106 instead
of 3016.

49. " Romers"
or Reference Cards
It is possible in ordinary referencing to estimate the required
tenths, provided the side of the square does not exceed 12
to 2 inches. If particular accuracy is required a romer,

this figure it is obvious that the position of O is roughly
4/10ths East and 6/10ths North from the appropriate East
and North lines. The divisions of a Romer allow of a more
correct measurement than can be made by eye, and if neces-
sary can be further subdivided by estimation.
Thus, in Fig
28, it is seen that O is 41/100ths East and 59/100ths North
*If romers are not issued, they can be made on a piece of paper
or cardboard as follows:
Take one corner of a sheet of paper
cardboard and number it nought.
Set off along both edges the distance
between grid lines.
Subdivide this distance into tenths and number
them from 0-10 outwards from the corner or zero point.
