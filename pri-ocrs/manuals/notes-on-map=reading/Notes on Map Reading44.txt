the point of
reference.
Thus, the point P in Fig. 26 (a) is 6 and 3 tenths
units east and 3 and 5 tenths units north of the point of
reference.
It lies in square vH; its reference is therefore
vH 6335.

4. The ‡ inch to 1 mile map.
The grid in this case is the same as that on the 10 miles to
1 inch, but owing to the larger scale it is possible, without
unduly obscuring the detail, to print the letters of the 100 km.
squares and the numbers of the 10 km, squares as shown in
Fig. 26 (b). The sides of the 100 km. lettered squares are
thickened and the reference letter to the 500 km. square is
shown in smaller type in brackets.
The reference of the point P in Fig. 26 (b) is the same as
in that in Fig.
26 (a), viz. (v)H 6335, but in this case the
smaller letter is usually omitted. (See also Plate XI).
5. 1 inch to 1 mile and larger scale maps.
On maps of these scales, since there is no possibility of
duplication, the letters referring to the 500 km. and the 100 km,
squares are omitted from the grid.
A small diagram in the
map margin indicates the letter (or letters) of the 100 km.
