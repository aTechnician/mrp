the constant alterations and additions in a highly civilized
area soon render the best work out of date. The fact that
the major portion of the British soldier's instruction will be
based on Ordnance Survey maps should not be permitted
to lead to an appreciation of Ordnance Survey methods and
symbols only.
Constructive common sense and not slavish imitation is
the goal to be reached.
Since the "man-in-the-street" is not a qualified map
reader, much information is always included in the margin
of a map, and the student should be trained to make full
use of the data thus supplied and to know where to look for
the following information:â€”
i. What locality it deals with.
ii. Its scale.
iii. Its orientation, and the local magnetic variation
(north point).
iv. The conventional signs it employs.
v. The contour system and interval.
vi. The date of issue or revision.
vii. By whom and how it was made.
vill. The system of reference and grid employed.
ix. The names and numbers of adjoining sheets.

4. Map Marginal Lines
In the course of his service a soldier will deal with all sizes
and shapes of map. The only point of consequence in those
differences, which do not affect the picture of the ground,
is the curved (graticule), as opposed to the rectangular
(grid), shape of the bounding lines of some maps. The dif-
ference is clearly brought out in Plate I, and should be ex-
plained with particular reference to the use of true and grid
norths. The practical advantages of a grid for references
and for the work of surveying and mapping in the field may
here be explained. The maps of Great Britain and of India
are the obvious examples to use of rectangular and geo-
but unessential points as the
position of the origin or the type of projection should form
no part of the instruction.
5. Instruction Indoors
The practical application of map reading should be
emphasized throughout.
