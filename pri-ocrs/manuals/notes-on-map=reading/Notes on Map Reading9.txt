as the plans of the lines at which a water surface (of
the ocean, for instance) would intersect the surface of
the earth were it raised successively by equal amounts.
Contour Interval.-The difference in level between two
adjacent contours (generally known as the Vertical
Interval).
Datum or Datum Levei.-The level to which altitudes are
referred.
Detail.-All minor natural or artificial features of the ground
or on the ground.
Fall of a River-Its slope,
usually measured in inches (or
feet) to the mile, thus: 9 inches to the mile.
Fixed Point.—A point is fixed when its position is known and
can be plotted on paper in correct relationship to other
points.
Form Line.-An approximate contour; a sketch contour.
Gradient.—A slope
expressed by a fraction.
Thus 1/30
represents a rise or fall of 1 foot in a distance of 30
Graticule.—A system of four-sided figures formed by lines
which represent portions of meridians and parallels.
Grid.--A system of squares formed by lines which represent
progressive distances east and north of a fixed origin.
Grid North.-The lines of a grid point nearly, but not quite,
west. Those which me ney toot quite, east ane
Grid North lines.
Hachures.—Vertical hachuring is a conventional method of
representing hill features by shading in short discon-
nected lines drawn directly down the slopes in the
direction of the flow of water on the slopes.
Horizontal Equivalent (usually written H.E.).—Is the dis-
tance in plan between two adjacent contours.
Latitude.-The latitude of a place is the arc of the meridian
from the place to the equator, expressed in degrees
at the centre of the earth.
Local Magnetic Attraction.-Is the deviation of the magnetic
needle of
a compass from its mean position, owing
to the presence of masses of magnetie iron ore or of
iron in the neighbourhood.
Longitude.-The longitude of a place is the angle at the
pole between
the meridian of that place and some
standard meridian (generally the meridian of Green-
wich).
