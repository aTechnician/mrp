tracing paper as follows:—
Pin a piece of tracing paper on a board and lay a ruler upon
it.
From any convenient point marked on the paper as a
pivot, and without moving the board,
draw a line along the
straight edge of the ruler in the direction of
each of three
known distant points.
Then remove the piece of tracing
paper from the board and apply
it to the map so that the
three lines pass through the distant points, as marked on the
map; the
pivot point is the required position and can be
pricked through.
If tracing paper is not available, ordinary
paper may serve the purpose.
CHAPTER IX
COPYING AND ENLARGING A MAP
57. Copying a Map
Maps which are to be copied at the same scale i.e. without
reduction or enlargement-may be first traced on tracing
paper, and then transferred to a fresh sheet of paper as
follows:—
Place a piece of carbon paper between the tracing and a
clean sheet of paper and fasten both down by drawing pins.
Now follow the lines with a pointed instrument and
thus
"transfer" them to the fresh paper.
In the field, an excellent
substitute for
carbon paper can be made by
pencil dust on a piece of thin paper. Any sharp piece of wood
will do for the tracing instrument.
may also be
transferred direct without a tracing; but there is some danger
of damaging the original with the point.
