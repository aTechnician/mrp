Example 3 (Fig. 25):-
M.N. G.N.
Magnetic north is 13° West of Grid North.
Grid bearing is 340°.
What is magnetic bearing?
Magnetic bearing=340° +13°=353°

CHAPTER VII
SYSTEMS OF REFERENCE
THE GRID, AND HOW TO GIVE AND READ REFERENCES
42. The Principle of a Reference
The purpose of this chapter is to enable the student to
understand the methods of reference used in describing the
position of a point on the various
maps he may be called upon to
use.
A few preliminary remarks are
necessary.
If we look at Fig. 26,
which
represents two lines XOX' and
., drawn at right angles and
crossing one another at , and
presuppose that the position
point O is known, the position of point P can be described by
the lengths of ON and NP (where NP is perpendicular to
XOX', or parallel to YOY').
The basic principle of the systems of reference under dis-
cussion is that outlined above.
In all systems XOX' and
YOY' are, respectively, east-west and north-south lines, and
ON and NP are termed eastings and northings.
