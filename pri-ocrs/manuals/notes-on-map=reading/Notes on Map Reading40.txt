2. An extract from a sheet of the 1/20,000 series of Great
Britain (now obsolete) is given on Plate X. This is the scale
for which this particular system was designed. The squares
represent the same areas on the ground as those on the one-
inch sheet, and are lettered in the four corners, but as 1/20,000
is about three inches to the mile, the sides of these squares
are about three times as long as on the one-inch.
Thick lines,
as before, bound the 10-kilometre squares, and thin lines divide
them up.
References are easier than on the one-inch, because
in each little (kilometre) square are printed two figures, the
first of
which is the number (eastwards) of the west edge,
whilst the second is the number (northwards) of the south
edge.
Refer to Plate X (which shows only a portion of a
big square) and consider "old chalk pit" which lies in the little
It will be seen to be one-tenth of a kilometre
eastards in this little square and the easting is therefore 21.
similarly, it lies
7-tenths north and the northing is 17.
The full reference is then Q.2117.

45. The Modified British System
1. In the British System the whole system of reference is
repeated every 50 kms.; thus in the smaller scale maps
it is possible to have on the same sheet two identical map
references referring
; to two different places. The Modified
British System obviates this difficulty.
2. In this system the area is divided into squares of 500
kms. side, each of which is designated by & letter. Each of
these squares is subdivided into 25 squares of 100 kms. side
which are also lettered from "A" to "Z"
omitting the letter
"I"
These squares are again subdivided, each into 100
squares of 10 kms. side.
3. The 10 miles to 1 inch map.
The sides of each 100 km, square are thickened; the
appropriate letter is printed in the centre of the square,
and to the left of it smaller type is printed also the letter
of the 500 km. square in which the 100 km, square falls.
Of the grid lines forming the sides of the 10 km. squares,
every
fifth-horizontally and vertically-is numbered,
as
bottom corner of the 100 km. lettered square in which it lies.
This is the point to which map references are normally
