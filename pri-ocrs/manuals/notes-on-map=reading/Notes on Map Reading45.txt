The 10 km. squares are further subdivided into 100 squares
of 1 km. side; the sides of the 10 km. squares are thickened
and the grid lines are numbered as shown in Fig. 26 (c).
The
number appearing
on
any
grid line denotes,
this time in
kilometre units,
the distance of the grid line north or east of
the point of reference.
In the sheet margin every grid line

is so numbered and to every tenth number is added, in smaller
print, the figure required to convert the shortened co-ordinate
into the full co-ordinate referred to the (false) origin of the
grid system.
A pin
point reference can be given to the
nearest tenth of a kilometre.
Thus, in Fig. 26 (c) the point Q is 53 and 3 tenths units
east and 67 and 5 tenths units north of the point of reference.
Its reference is therefore 533675.
The appropriate square letter may be included before the
reference, but this is not normally necessary. (See also Plate
XII.)
46. On References generally
During training and at exercises or manœuvres at home
stations,
it is
common to rely in orders or reports upon
51
familiar names of towns, villages, cross-roads, etc., and to
omit references.
In war, or in training overseas, the danger
of this practice is at once apparent.
Unfamiliar names and the mistakes which may have been
made in spelling or transliterating them are likely to intro-
duce doubt and confusion.
When the name of a town,
village, wood, stream,
etc., is
mentioned
for the first time
in an order or report a grid
reference must be given.

FIG. 26 (c).
The essential point is that references
should be clear to
the recipient.
Within large squares (e.g. 1,000 metre sauares
at 3 inches to the mile) full of names and close mapping
detail full references should be given.
Within small squares
(e.g. 1,000 metre squares on the one inch) and with bold
names and clear mapping the reference may be simplified.
As long as it is clear and unmistakable the reference may
be given by the co-ordinates of the S.W. corner of the square
-e.g. 3207, or Q. 70, etc., according to scale.
It is often necessary to refer to
poses.
