8. Double Transliteration.-Many other difficulties arise.
For instance, a name of Russian origin may appear on a map
transliterated into German. To get it in its correct form by
our rules it would be necessary to put it back into Russian
and then transliterate it afresh
Fr. Tchernigov,
Tschernigow, Eng. Chernigov. Native
are transliterated by other Powers according to
their own rules and pronunciation, and a fresh transliteration
is required for an English map. Examples are:-

names, as far as it goes, and to adapt the spelling of
Chinese names to the Postal system, such as it is.
2. A similar
system has been prepared for Japanese by
Mr. Hepburn; but the Japanese publish official maps giving
the names in Roman lettering, and these would presumably
be accepted.
The Land Survey Department has,
recently introduced a new system of spelling which differs
considerably from the well-established system used by
Imperial Geological Survey.
also has to be specially
treated, for the Greek alphabet is so familiar that it is usually
more useful to be able to recognize the original letters than
to put the name into a strange form even if that form gives
the correct pronunciation.
Thus the letter & is always trans-
literated by ph and not by f.
