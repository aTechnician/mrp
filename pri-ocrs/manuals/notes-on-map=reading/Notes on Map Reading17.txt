CHAPTER IV
CONVENTIONAL SIGNS
17. The Object of Conventional Signs
1. Conventional signs are used where there is no room on
paper to show the true outline, or to add a written descrip-
tion. For example, a church is shown in its correct ground
plan
on a six-inch
ordnance
survey map, and alongside is
given its name, but on a one-inch map the church is shown
by a conventional sign and no name is given.
The smaller
the scale, the less room
and description
nd the greater becomes the number of obiects which must
be shown conventionally.
2.
A map can show
objects only in plan.
Being itself
flat it cannot indicate the
height of objects.
Heights are
shown conventionally,
either by writing a number of feet or
metres against an object such as bank or cutting, or by the
methods described in the next chapter for showing ground
features.
18. The Nature of Conventional Signs
For ease of recognition, conventional signs are as sugges-
tive of the object represented as possible.
Thus the sign for
a windmill could
scarcely be mistaken
for
anything
else,
and a cross or crescent is included in the respective symbols
of churches or mosques. The conventional sign for any object
is generally made to approximate to the appearance of that
object as viewed from above, with the
exception
of trees,
in which case the side view or elevation is always shown on
Ordnance Survey maps.
Signs should be as simple as pos-
sible to facilitate drawing and printing.
19. Ordnance Survey Signs and Signs on Royal Air Force
Maps
1. As Ordnance Survey maps will constitute the basis of
the training of the young soldier, it is important that the
symbols employed on them should be carefully studied. They
are shown on Plates II and IIA, and the more important
of these symbols will be found
in the bottom
corner of any one-inch sheet.

air pilots.
