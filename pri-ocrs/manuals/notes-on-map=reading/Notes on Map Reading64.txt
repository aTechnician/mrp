APPENDIX I
FINDING TRUE NORTH FROM SUN OR STAR
1. True North by Compass.—True north is readily obtained
from magnetic north if the variation of the compass is known.
The compass, magnetic
variation and the
finding of true
north in this way have already been explanied in Chapter VI.
2. True North by Watch and Sun.-Lay the watch flat with
the hour hand pointing to the sun. In the northern hemi-
sphere the direction of true south is then midway between the
In the southern hemisphere point XII

Thus, in northern hemisphere, time 15•00 hrs. With watch
set as descried

lies in the direction midway
between
the figures 1 and 2 and north in the opposite
direction.
This method is very rough. It is of no use in the tropics.
The further away from the equator the more
accurate it
Replacing the watch by a 24-hour dial drawn on
the sketch does not make for much greater accuracy in the
absence of a special device.
If summer time is in force
correct the watch before taking the observation.
3. True North by the Sun.—The method described below is
one of "Equal Altitudes."
Drop some sealing wax on a penny
and press down thereon the flat end of a pencil, taking care
that the latter is truly upright and central on the face of the
"style"
so formed on a table in the open,
to which a square of white paper is pinned.
Run a pencil
point round the coin and find its centre O (Fig. 58).
At about
10•00 note that the shadow of the pencil's point is at A.
Mark A and ioin it to O and with OA as radius draw the
circle C around O.
Note that as the sun moves the shadow
at the same time traces an arc (dotted, Fig. 58)
At about 13•45 examine the shadow again; note that it is
again approaching the circle. At about 14•00 the apex of the
shadow again crosses the circle; mark the point of crossing, B.
Then ON, which bisects the angle AOB, is the direction of
true north in the northern hemisphere, or true south in the
southern hemisphere.
