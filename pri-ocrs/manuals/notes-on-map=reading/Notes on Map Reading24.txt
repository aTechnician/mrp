CHAPTER V
RELIEF AND ITS REPRESENTATION
25. Hill Features and Methods of Representing them
The chief difficulty felt by most students in map reading
is that of understanding the methods used to represent hill
features.
There are several ways in which hill features and
heights may be indicated on a flat surface, viz: —
i. Contours (including form lines).
ii. Hachures.
iii. Hill Shading.
iv. Layer Tints.
v. Spot Heights.
Methods i and ii are distinct in themselves and are
seldom combined on the same map.
Method iii is rarely
found except in conjunction with either i or ii. Method iv
is invariably associated with contours i, and method v is
used on practically every map, in connection with one or
other method or combination of methods.
26. Description of Contours
These are best explained by the following simple practical
illustrations:—
All students will be familiar with the ordinary wooden
or plaster models sometimes used to represent, in relief, hills
and other geographical features. Say we have such a model,
the scale of which we know to be 1/12, i.e. 1 inch on the
model representing 1 foot on the ground. Place the model
in an empty tank or bath and pour in water until there 18
a depth of 1 inch in the bath. The watermark will cut the
model all round, 1 inch vertically above its base. Draw this
watermark on the model with a pencil.
Now add water
until there are 2 inches in the bath and draw in the second
watermark. Continue to add water by inches in this way,
and to draw in the successive watermarks, until the model is
colapletely covered with water.
On removing the model it will be found to be marked with
& succession of lines which are vertically 1 inch above the
other (Fig. 9). These lines are "Contours."
Now if a drawing of the model is made, as seen from above,
ie. a plan of the model on the actual scale, "Contours" at
