on the panorama, which is then an assistance to the battery
commander in engaging targets in the zone depicted.
4. Plate XIX shows the same view as Plate XVIII treated
more conventionally for artillery purposes, and amplified by
a table of the relevant data.
It should be noted
that an
indication of the reliability of the information so tabulated
must be given.
The figures given in this Table are not necessarily accurate.
The diagram is to illustrate the method to be employed.
78. Thumbnail Sketches
1. Small sketches, such as shown on Plate XX, should be
used to illustrate descriptions of details
of road turnings,
bridges,
buildings for
demolition,
detours in a road, etc.
For example, in a road
reconnaissance where the only available map is on a small
scale,
such
as 1/250,000,
it is simpler to show an intricate
turn in a village by a sketch such as Fig. 1, Plate XX, than
by making an enlargement of the map and adding the neces-
sary detail. Or again, in a route reconnaissance for
column
moving cross country, the point where a change of direction
is to be made can be given by a sketch, as in Fig. 2, Plate XX,
which shows
the relative position of
detail
at
that point,
such as two houses in line or the relation
between & group
of trees and some feature in the distance.
2. The principles
and methods
of
panorama
drawing
apply equally to the preparation of thumbnail sketches of
positions of special interest.
The sketches are executed by
eye after the main proportions have been lightly sketched in
by measurement, either with the protractor,
as in panorama
drawing,
or by holding the pencil at arm's length and mark-
ing off distances on it with the thumb.
Simplicity should be the key-note of all such sketches.
79. Photographs
Liberal use may be made of a camera in a military report.
Such a camera should be small and equipped with a good lens
to enable photographs to be enlarged subsequently. Films
are obviously preferable to plates.
All photographs taken
should be listed and numbered as they
are taken and all
references to them in a report should quote their identifica-
tion number.
Cameras will be found
most useful for the
illustration of local detail, but will be of little use for distant
80. Classification of Roads
1. The bulk of information required about roads for
military purposes can generally be shown on a map or sketch.
To enable this to be done, roads will be classified by letters as
