CHAPTER VI
NORTH POINTS
38. Cardinal Points
Fig. 18 shows the four cardinal points, and the more im-
oortant intermediate points of the compass.
Opposite the
cardinal points are marked their readings in degrees.
It is obvious from this figure that a man standing at "p"
and facing the North, has the South immediately behind him,
the East on his right, and the West on his left.
It will also
be seen that there are 360° in a circle, and that these are
reckoned in the same direction as the figures on a watch
beginning at North, which is 0°. In each degree there are
N.360° or. 0°

At any time of the day the sun is a rough guide to orienta-
tion.
Roughly speaking it rises in the East, sets in the West,
and is on the meridian at noon. Without furthur study,
however, it is dangerous to use the position of the sun as
anything more than an approximate guide. The actual bear-
ings of the points of rising and setting vary greatly with the
season and the latitude. It must also be remembered that
"summer time" is an hour ahead of sun time.
Fig. 19 is given in order to show the variation in the bearing
of the points of rising and setting in the latitude of London.
39. Bearings
A bearing is the angle measured clockwise from a certain
fixed line to any line in question.
The fixed line may be the
true North, grid north or magnetic north. Thus, in Fig. 19
