Causes of Bad Slow Running and their Remedy
To obtain good slow running, it is necessary that several items,
other than the carburetter, should be in perfect order, as these
have a very big effect on perfect slow running. The most important
of these are the following :â€”
(I) Sparking plugs: These should be quite clean, especially at
the points, and the gap should be set not wider than half a
millimetre.
(2) The sticking of valves, or if they are not closing properly on
their seatings, has a very big effect on slow running.
should be seen that there is a correct clearance between the
valve tappets and the valve stems to ensure their closing
correctly.
(3) The magneto contact breaker points should be occasionally
examined to see that they are clean, and the gap on the make
and break set to the correct distance advised by the makers.
(See Section V. Magneto.)
(4) Should the engine refuse to run slowly after the above items
have been carefully checked, it is advisable to see that the
slow-running device of the carburetter is not blocked with
dirt. A separate slow-running jet and screw is provided
which can be quickly removed after taking off the screwed
cap.
The screw regulates the volume of slow-running mixture
passing to the edge of the butterfly throttle, where the high
velocity of the air thoroughly atomises the petrol. To adjust
this screw, first tighten it down on its seating, and then un-
screw it approximately half a turn, after which a fraction of a
turn in one direction or the other will give slow, even running
Turning the screw anti-clockwise will strengthen the mixture.
Turning it clockwise will weaken it.
The Main Jet
The main jet in this carburetter controls the amount of fuel
supplied, and is shown in Figs. I and 2, marked "K." It is
screwed into the jet carrier plug, and is withdrawn with this
plug. This jet is calibrated on a standard calibrating machine,
