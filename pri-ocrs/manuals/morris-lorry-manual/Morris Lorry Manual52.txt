tube as far as possible in the acid, then gradually lessen the pressure
on the bulb until the acid solution rises in the barrel lifting the
hydrometer float about 1, in.
Removing the hydrometer from
the cell, note the scale reading at the surface
of the electrolyte; this gives
the density or
specific gravity.
Care must be taken that the
stem of the float does not touch any part of the
barrel or bulb while the reading is actually being
taken.
Period for which a Battery should be Charged
It is difficult to lay down rigid instructions on
this subject, as the
conditions under
which
vehicles are used vary considerably. The follow-
ing suggestion will, however, serve as a rough
guide.
For vehicles running regularly under normal
conditions the battery should be kept on charge
approximately two or three hours dally during
laytime running. This time should be increased
if there has been an extra drain on the batteries,
e.g. if the vehicle has been stationary for longer
periods than usual at night with the lights on.
If it is found that, with the amount of daytime
charging decided on, the density of the acid
is
too high (1.250 or over) and the acid level is
apt to get unusually low, or if, when running, it
is found that the lamp
bulbs are too bright and
are liable to burn out, it is then desirable to cut
down the charging time or the output of the
dynamo (see page 42). Similarly, if the battery
density gets too low (I.150 or under) and the lights

become too dim, especially when standing, either

the charging time should be increased or the
output of the dynamo increased.
It is preferable to increase the charging time rather than the
dynamo output, and an adjustment should only be made when
this is not possible.
