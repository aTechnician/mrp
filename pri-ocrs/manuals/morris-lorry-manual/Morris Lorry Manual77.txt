block, known as a valve port, and it is the tension of the valve

allows the tappet to fall.

After about a thousand miles it will be found that the polished
face of the seating end of the valve will have become dirty, due
to this burning action of the gas, and grinding-in will be required.
The grinding-in is nothing more nor less than cleaning the valve
faces and seatings by rubbing them together with a certain amount
of abrasive material in between, so that they will mate up perfectly
and be absolutely gastight.
In a sense, it is a cleaning process ;
but it also evens up the surfaces.
This is how it is done. By using the special tool shown on
