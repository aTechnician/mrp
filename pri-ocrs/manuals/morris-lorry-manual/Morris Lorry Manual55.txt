Replacement of Bulbs
When replacement of a bulb is necessary, we strongly recom-
mend that bulbs supplied by us be used. The filaments are arranged
to be in focus, and give the best results with our reflectors.
Lucas Service Depots
In the event of difficulty with any part of the equipment, no
matter how trivial, Messrs. Lucas are only too pleased to give
every assistance possible. The best course to adopt is to call at
the nearest Lucas Service Depot, the addresses of which are given
on page 54, when the equipment can be examined as a whole. The
Depots are not only at your disposal for repairs, overhauls and
adjustments, but to give free advice.
If it is necessary to com-
municate by letter, and when ordering spare parts, always give
the type and the number of the unit in question, the make and, if
possible, the date of the vehicle on which it is fitted.
