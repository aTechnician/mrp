essential, therefore, that the load be securely packed so as to prevent
it from shifting when
the vehicle is negotiating severe obstacles

The chain track in position.
Neglect to pay proper attention to this point may result in the load
sliding to the back of the vehicle on a steep gradient, and this,
together with the high torque effort necessary to enable the vehicle
to climb, may result in the steering wheels being lifted clear of the
ground, so putting the vehicle out of control. On the other hand,
should the load slide forward when going downhill, such extra load
may thereby be transferred to the front wheels that excessive
sinkage of these on soft ground may occur, and the vehicle will
become bogged.
On journeys where stretches of loose sand have to be encountered,
it is sometimes advantageous to dispose the load somewhat towards
the rear end of the lorry platform and secure it there in order to
reduce the load and consequent sinkage of the front wheels. Under
