Items Requiring Attention
Remember that a single plate dry type clutch is used on the
Morris-Commercial Six-wheeled Chassis, and on no account must
any lubricant of any description be put into the clutch case.
After 250 miles: Inspect oil level in crankcase, gearbox and rear
axles. Refill if necessary.
After first 300 miles: Remove old oil from gearbox, rear axles
and engine.
Refill with fresh oil.
After first 600 miles: Ditto.
Every 3 months: Examine valves and valve seatings, and scrape
off carbon deposit from pistons and head.
Remove bottom
case, clean oilpump and filter.
Every 1000 miles: Drain engine, gearbox and driving axles.
Refill with fresh oil. Oil magneto; three drops in each oil
hole.
Every month: Remove all wheels, clean and rub studs over with
grease and then replace, taking care to put a little oil on the
detachable wheel nuts.
This precaution prevents the wheels
rusting up and becoming difficult to detach. See that
wheel hub cap nuts are tight.
Fill hubs with thin grease
Examine valve tappet clearance, and if more than stated
on page 12 readjust.
Examine the gaps of the sparking plugs and make sure
that they are not too wide; the thickness of a visiting
card makes a suitable gauge.
Every week: Oil the steering, gear, inspect oil level in engine,
attach oil gun to all lubricators and oil sufficiently.
Every
day: See that RADIATOR is full of water.
The water
level should never be allowed to sink so low that the opening
for cylinder outlet-pipe is not fully covered.
