Driving with Tracks Fitted
Conditions which necessitate the use of tracks will, as previously
indicated, be so severe as to require every care upon the part of
the driver in order to successfully negotiate severe obstacles.
In
addition the vehicle should be steered with great care when thus
Possiblery sharp turns on full lock being avoided as far as it is
Tree stumps, hidden boulders, and gulleys should be
carefully looked for when driving across unfamiliar ground, and all
steep gradients should be taken so that the vehicle is not lying
over sideways at any great angle.
Furthermore, over ground
which is known to be soft, where sinkage is liable to be excessive,
a route should be chosen, where possible, upon which grass or other
vegetation is growing, an even slow speed being maintained so
that as little as possible the surface and support of the ground is
destroyed.
Limit of Vehicle's Performance
The successful negotiation of exceptionally severe obstacles will
to some extent depend upon the driver's skill in handling
his
machine, and it is presumed that such a driver would avoid the
necessity to have to change gear while, for example, crossing a
muddy portion of the route or negotiating a gradient greater than
1 in 5. As a guide to the climbing capabilities of the Morris-Com-
mercial Six-wheeled Truck when carrying the specified cross-
country load of 1 ton, gradients of 1 in 2! may be successfully
climbed (with the tracks in use) even by a moderately skilled driver.
Without the tracks, and with the tyre treads in fairly good con-
dition, dry grass-covered gradients as steep as 1 in 3l may be safely
tackled.
