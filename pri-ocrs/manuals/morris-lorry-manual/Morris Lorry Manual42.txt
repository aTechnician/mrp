te the magneto has been recently replaced, it is possible that it
may have been timed incorrectly. Instructions
for timing
are
given on page 12, but unless the reader is used to it, retiming the
magneto is by no means a simple matter, and he would be well
advised to have this done for him by his nearest service depot or
garage.
If, after carrying out the above examination, there is
still doubt or difficulty about the ignition system, it is little use
continuing the examination,
and he is strongly advised
to
consult the nearest Lucas Service Depot, the addresses of which
are given on page 54.
If the reader is able to call, this is the best course to adopt, as
the engine, with its ignition equipment, can then be examined as
a whole. If it is necessary, however, to write, the reader is reminded
to be sure, in addition to describing his trouble, to state the type
of the magneto and its serial number, both of which should
found on the side of the magneto. The reader is cautioned against
needlessly dismantling his magneto, as it is of intricate construc-
tion and is easily damaged.
Lucas Magneto Guarantee
Every Lucas magneto manufactured after Ist August, 1926, bears
" guarantee against all electrical and mechanical breakdowns
any cause, including wear and tear and burning of the contact breaker
points for a period of tro years.
All that the owner need do to ensure that the magneto gives its
best service is to carry out the foregoing instructions for cleaning,
adjustment and lubrication.
In the event of any fault developing in the first two years the
defective magneto or part should be returned to any Lucas Service
Depot, the addresses of which are given on page 54.
It should be noted that Messrs. Lucas's liability consists of making
good the defect in their own depots, and in no case can they hold
themselves responsible for contingent expenses.
