the two bared ends threaded into the terminal sockets, where
they should be soldered in position. Replace the cable plug in
its holder
by
means of the two screws and secure the whole to
the lamp body by means of the coupling nut.
Focussing the Headlamp
The very accurate formation and particularly high finish of the
surtace of the reflector is the result of many years of research work,
manufacturing experience, and prolonged night driving observation
on the road.
If, however, the bulb is not correctly focussed, the
advantages of this scientific design are lost; it is, therefore, essen-
tial that the filament should be approximately at the focus point
of the reflector.
In order to arrange this, the lamp holder is provided with three
notches, so that, by trying the bulb in the alternative positions, it
can be placed as near as possible to the correct focus.
The best way of focussing and setting the lamp is to take the
vehicle on to a straight, level road, and try the bulb in each of the
notches until the best road illumination is obtained.
Sidelamp Type C250
This lamp is similar in construction to the C50 type of head-
lamp, and the methods for removing the lamp front, wiring, and
focussing are exactly the same.

Care of the Lamps
It is well known that the efficiency of a lamp depends not only
on the shape of the reflector, but on its surface.
When the lamp
is used under normal conditions, it is not advisable to polish the
reflector.
Should it become tarnished it can be repolished with a
good chamois leather and finely-divided rouge moistened with petrol,
but on no account use any metal polishes.
When replacing a
bulb, removing or refitting a reflector, care should be taken not to
touch the polished surface with the fingers.
