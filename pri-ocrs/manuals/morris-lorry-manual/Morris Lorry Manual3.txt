Starting Up
It is advisable to turn over the engine by hand for two or three
revolutions before using the starter, as this makes the work which
the starter is called upon to do very much lighter; this is especially
so in cold weather.

Clutch
Except for gear changing, the greatest care should be taken never
to slip the clutch.
When adjusting the clutch pedal care must be exercised to ensure
that the stop which limits the backward movement of the clutch pedal
is placed so that the clutch can engage fully, otherwise slipping will
occur which will probably damage the clutch.
It is important to note that the clutch pedal slot in the floor board
must be of sufficient length to enable the pedal to come against the
stop provided.

Overall Chain
The overall chains are to be used only under extremely bad going.
General
It should be clearly understood that when driving on the emergency
gears the engine speed for a small road speed is very high.
Thus with
Ist speed in low ratio when the engine is running at 3000 r.p.m. the
road speed is only 3} m.p.h.
Care must therefore be taken not to
overdrive the vehicle when using the emergency gears.
