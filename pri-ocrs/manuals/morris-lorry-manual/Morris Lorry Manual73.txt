it will
be found that the other two are at the bottom
of their
cylinders.
Stuff these "open" cylinders with clean rag and with
a screwdriver or with a carpenter's chisel that has been suitably
blunted at its end so that it still has a bevelled appearance but has
actually no cutting edge, scrape all the black deposit oft the top
of the pistons, and also, using a smaller screwdriver as a scraper,
going carefully round the valve heads so that the top surface of
the cylinder block and the tops of the pistons have a bright, clean
appearance free from any trace of carbon. Do not endeavour to
polish things up with emery paper; it will do far more harm than
good. Then when two cylinders have been properly cleaned give
the starting handle half a turn and start on the other two.
This article is mainly on decarbonising, but, as we have said,
once the cylinder head is off it is quite appropriate for the valves
to be removed and ground in.
And this is how to get the valves
out.
The plate underneath the exhaust manifold on the near-side
of the engine should be taken off by undoing the nuts that hold it

springs and stems. The way
in which a Morris-Commercial
spring is fixed is best seen by
reference to one of the illus-
trations in these pages, which
shows that there is a circular
groove in the stem of the valve
into which fits a small horseshoe
cotter.
The
circular valve
collar rests on the cotter, and
of course, the bottom turn of
the spring presses down on the
collar, the top
turn bearing
against the cylinder casting.
Therefore,
to
remove
a
Morris-Commercial valve some
form of lever should first be
placed underneath the valve
collar and, with one hand held
on top of the valve head to
prevent it lifting,
and the
other one pressing down on the
lever, which should be suitably
Above are shown the component parts of the
Morris Commercial valve.
