Driving Axles
It is of utmost importance that the correct level of lubricant
and the correct type of lubricant be used in the driving axles.
There is no better form of transmission than the worm drive,
provided it is properly treated, but neglect may lead to loss of
power, bad running and other evils. On each back axle casing
The position of the oil gun nipple on the steering box.
will be found four plugs.
The uppermost of these is situated on
the square casing that contains the worm.
When tilling up the
main casing a small quantity of oil should be poured in through
this orifice to ensure thrust bearing lubrication.
The combined
filling plug and breather— the nipple-shaped plug in the illustration
—is the oil-filling orifice, the next lower down is the level inspection
plug, and the square-headed plug at the very bottom is the drain
plug. We recommend "Golden Shell" Oil, Adcol "N.P.5,
" or Gargoyle
Mobiloil "B" for back axle lubrication.
To hill up, the three top
plugs should be removed, and oil poured into upper holes until it
begins to issue from the lower orifice (the vehicle standing on level
ground). The three plugs should then be replaced
Front Hub Bearinés
The front hub bearings are lubricated by removing the hub cap,
which should be completely filled with grease and screwed home
again.
By this method the lubricant is forced through the six
holes in the bearing retaining washer, shown on page 27, into the
bearings themselves.
