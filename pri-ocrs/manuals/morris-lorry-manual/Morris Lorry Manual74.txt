enables the valve to be lifted right out of the cylinder.
Full instructions for grinding in valves are given in another
section, but in passing it may be said that after using valve-grinding
compound the top of the cylinder block and valve ports should be
thoroughly well swilled out with paraffin, and it is important to
see that none of the grinding compound finds its way on to the
working surfaces of the cylinders and pistons. Additionally, if
the valves are ground in, the tappets should be reset afterwards
to give 4/1000ths of an inch clearance (the thickness of the paper
on which these words are printed) to allow for the valves bedding
themselves down after grinding.
This information, be it noted,
will be thoroughly amplified in a later article.

The head should next come in for
attention, and with the same flat scraping tool all the black deposit
should be removed, particular care being taken to see that it is
shifted from around the part which goes over the valvesâ€” that is,
the deepest part of the cylinder head.
When using the scraper
take great care not to scratch the surface of the cylinder head
joint, otherwise gas leaks may set in at a later date.
