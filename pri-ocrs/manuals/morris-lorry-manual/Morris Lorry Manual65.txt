essential to remind the user that the successful use of them depends
to a large extent upon the equal and correct inflation of the tyres
upon the twin driving wheels
No hard and fast rule can be made
as to the exact pressure to be used in each tyre, but in general use
it will be found that tyre pressures in the neighbourhood of 5o to
6o lb. will give the most satisfactory results.
The one important
point to be watched is that the tyre pressures are not so low that
the flattening of the tyres when the vehicle is loaded reduces the

space between the adjacent walls of the twin tyres to such an
extent that the tongue on the track shoes fits tightly between.
Provision has been made for adequate clearance at this point, even
should one of the tyres accidentally become deflated.
Spacing of Twin Wheels
Two packing discs are fitted between the twin wheel discs, each
of approximately 1 in. in thickness, and it is important that these
discs are always correctly replaced between the two wheels after
anv removal or change of wheels.
Fitting of Tracks
It is to be presumed that in most cases where the use of tracks
is necessary, the driver of the vehicle will have some knowledge
