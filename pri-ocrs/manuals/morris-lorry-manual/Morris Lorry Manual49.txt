centre-zero instrument is provided, so that the driver can see
at a glance whether the dynamo is giving suficient output to keep
the battery charged in accordance with
the load
This type of
meter shows the actual current flowing into or from the battery ;
if, therefore, the lamps are switched on and take 6 amperes, and
the dynamo is generating & amperes, the meter shows 2 amperes
in the charge direction, this being the current in excess of that
consumed by the lamps which is available for charging purposes.
It should be noted that the current for the starter motor and
for the internal lights is taken directly from the battery, and
consequently this load is not indicated by the ammeter.

Fuse
A fuse is inserted in the dynamo shunt circuit to prevent damage
to the dynamo windings if the battery becomes disconnected
through any cause.
Occasionally examine the switchbox in order
to ascertain that the two fuse wire securing screws "G" (Fig. 6)
are tight, and that the fuse holder is held firmly in position by the
fuse posts.
