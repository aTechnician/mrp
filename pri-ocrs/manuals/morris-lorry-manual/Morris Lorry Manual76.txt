HERE are only two really important things that the owner-
T driver has to do to keep a Morris-Commercial engine in good
condition during its normal life.
One is to decarbonise it
and the other is to grind in the valves.
The valves of the Morris-Commercial Truck are of what are known
as the side-by-side type, and they are situated on the near-side of
the engine; that is, the left-hand side, looking forward. Underneath
the round long-finned projection from the top of the engine on
this side (the exhaust collector) will be found two long flat plates
covering the whole length of the engine, with one nut on each.
Removal of these nuts allows the plates to be detached, and exposes
to view the valve springs, each of which is located above what is
known as a tappet.
The tappet has three nuts on it, which are for

adjustment. The springs surround the valve stem, their upper ends
bearing on the casting of the cylinder, and their lower ends on a
collar or plate with a hole through it, which, in turn, presses against
a little horseshoe cotter, which fits into a groove cut in the pencil-
like stem of the valve.
Removal of the cylinder head (see article on decarbonisation)
discloses on the left-hand side of the engine the valve heads, and
in no matter what position the pistons may be, according to how
the engine has stopped on switching off, one or more valves will
be raised, which shows that a valve consists of a round, flat head
attached to a thin pencil-like stem, the whole being rather like an
elongated and decidedly tough mushroom.
