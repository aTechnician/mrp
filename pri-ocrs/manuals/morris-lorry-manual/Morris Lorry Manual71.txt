First of all jet tippieine run until it has warmed up, and then,
open the drain plug found on the bottom
near-side of the radiator and let the water drain away either into a
bucket or down a drain, or any way arrange so that a sloppy
puddle is not made in which one has to stand to work.
The order in which the cylinder head holding-down bolts
should be loosened and tightened up is as above.
While the radiator is draining, the two bonnet sides should be
removed and one of the top halves of the bonnet folded back so
as to give absolute freedom and a good light whilst working.
When decarbonising the Morris-Commercial engine there is no
need to touch anything but the cylinder head; it is not even
necessary to turn off the petrol. First of all the magneto leads to
the plugs should be disconnected and the nuts of the water pipe
clips
should
be undone, and when the two
water
clips
are loosened it will be
found that the rubber connecting
hose can be slipped upwards, thus enabling the head when
loosened to be lifted straight off. The sparking plugs should
be left in position and, starting with the centre nut and
working in the order shown in the accompanying illustration,
each of the cylinder head bolts should be slackened back a
quarter of a turn only with the long
handled box spanner
that is provided in the kit.
It is not advisable to take off
bolts completely one at a time,
as this mav set up
strains and stresses in
the middle of the cylinder head
When all the bolts have been eased, however, the one that
was first cased can be removed entirely, and it will be found
that force or violence is absolutely unnecessary to remove
any of the bolts, as the threads are properly made. The bolts
should be carefully put in a box so that they do not roll about and
