should be
turning both of the wheels, that the braking
effect on them is equal.
After these have been adjusted and equalised
disconnect 2A (see diagram), taking care not to alter the link adjust-
ment, and equalise IA and 3A.
Then disconnect IA and 3A and
connect and equalise 2A and 4A, afterwards re-connecting all links
and making final adjustments for running clearance by means of
the turnbuckle between the cross shaft and the servo mechanism.
A similar procedure should be followed when equalising the hand
brake adjustments,
commencing with IB and
2B only connected
while being equalised, and proceeding by disconnecting 2B and con-
necting iB and 3B as in the case of the foot brake.
Final adjustment
for running clearance will then be made by means of the turnbuckle
between the lower end of the hand brake lever and the brake cross
shaft.
The above description may seem to the reader to be lengthy and
complicated, but it will be found that, in order to ensure equal adjust-
ment and consequent equal life of the brake-shoes, it is well worth
carrying out methodically, as it will probably save time in the end
