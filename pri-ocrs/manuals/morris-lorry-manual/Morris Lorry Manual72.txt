If this is not so, however, there will be found in eacl corner
of the cylinder head a small lug or projection.

and then at the front on the two lugs on the near-side of the power
unit.
At the same time extra upward pressure can be obtained by
putting one's fingers through the top water oritice and pulling
upwards. On no account should a screwdriver or a chisel or any
other sharp pointed tool be used as a wedge between the cylinder
block and the head, otherwise the gasket will be spoiled
and a
proper watertight joint will not be made on reassembling.
Easing the head off the block is by no means a difficult matter,
and once it has been freed it should be lifted straight off and care-
fully laid on a bench, the sparking plugs being removed so that no
carbon drops into their interiors during subsequent operations.
Lifting the head will expose the pistons and the valves to view,
but before anthing else is done the gasket -that is the copper
asbestos washer which makes a gas- and water-tight joint between
the cylinder head and the block-should carefully be removed
