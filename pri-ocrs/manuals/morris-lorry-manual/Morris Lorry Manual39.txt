If, when the contact points are examined, it is found that they
are burned or blackened, they may be cleaned with very fine emery
cloth, and afterwards with a cloth moistened with petrol. Care
must be taken that all particles of dirt and metal dust are wiped
away.
To render the points accessible for cleaning, it is necessary
to withdraw the contact breaker from its housing by unscrewing
the hexagon-headed bolt "G" with the magneto spanner.
The
whole contact breaker can then be pulled off the tapered shaft
on which it fits.
Now push aside the locating spring.
"H," prise
the rocker-arm off its bearings, and it will be possible to begin
cleaning the points.
When replacing
the contact breaker, care should be taken to
ensure that the projecting key on the tapered portion of the con-
tact breaker base engages with the keyway cut in the armature
spindle, or the whole timing of the magneto will be upset. The
hexagon-headed bolt should be tightened up with care; it must
be neither too slack, nor must undue force be used.
