A driver is
usually advised to keep mis timing lever auvancea
retarding it only when necessary; eg. for starting and for hill
chmbing:
This is sound advice,
for it not only enables more
power to be developed and petrol economised, but the magneto is
relieved of much strain.
Lubrication
Magnetos are fitted with ball bearings on the driving shaft; these
bearings are packed with grease before leaving the Works, and do
not require oiling.
The distributor gear bearing should be lubri-
cated every 1000 miles by adding about three drops of good quality
thin machine oil at the lubricating cap.
The reader is cautioned
that far more trouble has been caused by excessive oiling than
by too little.
Provision is made for oiling the cam-ring in order to reduce
fibre heel wear; in consequence the magneto is able to give longer
periods of service without the need for altering the setting of the
contact points.
The oiling arrangement consists of a pocket in
the contact breaker housing containing a length of felt soaked in
oil.
A small hole in the cam-ring tilled with wick is provided to
enable the oil to find its way on to the surface of the ring. About
every 5000 miles the cam-ring should be withdrawn and a few
drops of thin machine oil placed on the felt.
Fitting High-Tension Cables
Concealed terminals are provided in
the distributor
for fitting the high-
tension cables. To fit a cable it should
not be bared, but cut off to the required
length.
Removing the distributor and un-
screwing the pointed screws,
shown
at "B" (Fig. 3). push the cable "A"
hard home.
Replace and tighten up
the screw, which will then pierce the
insulation and make contact with the

cable core, and the distributor can
be finally replaced.
NOTE.-Use only seven-millimetre diameter cable. Do not
attempt to use a thicker cable pared down to fit.
