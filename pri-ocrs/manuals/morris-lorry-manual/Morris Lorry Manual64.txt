The Use of Tracks
The overall track has been designed and is intended for use when
the vehicle is required to operate under conditions which are so
severe that the driving wheels will slip, due either to the muddy
nature of the ground, the excessive gradient, or to the fact that
the ground is too soft to carry the weight of the vehicle without
excessive sinkage and its consequent need for high tractive effort.
In this case the fitting of the tracks materially increases the area
of ground upon which the load is carried, thereby reducing possible
sinkage to a considerable extent. The tracks are not intended for
continued use on good hard road surfaces and at a high rate of
speed.
It will be realised that any conditions which necessitate
the use of tracks to obtain sufficient wheel adhesion or support, at
the same time render travelling at a high speed impossible.
The
tracks have, therefore, been kept as simple as possible in construc-
tion, and the manipulation of them has been arranged so that the
work of fitting, removing and stowing away can be quickly per-
formed by one man.
