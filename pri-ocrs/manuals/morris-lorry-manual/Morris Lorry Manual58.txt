The Fitting, Removal and Care
of Straight Side Cord Tyres
•HE Morris-Commercial Six-wheeled Truck is equipped with
T Dunlop Straight Side a a wheeled 3uck is quip, a vịth
single tyres on the front wheels and twins on all four driving
wheels.
It is important to note that the tyres are not of the more generally
known beaded edge type, but wired on type, that is, having inex-
tensible wire edges.
These edges having a smaller circumference
than the overall of the rim, they cannot be brought over the rim
edge by means of tyre leverage, which should never be resorted to.
The removal
and fitting operations are extremely simple,
that is necessary in order to draw the tyres off their rims being
the removal of the detachable spring flange. The operations in
detail are given below.
Removal
lever provided (ris. t, piness the he all which will be the special
one end of this flange.
A downward thrust of the lever will then bring a portion of
the flange out of the rim groove, enabling the whole to be easily
whipped
off by hand.
All that is necessary now is to clear the valve stem of the rim
hole and to draw the tyre complete off its rim.
Fitting
To fit the tyre insert the tube (slightly inflated), and the flap
in the cover.
Apply the complete tyre to the rim, taking care
that the valve comes truly through the valve hole.
Insert one end of the detachable flange in the rim groove
diametrically opposite the valve hole, and push down by hand
as far as it will go. The longer lip "B" of the broad end of the
lever should then be inserted in the rim recess at a position
rather more than half-way round the flange circumference from
the inserted end, in such a way that the shorter lip "C" engages
the flange.
By means of leverage the flange is then expanded and forced
towards the tyre until in contraction it finds its way into the rim
recess around practically the whole of its circumference.
After making sure that to this point its base is firmly seated
