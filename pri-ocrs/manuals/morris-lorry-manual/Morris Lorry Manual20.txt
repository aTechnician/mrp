casing off at the same time the screws in this bracket which clamp
it to the column itself.
The steady bracket, and with it the steering
post, can now be lowered or raised one notch on the instrument
plate, which alters the steering column angle accordingly.
The
column should now be securely locked in position again.
A complete worm wheel is provided, and may be set in either
of two positions.
Should the steering wheel show an excessive
amount of play, all the connections between the steering-gear box
and the front axle should be examined to detect looseness. If
no looseness is apparent, there is probably some wear in the
steering worm wheel, which should be turned go degrees to a new
position.
If the steering lever is removed, the worm wheel can be
turned through go degrees by rotating the steering wheel, and the
lever put on in the new position.
Driving Axles
There
are no adjustments of any kind that can be made to
the gearing of the driving axles, as all parts are correctly set on

The hub covers should occasionally be
removed to give access to the lubricators fitted in the ends of
axle shafts for the purpose of lubricating the hub bearings.
