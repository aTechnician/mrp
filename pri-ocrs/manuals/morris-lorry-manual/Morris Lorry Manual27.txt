THE oil supply is carried in the sump of the bottom case.
T To the side of the top case an oil level indicator rod is fitted,
which is graduated at its lower end. By drawing the indicator
rod out the quantity of oil in the sump can be read off from where
the oil adheres to the rod. When the oil level reaches the top
mark on the rod the sump contains if gallons approximately.
The
oil should never be allowed to fall below the half mark.

of its construction and the lubricating system.
In checking the quantity of oil in the sump, the rod should be
withdrawn, wiped clean and reinserted before taking the reading.
Owing to the surging and splashing of the oil when the engine and
truck are in motion, an accurate reading is not otherwise possible.
