of travel of the vehicle, because any attempt on their part to
deviate from a straight course, will result in rapid tread wear,
as also will any play or wobble there may be, due to looseness or
worn bearings.
Clearances
See that there is no contact between the tyres whilst rotating
and any part of the vehicle, especially (when the springs are
in a state of depression under excessive load) any projection from
Contact of this kind will result in circumferential
cutting of the tyre at the point of engagement, sometimes penetrat-
ing completely through the rubber and many-if not all-of the
casing plies.
Users of Dunlop tyres are entitled to satisfaction, and they
will certainly get it provided the tyres are reasonably treated.
To reiterate, watch the inflation pressure carefully.
The necessity
for so doing will be appreciated when it is realised, as is the case,
that fully 90% of tyre troubles are attributable in some degree
to inadequate inflation pressure.
