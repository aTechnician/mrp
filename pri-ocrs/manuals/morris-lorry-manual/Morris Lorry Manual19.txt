After having
removed the evlinder head three or four
times, a new gasket should be fitted.
Before litting a new gasket
examine it to see that it is uniform in thickness, otherwise it may
prove impossible to make a satisfactory watertight joint.

Clutch
The clutch fitted to the Morris-Commercial 15.9 hop. engine is of
the single dry-plate type, the plate being gripped between two bonded
asbestos fabric dises, one of which is secured to the llywhcel and
the other to the sliding member.
Eight driving pins pass through
the flywheel and the sliding member carrying eight compression
springs which provide the necessary pressure between the friction
members. To release the clutch a sestem of levers operates against
a ball thrust bearing mounted on the sliding member, so that when
the clutch pedal is depressed the sliding member is drawn along
the shaft, compressing the springs and releasing the friction plate
The end pressure on the crankshaft, which is set up at this instant
is taken on a ball thrust bearing, mounted at the forward end
When the clutch is in, no end pressure is exerted on the crankshaft
whatever.
It is most important that this clutch should be kept dry, and
special oll-retaming devices are Incorporated to prevent oil passing
rom either engine or gearbox into the clutch housing
Never
continually rest the toot on the clutch pedal, as this is hable to
cause a certain amount of slipping, and, in any case, persistent
slipping should not be resorted to, as this will gradually reduce
the efficiency of the clutch.
Steering Gear
If the steering column shaft shows signs of end play, this may
be corrected by slackening back the lock nut and giving the adjust-
