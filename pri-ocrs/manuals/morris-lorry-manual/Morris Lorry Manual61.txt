General Instructions Relating to the Care and Maintenance
of Tyres
Dunlop Straight Side tyres need little in the way of attention
apart from the all-important matter of seeing that they are properly
inflated to meet the load conditions which apply.
Fig. 1. The special tyre lever used for the fitting and removal
of straight side cord tyres.
If the contained air in a pneumatic tyre is not maintained
to that degree upon which the successful functioning of the tyre
depends, curtailment of tyre life is bound to result.
In determining what is correct pressure, the axle weights,
when the vehicle is carrying maximum load, need to be known. The
only reliable method of arriving at these weights is to weigh the
front and rear axles separately when the vehicle is fully loaded
It is not sufficient to inflate tyres to the required pressure
and -then neglect the matter. Periodical testing by means of
a gauge applied to the valve is essential. It is mere waste of
time to endeavour to judge from the appearance of tores whether
they are properly inflated or not. as unless the degree of under-
inflation is serious, no appreciable bulging, even to a practised eve,
is noticeable.
Thus, when a tyre does bulge it is probable that
the pressure is somewhere about half that necessary to meet the
load conditions.
Therefore, if this state has been reached as a
result of gradually falling pressure, it will be readily appreciated
that a tyre may have done many hundreds of miles in a more or
less inadequately inflated condition.
The effect of under-inflation is to permit that undue flexing
or hinging of the tyre walls which, owing to internal friction,
destroys the adhesion between the casing plies and leads to
eventual fracture at the position of the hinging.
It also renders
tyres more vulnerable to puncturing implements encountered in
running, and to concussion fractures.
