alone.
It is a peculiarity of human nature that a costly article-be it
a motor tyre or a gold wrist-watch
-is treated with more respect
by the owner than a less expensive article, such as a sparking plug
or a fifteen shilling alarm clock.
Therefore, it is not surprising
that the plugs fitted in the majority of engines receive little or
no attention,
while more expensive components are carefully
adjusted and kept in good condition.
Loss of Tune
It is not generally realised that sooty or oiled-up plugs will
cause erratic
running,
loss of power and,
most serious
all,
increased petrol
consumption.
Unless an intense spark
takes
place between the plug points in the cylinder, complete combustion
of the petrol mixture will not take place,
and a certain amount
of petrol vapour will be wasted with every revolution of the engine.
If the plug points are covered with oil, or if the plug itself is choked
with carbon deposit, it will be impossible to obtain a good spark
in the cylinder.
When the sparking plug is in this condition it can easily be
cleaned by immersing it completely in paraffin for a few hours,
and then
brushing
the carbon deposit away with a stiff brush.
