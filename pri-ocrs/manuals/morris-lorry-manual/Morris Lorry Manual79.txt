If the valve-lifting tool shown on page 71 is use

How to grind in the valves with the aid of the special tool which can be obtained from
Messrs. Morris-Commercial Cars Lid. for the sum of 1s. 8d.
After valve-grinding it is always necessary to reset the tappets.
It is done by using the three nuts on the top of the tappets, the
centre one of which is a lock nut, which should be undone first,
and then the top nut should be screwed relative to the bottom
one until the piece of paper on which these words are printed
can just be pushed between the stem of the valve and the tappet
-just, and just only.
Resetting the tappets is necessary, because the valve-head will
have been ground down farther into the seating, thus reducing
the clearance, and, if the valve is held off its seating, the flaming
gases will destroy the faces, absolutely undoing all the good work
of valve-grinding.
The operations described above should not take an average
handy-man more than about six hours, including decarbonising
the engine as previously described
