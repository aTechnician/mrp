Points in Plug Design
The plugs as fitted to the Morris-Commercial Six-wheeled Trucks
were only
adopted after exhaustive tests; there is no advantage,
therefore, in fitting new ones of some other type.
This brings up an
interesting question which motorists repeatedly ask why will a
The answer is that in designing a plug
two features
must be considered; firstly, the amount of heat, and secondly the
amount of oil, which it will have to withstand.
These two features
are invariably at opposite ends of the scale; thus we find that a
plug suitable for a racing car will have to be proof against extra-
ordinarily high temperatures, but at the same time it will not be
required to function in a particularly oily atmosphere.
On the
other hand, in a touring car used under ordinary touring conditions
the plug will seldom get exceptionally hot, but will be subjected
to an unusual amount of oil.
The whole secret, then, is to choose
a plug which will get just hot enough to keep itself clean and yet
not hot enough to pre-ignite.
Now, the principal factor in obtaining this result is the amount
of gas space available inside the plug. A plug built to withstand
an exceptional amount of heat will not stand oil, and vice versa.
Therefore, rely on the maker's choice.
