of excessive steepness or extremely soft ground, and that he will
be able to select a piece of ground whereon the track can be laid
out to its full extent as shown in figure 1, and the vehicle reversed
over the track until the wheels are
along its length so that
the ends can be brought over to the position shown in figure 2,
for the convenient
application of
the track tensioner
which
is
supplied as part of the tool outfit.

The track should then be tightened until the joint pin can be in-
serted in one of the adjustment holes in the manner shown in figure 3.
The amount of tension required on the track will be decided by the
conditions encountered.
If the
ground is wet, slippery mud, it
will be found necessary to tension the track moderately tight in
order to obtain sufficient adhesion between the tyres and the track
shoes.
If. on the
other hand, the going is dry, sufficient driving
effect will be obtained with the track fitted quite loosely.
The
joint pin should then be securely cottered as shown in figure 4, and
the track is then ready for use as in figure 5.
