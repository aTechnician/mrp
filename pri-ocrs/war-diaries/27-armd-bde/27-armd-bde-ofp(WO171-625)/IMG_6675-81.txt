allocation by Ord 21

causing confusion and were no longer required.

spares and Assemblies as they will accept to all Ord
Id Pks and other Units of 2 Army Have still a large number left for disposal.
Asked DADOS A.R.G. for authority to send these to l4 A.O.D. since dispatch to
17 R.S.D. will probably mean that they would remin there for some time,
unused. Was told by DADOS that they'would have to go to 17 R.S.D. as 14 A.O. D.
could not accept them.
