SECRET.
MATER-COMN (Cont)
15.
SECURIL reloss will only be used for the move from
the present
location if
vitally necessary.
It will
be improssed on all
Crow
Comds that use of wireless during such a move
is
indicative of one thing only
an impending attack.
27 Arma Bde and this Rogiment in particular have
acquired a reputation for vory bad security!
In addition
to
the fact that l Corps are intending to monitor our net during
this oporation, bad
security
and
too much
use of wireloss may
load to unnecessary casualtios and even failure of the
opcration.
Cortain information
awaited from Higher Authority
concorning this operation is
still
and hes not yot been recoived.
If and when rocoived in time this will be sent out.
