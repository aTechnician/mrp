A further attack was made on our own tes by Spitfires...
About 60 Inf were
killed and wounded and a Half-track belonging to the Arty Forward Observation
Officer was set on fire.
Slight damage was caused to one or two tanks.
but there were no casualties.
The attack was delayed by this strafing
but after reorganisation D Coy got across the river supported by fire
from the tanks.
The latter were engaged by a high velocity gun firing
HoF from the high ground across the river. It was impossible to locate
or identify this gun.
The remainder of the regt in the order A,C. HQ moved across the river to a
harbour area at 29251, where they were held in reserve at inmediate notice
should an armoured enemy counter-attack develop fron the South.
Orders were sent to '3' Sgn that at all costs a firm bridgehead must be
established across the river..
Recce was made by tos to the North and
South but no suitable crossing places were found.
During this recce
Lighings attacked our fid tos with cannon fire and two tanks were lifted
off the road by bombs.
There were, however, no casualties.
By this time
the light was becoming bad and it was decided impossible to effect a
crossing of the river for tanks that nighte
Lte GoR. BASFORD, Lt. D. JOSEPHS and Et. G.M. WIISON were posted to the
regt from 148 Regt R.1.C. and posted to A, C & Recce Ip respectively.
B Sqn moved into harbour at 432788.
Regtl A2 Echelon arrived with fuel, amn., mail and yellow smoke.

and in the morning only five tanks were found to be in a mechanically
sound condition:
2 and 4 Ips went forward to the support pons of the night before.
Further
orders were given to cross the river but vivilian information revealed
that no tank crossings were possible.
The tanks were again engaged by the
enemy gun from the wish ground aeross the river but no casulties vere suffered.
