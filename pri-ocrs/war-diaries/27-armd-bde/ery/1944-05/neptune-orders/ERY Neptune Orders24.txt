GENERAL.
The area over which 3 3r Inf Div will operate is for the most part
The country is almost entirely arable (strip cultivation)
and the contours are gentle, rising to about 250' near ANGUERNY OTTO
Woods and orchards are found in valleys and round villages,
the terrain is very open and bare,
and ground will supply what littlo
cover there is.
Roads are narrow by Inglish standards, barks and ditches
being the rule rather than hedges.
South of CAN the going is good as
• far as TRETTEVITLE SUR LAIZE 0553.
INUNDATIONS.
(1)
he marshy Area irmediately behind QUER, RED are shown in detai
At the present date,
18 May L4) the area o
waterlogged. land has docreased a preciably and the ground in
becoming firmer.
It is considered that these areas may be
artificially flooded at any time.
If that is so, tanks will be
forced out to the right and will have to make their exit fron tho
beach in the vicinity of rd june 080309-
the gap between th
wo areas of inundation is spanned our by an 3r road. which i.
Planked on one side by a 15% dyke and on the other by a marsh,
(ii) The strip of ground ("liable to flood) lying in the R ORNE
valley (North of CAHN) Mand between R OPNE and CAN CANAL is bad
going even in dry weather.
The whole area is criss-crossed
with 4'/5' dykes.
NATURAT, ODSTACLES.
A wooded ravine of considerable depth runs in an EASTERLY direction
from incl Wood 044730 to its point of junction with the CAEN CANAL
at approx 074723.
A tranch of this obstacle runs North from 058723
for approx 4,000 yas at which point it turns westwards, until, near
PARIERS SUR IE DAN 0476, it ceases to be an obstacle.
The ravine
has steep and thickly wooded sides - its bed is marshy.
Trace "R"
shows possible crossing places and the full extent of the obstacle.
A = a narrow steep crossing involving a novement for about 100 yds
along the bed of the obstacle.
3 = probably the best crossing, but it cuts across the corner of
a morsh.
C= a possible crossing between woods - the marsh will have to be
traversed.
D = crossing FAST and WEST over the NORIH branch of the obstacle -
novement off the road inadvisable. Classification
of Irs at 063742 unknown.
