This Instr is designed to cover certain alternative tasks which 9 Br
Inf ide Gp may be ardered
to carry out if the op envisaged in 9 Br Inf Ide
Gp 0 0 No 1 dated 21 May 44 beaomes impractical.
Every effort is being made to provide up to date infm about the
dispositions, strength, movement and intentions of GERMAN forces which nay
confront 3 Br Inf Div on D day.
It follows that some factors must remain
almost incaloulable until the enery is met on D day.
The alternative tasks which my confront 9 In Inf Ide on lag are
manifold - thir Inste deals only with
the more likely ones.
enumerated below will be put into execution ei ther
(a) after rease on the ground, or
(b) issue of orders at Cond's 'or Gp, or
(o) issue of orders by Io.
APPRECIATION,
Courses
most likely to prevent 9 Br Inf Ide Gp
carrying out the role
allotted to it in 9 Br Inf Ide 0 O No. I dated 21 May 44 can be sumrised thus.-.
(a) 8 Can Int Bde has the task of landing on NAN Seotor and capturing
ANGUERNY 0177 - 5z miles inland.
Conourrent with
this op, 4 SS Bde (less one Commando) and one
Conmando from 1 SS ide have the
task of ldg on NAN and QUEEN Sectors
turning EAST and WEST and clearing LANGRUNE SUR-MER 0285
and LUC-SUR-MER 0482.
It is not expected that these ops will be
sucoessfully carried through before H + 4 hrs.
4 Ss Bde has a subsequent task of clearing DOUVRES 0180.
Should enery resistance from the high ground BASY 9979 -
ANGUERNY prove strong enough to delay the adv of 8 Cän Inf 3do,
9 In Inf ide may well have to capture ANGUARNY:-
(i) to relieve pressure on 3 Can Inf 3de,
(i1) to deny enery observation on to the beaches,
(111) to proteot its own ady fud to ST CONTEST.
This will be known as PLAN IX'
(b)
If 3 Can Inf Div ops proceed to plan, the adv of 9 Br Inf Bde from
its cono area PLUMETOl 0478 to its final objeotive, inol SI CONTEST -
exal COUVRE CHEF 0271 may well succeed.
Should 185 Inf Bde meet with deternined opposition at the a tk aitoh
SOUTH of BIEVILLE 0574 and/or be seriously interfered with by the fire
of eneny OPs directed from the high ground EAST of R ORNE, 9 Br Inf
Bde may be ordered to capture CAEN in its plaoe.
This will be known as PLAN "Y'
Should 9 Br Inf Bde Gp be landed on either PETER, QUERN/GREEN O ROGER
Seotors,
the plan will not mterially be affected.
At worst, a new:
assembly area may have to be chosen
9 Br Inf Bde Go will still cono at PLUMETOI.
