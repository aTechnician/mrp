Steel Rail. Obstacles.
These have been located at Beach Dict 26
There is no evidence of their existence elsewhere in the irmodiate
beachhead or furthur inland.
Obstacles below Hich fide
Marko
Obstacles have now been
erected right amoss
the Front of QUEEN WHITE and QUEEN RED -
exact details are set out in 3 In Inf Div Triefing Intelligenca
Sumary.
Assing that H Hour is at high water' • 3 ls,
these
obstacles should be clearly visible to DD
tanks,
They wil
sumerge in succession from High Water - 2 hrs.
The timber
"marm" type obstacles are of substantial construction (1' timber
polest and night well "belly" a swirming
tank.
The stakes (of
similor thickness) are not swh a serious proposition
There is
always the possibility that these obstacles and the gap between
them may be minod,

(3)
Sections of ditch at irregular intervals from incl Cross Rds
993730 to inci. 069713 - width 15'.
The latter is of i mediate
tactical significance because it affects the battle for CAm.
This ditch has only been construsted within the last few months;
but since the beginning of April, only 150% have been addede
Sections are sited to cover the principal roads leading into OAN
from N and NW,
but there is yet no evidence of nines being laid in
conjunction with this work,
in fact, very litilo cvidonou
defence of CAEN.
nti-lank Arty
Apart from the beach defences themselves and
ortain unlocated posns in the NW distriat of CAEN (ground reporte
nly), all Arty within the Div area has been primarily sited either
or a coastal defence, Fa or AA Role.
The A Tk guns in the beach
defences (with the exception noted below) and at the RANVILLE Tridge
104745 are probably less
than 50 m calibre (0.47 mn) - the size of
the A Tk weapons in CAM is not known.

sections
In addition, it should
be noted that all enemy suns of Fa calibre (105 mm and below) are capable
of engaging Tanks at short ranges with A.P. or hollow charge amn. Light
Flak posns are probably equipped with the 20 m super-hy MoG. which has a f
good A Tk performance at ranges under 400 yas.
