CHINERAL.
The area over which 3 Ir Inf Div will operate is for the most part
good going.
The country is alrost entirely arable (strip cultivation)
and the contours are gentle, rising to about 250' noor ANGURANY 0I77O
Woods and orchards are found in valleys and round villages, elsevere
he terrain is very open and bare, and ground will supply what little
cover there is. Roads are narrow by English standards, barks and diiches
being the rule rather than hedges.
South of CAH the going is good as
far as IRETIEVITLE SUR LAIZE 0553.

The marshy Area irmediately behind QUEET, RED are shown in detail
At the present date,
waterlogged land has docreased appreciably and the ground is
It is considered that these areas may to
artificially flooded at any
forced out to the right and will have to make their exit from tho
beach in the vicinity of ra juno 030309.
wo areas of inundation is spanned only by an 31 road, which is
Planked on one side by a 15' dyke and on the other by a marsh,
(ii) The strip of ground ("liable to flood) lying in the R ORNE
valley (North of CAM) Mand between R ORNE and CAEN CANAL is bad
going even in dry weather.
The whole area is criss-crossed
with 41/5% dykes.
NAVURAT, OUSTACLES.
A wooded ravine of considerable depth runs in an EASTERLY direction
from incl Wood 044730 to its point of junction with
the CARN CANAL
at approx 074723.
A tranch of this obstacle runs North from 058728
for approx 4,000 yas at which point it turns westwards, until, near
PHRIERS SUR IE DAN 0476, it ceases to be an obstacle.
The ravine
has steep and thickly wooded sides e its bed is marshy.
Trace "R"
shows possible crossing places and the full extent of
the obstacle.
A = a narrow steep crossing involving a novement for about 100 yds
along the bed of the obstacle.
B = probably the best crossing, but it cuts across the corner of
a morsh.
C = a possible crossing between woods - the marsh will have to be
traversed.
D = crossing EAST and WEST over
the NORIH branch of the obstacle -
movement off the road inadvisable. Classification
of Irs at 063742 unknown.
