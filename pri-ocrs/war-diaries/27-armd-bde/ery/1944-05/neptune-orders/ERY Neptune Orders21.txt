(a) Mechanised Formations in Counter-attack Role.
(1) 12 SS Pa. Div (Hitler Jugend).
This Div differs fron a normal Panzer Div in the following respects:-
Tank Regt has two PANZER Ins, one TIGER In and one Assault Gun In
instead of three
tank Ins.
The two Grenadier Regiments consist of
three bns each instead of two.
The type of Assault Gun, used by
12 SS Pz Div is almost certainly the long barrelled 75 rm (of the KWK
40 fitted to the Mark IV tank) mounted on a Mark III Chassis
reinforced with side-armour to sover the suspension.

(1)
There is some photographic evidenoe of minefields.
Mines can be laid
very quickly and it is safe
to assume that the
beach itself, beach exits and the roads in the beach head area
will be extensively mined on D day.
Inland, all wire defences
may contain mines and should be suspeat.
In partioular, attention is drawn to the following located
(11)
minefields :-
(1) on the beach in front of COD (I A BRECHE strongpoint 0880)•
Exaot limits not known.
2) Extensive minefields now surround the DAIMER strongpoint
1077•
These fields are as much as 190k and 140* in depth
to the North and South respectively.
These mines appear
to be outside the perimeter wire of the strong point.
(3) Strong point HITTINAN OTT is now protected by a four-row
mine belt inside the wire.
(4) A small minefield may exist on the beach opposite exit 26
(094804) approximate dimensions 150* by 40*
