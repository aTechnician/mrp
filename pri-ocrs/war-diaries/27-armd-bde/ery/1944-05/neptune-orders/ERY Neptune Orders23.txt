GENERAL®
The area over which 3 Ir Inf Div will operate is for the most part
good going.
The country is alnost entirely arable (strip cultivation)
and the contours are gentle, rising to about 250' near ANGUERNY CITIe
Woods and orchards are found in valleys and round villages,
elsewhere
the terrain is very open and bare,
and round will supply what little
cover there is.
Roads are narrow by English standards, barks and diiches
being the rule rather than hedges.
South of CAEN the going is good as
far as TRETTEVITLE SUR LAIZE 0553.

forced out to the right and will have to rake their exit fron tho
beach in the vicinity of rd june 080309s
The gap between the
two areas of inundation is spanned only by an 31 road, which is
flanked on one side by a 15' dyke and on the other by a marsh
(ii) The strip of ground ("liable to flood) lying in the R ORNE
valley (North of CAN) Mand between R ORNE and CAEN CANAL is bad
going even in dry weather,
The whole area is criss-crossed
with 4'/5: dykes.
NATURAL, OSSFACTES.
A wooded ravine of considerable depth runs in an EASTERLY direction
from inal Wood 044730 to its point of junction with the CAN CANAL
at approx 074723.
A tranch of this obstacle runs North from 058728
for approx 4,000 yas at which point it turns westwards, until, near
PERIERS SUR IN DAN 0476, it ceases to be an obstacle.
The ravine
has steep and thickly wooded sides its bed is marshy.
Trace "R"
shows possible crossing places and the full extent of the obstacle.
A = a murrow steep crossing involving a novement for about 100 yds
along the bed of the obstacle.
B = probably the best crossing, but it cuts across the corner of
a marsh.
C = a possible crossing between woods - the marsh will have to be
traversed.
D = crossing EAST and WEST over the NORTH branch of the obstacle -
movement off the road inadvisable. Classification
of Irs at 063742 unknown.
