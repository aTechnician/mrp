GENERAL.
This Inste is designed to cover certain alternative tasks which 9 Br
Inf Bde Gp
may be ardered
carry out if the op envisaged in 9 Br Inf Bde
Gp 0 0 No 1 dated 21 May 44 becomes impractical.
Every effort is being made to provide up to date infm about the
dispositions, strength, moverent and intentions of GERMAN forces which may
Inf Div on D day.
It follows that some faotors must remain
almost incaloulable until the enery is met on D day.
The alternative tasks which my confront 9 Ir Inf Dãe on lag are
manifold - thir Instr deals only with the more likely ones, The plans
enumerated below will be put into execution oi ther
(a) after roode on the ground, or

APPRECIATION,
Courses most likely to prevent 9 Br Inf Bde Gp
carrying out the rale
allotted to it in 9 Ir Inf 3ãe O O No. 1 dated 21 May 44 can be sumrised thus;-
(a) 8 Can Int ide has the task of landing on NAN Seotor and capturing
ANGUERNY 0177 - 5z miles inland.
Conourrent with this op, 4 SS Bde (less one Commando) and one
Commando from I SS ide have
the tosk of Idg on NAN and QUEEN Sectors
turning FAST and WEST and clearing LANGRUNE-SUR-MER 0283
It is not expected that these ops will be
sucoessfully carried through before H + 4 hrs.
4 ss ide has a subsequent task of clearing DOUVRES 0180.
Should enery resistance from the high ground BAStY 9979 -
ANGUERNY prove strong enough to delay the ady of 8 Can Inf 3de,
9 Ir Inf ide may well have to capture ANGUERNY: -
(1) to relieve pressure on 8 Can Inf Bde,
(ii) to deny enery observation on to the beaches,
(1i1) to proteot its own adv fwd to ST CONTEST.
This will be known as PLAN 'X!
(0)
If 3 Can Inf Div ops proceed to plan,
the adv of 9 Br Inf Bde from
1ts cono area PIUMETOT 0478 to its final objective, inol SI CONTIST -
xal COUVRE CHEF 0271 may well sucaced.
Shoula 135 Inf 3de meet with determined opposition at the a tk ditoh
SOUTH of BIEVILLE 0574 and/or be seriously interfered with by the fire
of enemy OPs directed from the high ground EAST of R ORNE, 9 Er Inf
Bde may be ordered to capture CAEN in its plaoe.
This will be known as PLAN "Y'
(o)
Should 9 Br Inf Ide Gp be landed on either PETER, QUEEN/GREAT Or ROGER
Seotors,
the plan will not materially be affected.
At worst, a new
asserbly area may have to be chosen.
9 Br Inf Bde Go will still cono at PLUMETOT.
