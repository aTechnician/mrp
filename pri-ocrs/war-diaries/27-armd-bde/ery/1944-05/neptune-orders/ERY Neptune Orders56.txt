ENEMY.
(a) Mechanised Forrations in Counter-attack Role.
(1) 12 SS P2 Div (titler Jugend) •
This Div differs fron a normal Panzer Div in the following respects:-
Tank Regt has two PANZER Ins, one TISER In and one Assault Gun In
instead of
three
tank Ins.
The two Grenadier Regiments consist of
three bns
each instead of two.
The type of Assault Gun, used by
12 SS Pz Div is almost certainly the long barrelled 75 Im (of the KWK
40 fitted to the Mark IV tank) mounted on a Mark III Chassis
reinforced with side-armour to eover the suspension.

(b) Anti tank obstaclos (Artificial).
There is some photographic evidence of minefields.
Mines can be laid very
quickly and it is safe to assume that the
beach itself, beach exits and the roads in the beach head area
will be extensively mined on D day.
Inland, all wire defences
may contain mines and should be suspeot.
In partioular, attention is drawn to the following located
(1) on the beach in front of COD (L A BRECHE strongpoint 0880).
Fract limits not known,
2) Extensive rinefields now surround the DAIMER strongpoint
1077.
hese fields are as much as 190% and ILot in denti
the North and South respectively.
These mines appear
to be outside the perimeter wire of the strong point.
(3) Strong point HITIMAN OTT? is now protected by a four-row
mine beit inside the wire.
L) A small minerield may exist on the beach opposite exit 2
