Maintenance Projeot.
The principles laid down in the original Maintenance Project
nevertheless remain unaltered as the expression of the Bde Cod's
intention.

It is obviously most unlikely that events will turn out exactly
as they have been foreseen for the purpose of planning.
For this
reason it is of vital importance that all those in key positions on
the operation should have a thorough appreciation of the principles
undetlying the administrative plan.
When unforeseen events occur,
they will then be able to use their knowledge and judgement to initiate
rapid improvisation, in order to ensure that the general intention is
carried out as nearly as possible.
reference will be made to Bde H.Q.
When improvisation is necessary,
whenever time allows.
But if
such reference would jeopardise the success of the improvisation by
delay, action will be taken immeditaly, a report being made forthwith
to Bde H.Q. stating the circumstances and the action which has been
taken to meet them.
