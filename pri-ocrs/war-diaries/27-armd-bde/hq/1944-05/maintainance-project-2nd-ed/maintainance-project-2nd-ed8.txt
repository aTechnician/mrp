POLICY
5. (a) Access to Sector Stores Dumps will be limited by
Bad going across country.
Narrow roads and traffic circuit.
Enemy demolitions.
Throughout D day, congestion will increase and condition of roads
will deteriorate as further landings take place.
It is therefore
imperative to dump as much amn as possible fwa of third lateral.
To ensure that maximum use is made of tpt on D day, amn brought fwd
and not actually required by tanks will be dumped on the ground in
a central Bde dump near Bde A Ech.
Milis and. 7 lorries will,
instructed by Bde HQ, dump their pre-loads of jerricans and compo pack:
here as well as amn, in order to allow them maximum space for further
amn to be collected.
6 lorries will,
however, be retained close to
the dump pre-loaded with amn, in order to carry out urgent
replenishment of tanks.

Should Bde 4 Ech move fudgapicquet will be left on the Be amn dump
