My dear Errol,
Just a line to let you inor how very sorry we all are that
Vovershon with his 13/18 il, are leaving us to-day.
They have all been first class,
both in the way they have
responded to our calls upon them,
and in the application of
They have beon askod
and have done, many things
that the
of their endeavours justified the manner in which
the local San Cond co-opcrated with the Int Cond on the spot.
In the STE HONORINE battle they were quite first class,
as regards their timely arrival and officient shooting,
their willingness to accopt apparent isolation whilst the Inf was
"hoaden down" by enemy mortar fire.
I vant to thank you and the Regt most awrully for their
hearty support and ready co-operation with us,
to congratulate
them on their achiovements, and to hope that the day may come, not
to distant, whon we play together again to the discomfiture of the
Hun.
Good hunting in your next shooting match.
Yours Ever,
