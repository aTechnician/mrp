AODs will return
them through the same channel,

Units are reminded that a graves label nailed to a stick or cross on a
grave is insufficient.
The Label should be placed in a tin or bottle and
half buried or tied to the cross so that it will NOT be blown away or
damaged by weather. It is extremely important that the identification of
the grave is secured. Units will therefore, arrange that somebody is
detailed to carry out these instrs as part of his normal duties.
Slaked lime is available in D.I.D,s.
