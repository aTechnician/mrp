9. Repairs to Officers' Boots
Repairs may be carried out by unit shoemakers on repayment at prices
set
out in Appendix "g" (sufficient copies enclosed for distribution to Sans
or equivalent).
0.C. Unit will recover the cost incurred and will credit the amount in the
Unit Imprest o/c. Repairs for officers will be shewn separately in the
Unit's
record of boots under repair and the date and anount of payment by
the officer
will be recorded against the entry.
If the type of repair, e.g•
stitched soles is beyond the capacity of unit
shoemakers, the repairs will be carried out by the AOD as soon as
this
is
established.
The despatch of boots to AODs will always be under unit arrangements through
B. 0.0.,
who will despatch them to the AOD by whatever means are available.
AODs will return
them through the same channel.
A17. boots handed into B.0.0. must be securely tied in pairs and the label
shewing the personal number
rank name and unit of the officer concerned
attached to each boot.
Consigments of boots must be securely packel. Inch package
must contain a
package note detailing the contents,
snowing the 3.0.0., the unit and the
ruber rank and name of the officer owning the boots.
Every precaution will be taken to safeguard the boote whilst in tronsit to
ELd fIom AOD, but no responsibility can be acoapted by the RAOd for their
vi tinate return to owners.
10. Erials.
Units are reminded that
a graves label nailed to a stick or cross on a
grave is insufficient.
Ihe label shoula be placed in a tin or bottle and
haif buried or tied to the cross so that it will NOT be blown away or
damaged by weather. It is extremely
important that the identification of
the grave is secured.
Units will therefore, arrange that somebody is
detailed to carry out these instrs as part of his normal duties.
Slaked lime is available in D.I.D.S.
