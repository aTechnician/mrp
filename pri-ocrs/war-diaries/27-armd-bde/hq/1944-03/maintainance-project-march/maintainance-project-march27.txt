WELFARE
Welfare packs will be issued in due course,
but units should,
where
possible, include in unit transport during the build up phase as much
of their
own welfare equipment as possible.
In particular units
are
advised to take wireless receivers and
individuals to take such books
as they may need.
2. Welfare packs will be brought in with balance of W.E.
