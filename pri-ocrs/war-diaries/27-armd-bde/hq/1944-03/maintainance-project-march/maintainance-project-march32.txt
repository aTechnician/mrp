REFUGEES
Beware of foreigners wearing articles of British uniform. They may claim
to be refugees - if so, they have probably obtained their clothing
illicitly; they may be enemy agents, shouldbe treated as suspect and
handed over to Pro.
8. ECONOMY
Maintenance difficulties were largoly responsible for delaying progress
at ANZIO. Waste and needless inroads
on
the limited resources
to be
landed in
this operation may well delay its progress. -
Distribution of most types
of stores has been lavish in this Bde recently
~ it is understood that follow-up formations will
be less fortunate.
All officers must seek opportunity to impress on their men that this
period is now over,
and on
the far shore ECONOMY will have a constant
and possibly a critical influence on the rate of advance.
