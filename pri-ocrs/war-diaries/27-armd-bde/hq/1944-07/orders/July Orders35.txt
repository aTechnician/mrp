Cases have occurred of kits of more than one casualty being put in
the same sandbag.
It is essential that the kit of each casualty is
packed securely in a separate bag, and labelled with Name, Rank, and
Army Number.
3.
Traffic.
Too many tracked vehicles are using the roads instead of the tracks

This causes rapid destruction and interferes with operations.
The necessity for tracked vehicles
to keep off roads whenever practicable
will again be broucht to the attention of all ranks.

3 days or more the following will be provided immediately, and clearly
