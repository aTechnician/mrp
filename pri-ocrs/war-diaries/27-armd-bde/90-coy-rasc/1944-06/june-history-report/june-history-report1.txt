90 COy. RASC. (ARma Tao-Assault)
An acoount of the work enrried out during
the first four days of the Invasion, June, 1944.
I. INTRODUCTION
The worl: done by 90 Coy. RASC, during tho first four days of the invasion is
certainly worthy of pemanent record,
closely linkod as it is with the succose of
the critical operations of tho 6th Airhome Div. and the 27th. Amd Ide in tho
Eastem extronity of the Alliod Bridzohond.
It is thought that a fairly dotailed nocount will be of gonomi intorest as
this Coy's vehiclos wore, as ovents tured out,
tho only fornatio 2nd. line RASC
to land corly on D-Day on the Dritish Seator,
and nay possibly have boch the firat
2nd line vehicles working on my Soctor.
And as will be soon fron the folloving
account, the crowlod and variod oxporioncos of the lowling clononts of this Coy
during those carly doys can hardly have hnd their countorpart in any othor doy in
The important part actually played by this Coy in relation to the operations
of tho 6th Airbome Div, und the 27th Ard, Ide vero only indirootly due to tho rolo
assignod to the Coy in the proliminary planning, ond the croater part of the work
fell to be dono purely as a rosult of the norgencion of the monent.
what was nohioved it is necessary to rofor triofly to tho planning which procoilod
the operations.
