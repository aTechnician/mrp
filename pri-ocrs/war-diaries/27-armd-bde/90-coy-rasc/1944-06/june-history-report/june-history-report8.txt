It was found that a general STAND TO had been

As far as is know that was the last and most critical attack suffered
By the Airborne,
and with the aid of tanks fron a Regt. of 27 Arma 3&e the
posicion was fully restored that evening.
During the day, owing to the reduced number of vehs available in the
Coy, assistance in Arm carrying was given by a Coy of 3 3r Div RASC.
That night, at about nidnight, a very sham air-raid developed in the
rogion of the Coy's location.
The country round COLlaViTra had by now,

Headquarters were close by and there were nunerous guns and tanks in
adjacent fields and the whole arca presumably presented a worthwhile target
to the chony.
Casualties to vchs and personol were suffered in a number
of units,
owing to HI and anti-persomel. bambs,
of which a great quantity
were dropped on the whole area.

had shrunk to 20 (out of 46 landed) and althouh,as a result of namificent
work on the part of the small body of 6 /S irtificers with the Platoo,
9 more vehs were back on the road by the croning,
it was clear that the
Coy could no longer cone with
the Airbome comitments without some relief.
Considerable further transport had by this time been landed from 3 Div

Accordingly, a complete relief was arranged during the

CONCLUSION
And so ended the nost crovded and eventrul five days that any Rasc Coy
could, it is thought, ever hope to have.
There was the great satisfaction that, despite every imaginable difriculty,
the job had never once failed to be done.
In quite an unlooked for way, there had fallen to 90 coy the high honour of
being sone of the first ashore,
and supplying and keeping supplied, the forces
who were holding what is generally agreed to have been one of the most vital
Scotars a the indoned ut i havy mãoc huà hoon osactat.
It was a great privilege and responsibility and the
26 were counted as killed missing and wounded.
lorries landed 1l had been destroyed by cney action and most of the rest to a
greater or less degree boar the marks of the stirring days they passed through.
The Coy was recently honoured by the irmediate award of the lid to the 0.0
Major J.R Cuthbertson, and the M.M to I/Col Jones,
whose name is mentioned above.
The Coy as a whole is justly proud of the job that was done and perhaps
rightly fools that it has once again proved in no uncertain fashion that the Coins
con justly clain that it alays delivers the goods.
