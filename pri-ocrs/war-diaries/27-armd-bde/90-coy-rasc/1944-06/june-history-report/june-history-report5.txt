GINTRAL NOTE ON
CONDITIONS,
going on to describe the main events of the next four days it will
bo as wel to set out hore sme of the inherent difficulties which had to be net
and overcone in the task of keping the Airborne supplied during those days.
(a)
The reserves in the Airbome area were only very snall, being
purely what had beon dropped fran the air.
The task was to
try not only to nect current consumption fron day to day (or
rather fra hour to hour) but at the sane time to build up
some sort of reserve, however small,
in the Airborne area, over
the River, in case the Bridges should be bambed or shelled, or
temporarily recaptured by
the enemy,
and an interruption in
the flow of supplies etc, should occur.
(7)
There were only a handful of vehs to perfor the task - 11 by
the evening of D-Day,
rising to 33 by
the late evening of D +1,
dropping to 23 on D + 2 owing to casualties, and finally onl
20 renained capable of carrying on
the
job by the morning of
D + 4.
And during that tine, availability was further reduced
for periods of sone hours owing to urgent calls for anything
up to 5 or 6 lorrios to assist in carriage of infantry reinforce-
nonts for 3 Ir Inf Div and delivery of Amm and sups for 27
Aid I3de.
(c)
Owing to parachute accidents etc, the sirbome personnel who
would nomally have forecast imn and Supply requirenents were
not innediatoly available,
in communication in the whole of this area ruch of the replen-
ishuent had perforec to bo done on the basis of continuously
revisod estinatos, and intelligent gucoses es to the rolativo
dogrees of urgency and priority of various typos of am and sups ato
Transport was so short that as soon as any vehicle had completed
one delivory of
câ€¢g-Supplies,
it was sent straight book to the
beaches for whatever type of am was most urgently in demond aooor~
ding to the last infomation available fran "over the laver".
(a)
Conditions noar the Deaches and around the loach Sector Storos
Durips,
whenco all replenishment had to be rindo, wore vory lif
fioult. Thore word agly alout two up and down routos which wore
usable, oving to othors not yot being clear of the enory, and as
they wore in use by all new units landing and all loach and DUKW
transport, congostion was very severe throughout the day and
romained so until at loost 2300 hrs every night.
Donbings ly
day and night were frequent and even until D + 2 isolated snipers
remained in some houses behind the beaches.
The four Sector
Stores Dumps and the othor dumps which grew out of then represch-
tod tho only sources of replenishnent and often vehicles had to
bo takon fran dump to dump searching for the only supply of sane
partioular
type
of In specially required by the Airbore.
iverone sent for in was always told what other types and quantitios
of Am by dogrees of priority should be collected, should it prove
ipossible to locate a supply of the lst priority types.
Tho
essontial thing was that no lorry under any circunstances must
undortako a wasted joumey.
To this end,
everyone down to
junior NOOs and Drivers was put right in the picture, so that
should they bo loft on their own they would always know what to
do and what usoul loads to collect.
It was also arranged that
avory NCO,
lorr--drivor or motor-cyclist either on the way to or
fron tho benches, und whether
Loadod or unloaded, invariably
reportod in, if only for a second,
as ho passod the Ilatoon Harbour
Area,
in ordor that amropriate action could be taken on the
latost infomation recoived.
Tho situation was so fluid nost of the tire that instructions
gi von
to m NCO on his way down to the beaches were often already
out of date whor he passed doy Harbour 2 hours later on his way
up to the Airbomo, and changes in routes, R Vs etc were constant.
Moroovor it was ossontinl to know fron hour to hour Just what was
