rogues quive a new sway away each day, and there is not much
enthusiasm for work on
Unreliable vehs account for
some of the
absence but this
Sunday trouble has been loss than expected,
though it has been necessary to provide a fitter some days.
f) Language difficulties have arisen, more on the paper side tha
ctual work, but after a day or two the civilians get t
know the
drin.
Against these various difficulties is the fact that once they get the
idea, the civilians (although not as efficient as RASC aves) have been found
to work very well and
enthuviastically, and are very happy to carry large
loads on their vehs for short distances.
Org overheads are very small
compared with,
eg the tpt pl, consisting at the most on any station of one
aholtern. one Sit,
one DR,
1, e Clerk, one Fluter, together with escorts drawn
from the pool for the period of the journeys only.
To sun up, this hired tpt has been found to be a useful addition to
resources but whether or not it is economical or worth while must always be a
elative matter having regard to what WD tpt resources are and also whethe
hired
tpt so employed inconveniently diminishes tpt resources required for the
local community.
