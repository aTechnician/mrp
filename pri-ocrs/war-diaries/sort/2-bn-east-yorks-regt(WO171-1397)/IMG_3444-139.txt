Cas. 2 ORs killed 17 ORS wounded.
Ba held posn and patrols by B Coy fwd to known enemy posn at a house centred in a
wood some thousand yas fwd of their poen which came to be known as PICCADILLY CIRCUS.
The weather gradually deteriorated and became wet for long periods, which combined with
the continuous shelling and mortaring made life dismal. Cas were fairly high and
amounted to 6 ORs killed 1 Offr and 61 ORs wounded. The adverse weather conditions
did not improve the road conditions and the road from Ech to the Bn was deep in mud.
food was transported to the Bn by carrieres which solved the problem but never failed
to arrive in spite of the mud and the road being frequently under sheal fire.
during this period? PWs surrendered themselves to our tps.
Bn was relieved by 2 LINCOLNS and moved back to ESCOVILLE for a short rest, baths
and a change of laundry. The Div Condr.Maj Gen LoG. Whistler D.S.0. paid the Bn a
visit and congratulated the Bn on its achievemente since he had taken over Comd.
Cas 2 killed and 1 OR wounded.
