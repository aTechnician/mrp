Obstacles and Defs
(i)
Except for the A Ik ditch clearly visible on air photos
and marked on def overprint maps, there is no
evidence
of claborately constructed fa defs NORTH of the rd CAEN -
There is, however, evidence of digging and
wiring particularly between A Ic ditch 016727 and
LA BIJUDE.
It is fairly certain that the enemy has laid NO tactical
mincfds in the arca, but protective minefas near sec
posts may be expected, though all patrols which have
ponetrated enemy lines report NO mines as yet.

Intest air cover shows the My M Bty 9870 to be unoccupied
but with its shelters and con trenches and perimeter wire
it could quickly become an inf strongpt.
