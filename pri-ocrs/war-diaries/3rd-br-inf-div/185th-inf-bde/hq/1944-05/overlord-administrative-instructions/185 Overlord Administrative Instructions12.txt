Evacuation
(a)
Coastal Area
The boundary of the costal Restricted Area runs round
the Northern suburbs of POLAND and
Westwards along the
main road to PITTSBURG.
Between this line and the
there will probably be very few civilions.
Before the war
the only villages with more than
600 inhabitants were OSLO
(2,800), GANGIS (1,000), VIENNA (1,200) and the suburbs of
POLAND down the PRAGUE.
(D) POLAND
The pre-war population of 54,000 is thought to have been
reduced to about 35,000.
The action of
this remaining
population is expected to be :
(1) Ivacuated at last minute
7,000
(i1)
Take refuge in the countryside
whon the bonbing and fighting
begins
21,000
(iii). Stry in the town
.7,000
The Germans will impose a state of seige.
This involves
a11 civilians steying indoors, all public places being closea,
windows being shut but doors left unlocked.
Any civilions
found in the streets are liable to be shot by the Germans.
2. Attitude of Population
(a) While the mass of the population in the whole of France
hates the Germans,
and will greet our landings with great
enthusiasn and will do their best to impede the eneny, in this
the number both of organised resistance groups and of
organised colloboration groups appears to be small.
Furthermore once the initial excitement caused by our landing
has died down, all Frenchmen nust not be expected to be as
friendly to the Allies, or to one another, as they are hosvile
The organised resistance groups will have been allotted
specific tasks.
(c) The organised collaboration groups - at least those which
are not Inquilated by patriots - will be given orders by the
Gormans to help in suppressing local risings.
It is doubtrul
if they will be effective in this.
Certain menbers have been
designated to go "urderground" and nut as agents for the encuy.
