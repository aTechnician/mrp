Replenishment by LAD

BRAVES

Units are reminded that a
graves label nailed to a stic: or cross on a
grave is insufficient.
The label
should be
placed
in a tin or bottle and half
buried or tied to the cross so
that it will NOT be blown away
or damaged by
weather.
It is extremely important that the identification of the grave is
secured.
Units will,
therefore, orrange that somebody is detailed to carry out
these instrs as part of his normal duties.
