Summary of Events and Information
In view of limited success of Op MITTET, Op ARIPIOUR again postponed.
185 Inf Bde Adm Order No. 2
185 Inf Bde Adm Order No.3
Receipt of message from 1 Corps:
Enemy now in posn to put in counter-attack
although it is not expected that thrust will be on 1 Corps front especial
vigilance will be mainteined during the three hours
before first light and
the three hours before last light.
And ao the month comes to an end on a note of expectancy; expecting an enemy
thrust,
and expecting our on attack.
We had nearly bounced the enemy baok
nto CAFN on D dey,
but having not succeeded in what would have been a very
remarkable event in the face of the opposition fron one inf div and one panze:
division (the pride of the German armoured fornations in the VEST) we vero
forced to sit down and 'take it' in the form of ever increasing IF,
behind a
wall of nines and very active patrolling. We could have taken LUBISFY at any
time during the month but such an isolated op would have been useless in
view of the stiff opposition meeting the Bdes on our right.
The losses the
Bde suffered during this period were considerable incl many offns but during
the period we had the measure of the enemy and knew him extremely well by
end of the month.
We were only too keen for the much disoussed attack
to be put into operation.
Capt C.0.
BLAKIY, 2 WARWICK took over as GSO.III from Capt P.A. BAIT who.
went to his battalion
as Adjutant.
