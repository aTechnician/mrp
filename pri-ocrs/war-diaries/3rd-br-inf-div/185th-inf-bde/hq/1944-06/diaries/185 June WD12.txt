on Advance of 2 KSLI
1. The decision to withdraw from INBISI was disappointing but the delay imposed
upon 1 NORTOIK and 2 WARWICK by enemy opposition in HILLMAN and MORRIS ahd on
canal road put entirely out of the question any attempt to move up
these battalions
in close support of 2 KSII that night.
2.
The advance of seven miles, mostly across country, and against considerable
opposition, considering also the delays experienced in getting up its supporting
urms and its tank regiment from the beach.
was
an extremely creditable
erformance. About 50 IW were captured during th
advance and about 100 more
during mopping up
by
other units, and a large number of the neny were killed.
In conjunction with STAFFS YEO thirteen enemy tanks were destroyed and 8 guns
captured.
Much of the success was due
to the excellent cooperation between
2 KSLI and STAFIS YEO.
Notes on
SEX action
The results of this action were extremely
disappointing and failure may be
ascribed
to.
the following reasons:-
1.
Air photographs and all other available infomation during the planning period
gave little indication of the eneny centres of resistance
in this area (according
to PW troops were not moved into the wood until D - 1,
although undoubtedly
a number of iC positions had been dug).
Moreover the leading elements of the
2 KSLI who had reached into the wood on D Day had no reason to believe that
the enemy were in any great strength,
2.
The particular emphasis which was
laid on speed and the necessity, to take
risks at this stage ofthe operation. It was still hoped to bounce the enemy
off his feet before he had time to preparedand occupy his positions.
The unexpectedly thick nature of the country and the concealment it afforded
to MGs and snipers.
440,
The presence of enemy tanks through very
thick wooded country effect of which
was aggravated by the difficulty of getting up anti-tank guns over the anti-
tank obstacle.
5.
The fact that tanks were not allowed to give 2 WARWICK close support.
CONCLUSION
In spite of the setbacks there is no doubt that 2 WARWICK and 1 NORFOLK
fought most gallantly under very difficult circumstances.
There were many
examples of outstanding junior leadership. A large number of the enemy were
killed.
