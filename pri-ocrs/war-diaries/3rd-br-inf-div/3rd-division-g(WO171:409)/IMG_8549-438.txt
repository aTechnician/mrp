DEFENCE, OF CARN
As a centre of conmunications and of Army, Air
Force and civil HQ, CAN is likely to be stubbornly
detended by the Germans within the limits of the
forces at their disposal.
(b)
The Garrison
Without allowing for possibility of the defence
being stiffened by additional units moving into the town
by D đay,
the following provisional estimate of the
available
garrison is made:

This battalion is
likely
to form a static garrison
for CAEN.

been reported,
200 is regarded
as a more likely figure.
Total
2, 000
Information is at present too scanty to show the
framework of the enemy plan for defending CAEN, but
from
the nature of the ground it is apparent that the
town
must be defended on the
ground outside the
town itself.
The projected anti tank ditch to the
NORTH
confirms this view.

It is unlikely that the ditch will
