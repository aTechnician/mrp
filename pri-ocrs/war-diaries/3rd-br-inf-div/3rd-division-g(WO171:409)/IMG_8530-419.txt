AIRFIELDS
CARPIQUET
(a)
This airfield is still operational as a station for
single engined fighters or fighter-bombers.
the event of its being
abandomed shortly before an
invasion, it would probably be obstructed and the
defences abandonned, but in view of the excellence of
the site, which gives good going in all weathers, it
is unlikely that it could at
short
notice be made
completely unusable.
Therefore some of the lA defences
would remain in position with their own local
protection, in order to prevent its use by us.
(b)
The AA
defences consist mostly of light
guns..
but there
are usually some 80 mm guns as well.
The exact
position and mounting of
any 88 mm guns is being
examined and will be issued later.
