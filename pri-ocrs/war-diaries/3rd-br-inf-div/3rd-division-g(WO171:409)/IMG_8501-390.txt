An old report fron a moderate source states that in Nov 43
Tiger Tanks were seen NORM Of CARN.
the tactical sign of & SP A Ik unit.
These "tanks" bore
It 1S
possible,
therefore,
that they were FERDirds.
As 716 Div has nc
nown A rik bn or its own,
it is quite reasonable to expect
that elements of a GHQ A Ik bn would be placed undor command.
Othor evidence of tanks in the area comes from a
report dated Oct 43, when some were stated to be in the
vicinity of Div HQ,
and from the tank tracks annotated
on the 1:25,000 defence overprint (24 Feb) in the arca
of BIEVILLE.
