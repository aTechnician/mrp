The Germans apparently intend to
construct a
continuous anti-tank
obstacle round the Northern
Weston ayro and this will prosumably constitute
as they ahve done at certain other

Inside the town proper, apart from AA positions,
the only reported defence positions against ground
attack are wall road-blocks, 6 ft high and with
in the area of
Loop-holes for apon pits at the fastern outskirts
De the touc
and pillboxes covering the main road
bridges at 038678, where moveable road blocks of
element C are kept available.
A recent report stated that large numbers of
workers
of the ORGANISTION TODI are at present in
C/EN, which probably means that the construction
defences continues.
