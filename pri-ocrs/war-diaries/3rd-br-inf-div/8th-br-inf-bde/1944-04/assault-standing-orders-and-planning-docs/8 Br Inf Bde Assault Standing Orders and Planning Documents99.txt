I? there is a shambles on the underwater obstacle this must be inunt in in? i

In the event of para 5 being adopted the following courses are open:
(a)
Reserve Bde (9 Br Inf Bde Gp) goes in as timed or is held up until such
time as it is required.
(b)
(c)
Intermediate Bde (185 Inf Bde Gp) refoms ready to follow reserve bde.
Reserve Bde is committed and the intermediate bde held up
to form 1 Corps
floating reserve to be landed at NAN as soon as possible.
(a)
Both intermediate and reserve baes are held up and form I Corps floating
reserve to be landed at NAN as soon as possible.
Naval plan must be sufficiently flexible to cope with this.
• Assault Bde Alternatives
Only in the event of a major disaster resulting in complete confusion on the
underwater obstacle can
there be any question of holding back any of the Assault Be
roup.
Exoept for the above circumstance information is not available in time to permit
of such a grave decision being taken and it would be bad for morale to countenance
such an alternative.
The
Assault Bde whatever the circumstances must
land with
supporting arms and reserve ammunition to enable it to fight and maintain itself
1,11i it can be reinforced.

casualties to craft in the assault bde must be considered and planned for by
Asst Bde Coma and Captain GS 3.
Where ISI carrying assault coys is sunk the task
must be carried out by res coys.
The plans must be approved by Coma 3 Br Inf Div
and Cond Force S.
Faulty Landfall
9, (a)
A faulty landfall up to 1000 yas to the WEST will not materially affect tho
arny plan,
(b)
A faulty landfall of more than 500 yas to the EAST will be
serious as it
is doubtful if assault infantry or vehdoles will compete with the mud ani.
the prospect of a wide stretch of open sand or mud to traverse against
opposition,
A faulty lendfall to the EAST of WALGRAVE could probably be met by on
alternative army plan but its success would be jeopardised by the batter.ee
in close proximity to either flank of the landing.
(т)
An alternative plan must be made to lend on GREEN.
Alternatives must be prepared by the Assault Bde and GS
3 to meet LSI
sinkings,
