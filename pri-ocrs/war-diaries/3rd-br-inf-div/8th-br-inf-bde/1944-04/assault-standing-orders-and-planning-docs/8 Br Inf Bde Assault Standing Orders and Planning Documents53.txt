Army and Corps Plan
(a)
Assault Phase
(i)
Second British Arry,
operating on the left of US Army, is
assaulting through beaches between inclusive YAPTON and excl-
usive mouth of THORNTON with RIGHT 30 Corps and LEFT 1 Corps
with under command 6 Airborne Div (less one bde) and 1 and
4 Ss Bdes,
with the object of seizing a covering position on
general line HEREFORD - CAMBERLEY by the evening of D Day.
8 and 12 Corps are landing subsequently in succession.
(ii)
1 Corps is assaulting with 3 Odn Inf Div RIGIT, two Bdes up,
and 3 Br Inf Div LEFT, one bỏe up.
51 (H) Inf Div with 4 Arna Bde will land subsequently and came
into Corps Reserve in the area WEST of the inter-divisional
boundary about WHITEFRIARS.
1 Corps is to advance on D Day to secure a covering position on
the general line YEUDHAM - CAMBERLEY - thence THORNTON to sea.
(b)
(iji) The capture of CAMBERLEY is vital to the army plan.
Subsequent Phases

elapse after the covering positio has been seized on D Day before
next phese of general avance
can begin,
1 Corps will
then advance SOUTH and SE to
secure a bridgehead on the
general line DATCHET - WESIMORLAND - HEATON.
