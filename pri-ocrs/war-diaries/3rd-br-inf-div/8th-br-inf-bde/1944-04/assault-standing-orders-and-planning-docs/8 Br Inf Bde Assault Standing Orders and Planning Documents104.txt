Destruction of Luftwaffe by bombing aircraft factories and destruction
of fighter vircraft in the air has been going on since summer 1943 and

Control

Most targets will be pre-arranged but as new targets appear air emport

Tac/R will be similarly arranged on a high level. Demands for infer-
ation will be met by Tae/R sorties if the information cannot be sup lied
fron reports already received from previous Tac/R or operational sorties.

the early capture and
development of which are essential to the maintenance of air effort.
5.
