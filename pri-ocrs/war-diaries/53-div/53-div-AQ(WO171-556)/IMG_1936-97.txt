HO 53 Div Rear leaves LA CHAFPLIE DU BOIS DES FAULX for JES MUTDS 3188 to
cross the R SEINE at that point by a Cl 9 br constructed by Div RE.
Uneventful though pleasant journey through most
attractive country con-

sections, each section joined to a natural island in the middle from
opposite shores. Impressive scenery from IES MUIDS (3188) on the NORTH
bank, up to In THUIT (3693).
