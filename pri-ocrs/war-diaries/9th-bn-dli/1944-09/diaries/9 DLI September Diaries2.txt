INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING AND DISPOSING OF THE
WAR
DIARY
(F.S.R., VOL, T., 174.)
1. The objects of a war diary are two-fold: -
(a) To provide information from theatres of war in sufficient detail and in such a form
as to provide data
upon which to base future improvements in Army training, equipment, organisation and administration.
The views and constructive recommendations of commanders are welcomed for this purpose.
(b) To furnish an historical record of the war.
A section of the War Office has been established to scrutinise war diaries as soon as they arrive in the United
Kingdom in order to extract all possible information of value under 1 (a) above.
It is therefore of the utmost
importance that completed diaries should be submitted promptly in accordance with the terms of para. 11 below.
3. A war diary will be kept in duplicate* by: â€”
GENERAL.
(a) Each branch of the staff at the headquarters of a formation, a subordinate command, and area or sub-area
on the L. of C.
(b) Unit commanders.
(c) Commanders of a headquarters or unit on detachment.
d) Base, auxiliary and advanced depot commanders.
(e) Heads of Services and their representatives.
Note: In the case of headquarters, sections of the various branches may keep separate war diaries or one
combined war diary as is found convenient.
4. Both original and duplicate* copies will consist of: -
(a) Cover;
b) Index as printed on cover;
(a) Appendies.
All details of the unit and formation (if a detachment is concerned, the name of the parent unit), period
covered and folio numbers of appendices will be shown on the cover.
METHOD OF COMPILATION.
6. The war diary will be signed once, as a report, by the commander of a unit, head of a branch, or senior staff
offcer.
It is a secret document.
The extraction and retention of appendices, maps, etc., from a war diary is an
offence under the Official Secrets Acts.
7. In order to ensure accuracy and completeness and to save work, as much important information as possible
will be conveyed in appendices consisting, with one exception, of copies of documents issued and received in normal
routine.
The narrative is intended to supply information not given in the appendices.
