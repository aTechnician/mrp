(a) We shall shortly be taking part in the next phase of
operations - the final phase - The Battle of™
Germany
itself.
For many years the Germans have succeeded in
waging war outside their own frontiers, and have not
had to endure the devastation and disruption to human
life which they have caused in other European countrios.
Now their turn is coming at last, as well they know.
The Nazi leaders in sheer desperation are determined to
continue fighting, for Gemany is completely under the
influence of the
Gestapo and sS.
The war must end either
by the
complete crushing of the German Army or by
breaking the will of the people to obey Hitler and his
chiefs.
(b)
In the
towns and villages which we have liberated we have
been feted and welcomed by an overjoyed population.
In
Germany it will be different, although many will
be pleased to seo us as an end to their suffering.
inwardly
No
one can trust his neighbour, as for years every man's
hand has been against any who have failed to respond to
the Nazis wishes.

all times be correct, but on no account will any for of
fraternisation be allowed.
Whe rover we happen to be, no
civilians must be allowed inside our own localitios.
