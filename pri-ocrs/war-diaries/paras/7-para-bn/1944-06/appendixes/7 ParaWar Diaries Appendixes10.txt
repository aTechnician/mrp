than I had dared hope.
I therefore laid on
the first offensive
demonstration which was a deylight raid by B coy (the reserve and
patrolling company) apainst this building area and timed it for the
following afternoon.
In
the reantime the snipers were doing excellent work and
first day,
except one who having
each claimed two victims on their

iwas after

led to see snother target and so got none.
B company's raid took place at 1430 hrs on the 18th and
Involved artillery and mortar support.
It was an
expensive effort
but was well carried out and was
extremely successful.
The
position was well shot up and about
30 enemy were killed there and
the others given a good fright.
What was more important though was
that six prisoners were taken and some of these talked freely

areas occupied by their two forwara companies.
The designation of the battalion and companies concerned.
The area of the third company
was estblished fairly accurately
by Capt keene, who led the raid.
Casualties suffered were :-

Nineteen (including 3 offrs 1.e. Parrish, Poole,
Farr).
The fatigue situation was now rather serious; I had hoped *p/
that the reserve
company would have had an easy time
and intended
to use that
area for resting purposes.
Now the occupants of that
position were more
tired than the
rest of
the battalion having
carried out the raid, and had little prospect of being able to
rest.
on the night of the l8th I started wiring my front and flanks
on the
advice'of the Bde cond.
A party of RE,
augmented by men
from the left forward company, put up a complete line of wire
during this night.
This wire was, of course,
no obstacle in
itself but it was tactically sited and
the subsequent thickening of
it was a non-specialist job
and was carried out as opportunity
offered.
The presence of the wire was a great comfort to the
forward troops.
The 19th was a comparitively quiet day with the usual contact
patrols and snipers active in
front of the
position.
The enery
she lled
and mortared the
position accurately from time to
time
and the
artillery organised a counter-mortar drive
for which the
good work of the
Int. sec. with their accurate shelling reports and
bearings was invaluable:
A wounded POW was brought in by
a contact
patrol.
The GOC visited the area and ordered the Independant Para
Coy
to come up and relieve me of
patrolling
and raiding
duties
so that the reserve company could really rest (between the periods
of shelling) •
The Independent para Coy
(1 offr and 40 onlJ) arrived
on the morning of the 20th and I briefed them at once
for my
next
offensive demonstration.
This was to be a prisoner-grabbing raid
by a
small party on the enemy's left i.e, track junc 148720 and
was to have artillery and mortar support.
The raid was delayed because the enemy occupied the
start line
(driving out a small &tanding patrol I had there) and
a platoon I had of the right forward
company had to attack and
drive
out; this platoon was led by the
coy coma (Maj Bartlett)
and was successful but Bartlett and one OR were wounded.
Good work
was done here by

called for it but also arranged for the guns to remain laid on the
