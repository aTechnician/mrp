At 0425 hrs on 16 June the village
was suddenly and
heavily
shelled.
- The
first shells
were from
"Moaning
Minnies"
and one of
them struck the side of the house
I was
lusing as my HQ.
At this hour practically
everyone was in
their
trenches
and the
casualties suffered from the shelling,
sudden and heavy as it was,
were negligible.
An attack
seemed not improbable however
and this was
confirmed when the
armd car patrol
found about 200
Germans in the usually
empty ESCOVILLE at first light.
The dog-leg wood between ESCOVILLE and my
position
offered
the enemy a good covered
line
of approach and start
line
for an attack.
therefore ordered B coy
to keep a
close
watch on this wood; they could not enter it because
previous unit had laid a mine field between my positions and
the wood and this field had not been charted.
After several
hours
B'coy reported signs of movement and it became almost
a certainty
that an
attack was
pending.
I would have welcomed an attack from this direction
because B coy were in good positions and although they were
understrength they had increased
their fire power by including
several
Gerran MGs, which they
captured in previous battles,
into
tbeir
position
- there was also the uncharted minefield
which would have accounted for some enemy for certain.
The battalion mortars,
with an OP in B coy area,
put hundreds of bombs right onto the right part of the wood
and I later thickened this up with artillery.
Enemy tanks were spotted
first to
the SE of
ESCOVILLE and then
to the SW of it.
When they were SW of it
a most annoying thing happened.
one of my
17
prs,
in a very
good position,
had a
tank which was thought to be a Tiger in
their
sights
but at rather
long range; this tank was coming
in nicely and the
gunners were
just
beginning to rub their
hands in anticipation of a kill when one of the arma cars
appeared on the scene and opened fire on the
tank with its
pr
it
gun.

This had no visible
effect
on
the
Tiger
but caused
spray the area with MG fire (killing the
my 17 pr) and then move off.

The
enemy infantry attack still had not been
launched by 1000 hrs so I decided to make up
their minds for
them,
and ordered A
COy
to enter the dog-leg wood at the
western tip and sweep
far as the Chateau at ESCOVILLE.
They entered the wood
at 1800 as and auly carried out their
task.
The mortars dropped
their bombs onto the wood up to
the
moment of entry by the sweeping party but I lifted the artillery
onto ESCOVILLE
itself and the
southern exits from it.
It was possible to get some idea of how the sweeping was
going by
observation from B coy area and it looked to be going
well as indeed it was.
The party
returned after two hours with about
20 prisoners and reported killing many more in the wood itself.
