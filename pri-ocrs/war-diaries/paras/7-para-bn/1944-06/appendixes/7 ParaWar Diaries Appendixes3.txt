Heavy casualties
were inflicted on the enemy (many
more would have been
inflicted if I
could have used mortars and
MMGS) and all attacks were
beaten
off.
No further closing in on
the bridge end was
therefore
necessary.
The snipers in LE PORT were
a constant source of
trouble and excellent work was done by 5 pl
(Poole) in dealing with them.
At one
time a PIAT (Cpl Killeen)
was used most successfully against snipers in
the tower of the
Achurch in
LE PORT.
The snipers too showed little initiatave and
twelve bodies were
later found in the church tower.
At
1200 hrs on D Day the piper of 1 SS Ede could be heard in
STAUBIN 0876.
This was
the
pre-arranged recognition signal but
I did not
give the answering bugle callf as this would
have meant
that the way was clear for

Bde to come through. Until the
Of LE PORT had been cleared this was not the case.
However
the
leading elements of the Bde (No 6 Commando) succeeded where
the Germans
had failed and found my weak spot.
At 1330 hrs the
first Commando troops entered my HQ area
from the North having
worked round the SW of LE PORT.

in the clearing of LE PORT and

i.e. 1215 hrs and all ears were
strained for the pre-arranged
bugle regognition call ("Defaulters") which was to be sounded from
StAUBIN by
the leading unit (E. YORKS) which was to relieve the
battalion in its bridgehead position.
Further attacks were launched on the battalion position
during the afternoon.
At one period.
as a novelty,
two gun boats
came up the CNNAL. Fire was held until they reached
the bridge
when one of them was put
out of action by a
PIAT fired by Howards
force from the bridge area. The second one turned round and made
off quickly while the first one opened fire with its
gun (which was
remote controlled) and shot up my HQ area.
There were several
lucky escapes
and only one slight
casualty.
The crew of the boat
were taken prisoner.
