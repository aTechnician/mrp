Line until I said that I would not want
them further;
this enabled
me to bring fire onto
the area without delay at any time and
was used to cover the
withdrawal of the patrol (which would not
have been possible with a timed programme) and also enabled me to
put down a extra concentration fifteen minutes after the raid
hich might well have
caused casualties amongst Gerrans who hed
me up to find out what had happened

blowing from East to West that afternoor
so I ordered two smoke
bombs
to
be put down by
the mortars just
North of the objective at the time

of the
patrol (1700 hrs) •
The enemy fired blindly into the smoke,
as
Is his habit, from the area where his reserve company wes
suspected to
be (thus confirming my suspicions); a tremendous
volume of smallA
arms fire was produced.
No casualties were

The raid was
successful and three
prisoners were collected.

killed in

included two with an MG and

now compelled to draw

men were extremely

the normal double

to be altered

during

day
when not needed for

patrols,
sniping or
wiring

and with the low strength of companies
these
duties
came round very quickly to each
individual.
It was noticeable
that as I got less aggressive so the
enemy
got bolder and reports of novement on
patrols
(sometimes with dogs on leads) moving round my right flank in
the
BoIs, digging in in areas well forward of his known front line
and uncomfortably close to mine were constantly coming in on these
days.
The
shelling and mortaring also
increased considerably and
a few casualties occurred every day despite
positions

and slit trench discipline.
The morale of the men was superb but they were very
tired and it would have been dangerous to lauach them on anything
but the simplest of short range patrols.
This was particularly
malling as
I knew that the battalion if
fresh, and at anything
ire. its normal strength, could have cleaned up the whole front
in an afternoon's fighting.
on 22 June I changed over A (left forward) and B (reserve )
companies as B coy had then had 48 hrs in the rest
area with only
shelling to worry them.
C company (right forward) was also relieve
by a company of
the 12th Para Bn (which came under my comd) and
went back to rest in the de HQ area.
The 23 June wes an ominously quiet day with almost complete
freedome from shelling and mortaring but with further
reports from
the contact patrols of enemy activity includin*
some disquieting
reports of vehicles in the area which suggested the arrival of
enemy reinforcements or fresh troops being brought in.
I laid
on another raid on that afternoon
