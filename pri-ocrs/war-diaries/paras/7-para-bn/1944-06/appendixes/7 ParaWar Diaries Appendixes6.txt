After clearing Z wood the battalion was to secure ra june
133726 and
send
X rds
out patrols to contact 3 Para Bde In the area
1372.
I detailed B Coy to clear woods W, Y and Z and A Coy to
clear wood x and
to secure the ra june at 133726.
The infantry start line was
the East face of wood 118733
and the time of start was 1600 hrs.
The attack started at the appointed hour but difficulty
s experienced from the start in co-ordinating with the
tanks.
These latter came up in
pairs
when
and
it was
hard to know
they were all up
as I understood that a san was being used
but actually only six tanks appeared
at any time.
It was also
very hard to know when they had finished firing because on only
one
occasion did I see a smoke
shell fired and on several
occasions there were
tanks on
fire which produced so much
smoke themselves that it was diffioult to see what was happening.
A11
six tanks
were eventually hit and burned out,
this happened
before the assault on Z.
wood was begun and the
assault on this
wood was carried out without
tank support.
Fortunately the wood
was unoccupied and the support was not necessary.
The clearing of w wood went without a hitch and several
Germans
were killed
(Major Neale was wounded) and A Coy duly
passed
through and cleared x wood,
where
several more
were killed.
Two of the
tanks were ablaze
at
Germans
this stage.
The remaining
tanks
then fired well into Y
wood
and A
coy gave covering fire for B coy's approach to it.
When B coy entered
the West end of Y wood a white flag
was waved from the NE corner of it.
The wood was thick and it
was difficult to sort out the situation as,
the wood were not aware that the Germans were trying
of course to
B coy in
surrender.
About 4e were taken prisoner
sorting out of them delayed A Coy,
here and the
who should have followed
В соу
closely into the wood in anticipation of the next stage.
When I eventually
got A coy on the move again
found that
Rear Bn HQ had got ahead
of Adv
East end
of y wood (which B coy
Bn H9 and was,
in
fact
had completely
cleared' and
at the
I found my 2 1/c (Steele-Baume) busy marshalling a batch of
about
40 more prisoners whom he appeared to have partially
stripped.
At this stage I modified the plan as the delay
prisoners had
over the
anxious
caused a slowing of the momentum which I was
to avoid; I therefore ordered B COy
to
sweep Z
wood
immediately and held A coy for ten minutes and then sent them
off at best speed by the road to secure the ra junc. Adv en Ha
went with A coy and Rear En HQ with B coy.
there were no enemy either in 7.
The final stage was something of an anti-climax as
Para Bde were in fact
at
wood or at the rd junc.
3rd
contacted an RE captain who was
the rd junc themselves and there
in command of a party found by
3rd Para Bde whose area
was centred on the rd junc.
Casualties suffered by the battalion were :-
Killed
Nil.
Wounded
Nine (includes one officer (Najor Neale)).
