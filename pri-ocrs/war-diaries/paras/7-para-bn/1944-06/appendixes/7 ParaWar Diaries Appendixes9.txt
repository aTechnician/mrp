Period spend in BOIS DE BAVENI.
As for 0.0. No 1.
On the evening of the day of the
action
at HEROUVILLETTE I
received orders to relieve the 8th En in the BOIS DE
BAVENT sector
the following day.
This was part of a change over of the two Para
Bdes and was
ordered because the mental strain of the close
fighting In the wooded country was a great test and the 3rd para
Bde were even more tired than
we were
even though we had had more
fighting.
I sent the 2 1/c (Steele-Baume) with a small advanced
party to
the new area that night (16th June) and he arrived just
in time to receive the evening's shelling of the area.
At 0700 hrs on the
17th the move began (it was not to

on any sector of either Bde's fronts - HQ 6 Airborne Div gave
order).
I had to leave one
company at HEROUVILLETTE
and take over
the new sector with the other two companies so that for
a period
on the 17th I was responsible for both areas,
with the 8th bn
on the move between them.
Luckily nothing developed in either
area during this nerve-straining period.
The area for which the battalion was responsible in the
BOIS area was bounded on the North by the
13th Para En,
on the
South by
the BOIS DE BAVENT, on the East by the enemy and on the
West by
the road BREVILLE-TROARN.
Actually a track encircled
the area and I decided to regard the area within this track and
the main road (1472) as sacred to the battalion and to allow

I decided to hold firm in my area
