CHAPTER VII
THE DEFENCE
67. General considerations
1. The considerations which will guide a commander in
deciding to adopt a defensive attitude are given in Field
Service Regulations, Volume III, 1935, Chapter III. The
selection of a position, the organization of the defence, the
employment of the outposts, the location and handling of the

power of his weapons can be developed; to strengthen it as
time permits; and by concealment to avoid the fire of the
enemy's weapons and to gain surprise. The chief object of

minimum expenditure of his own. He may then eventually
