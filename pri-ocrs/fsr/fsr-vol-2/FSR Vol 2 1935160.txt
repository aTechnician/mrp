4. It will be the duty of signals to provide efficient ground
communication between the units of the air force co-operating
in the attack and the formations with which they are working.
5. See Sec. 16, 8, as regards the use of liaison personnel.
66. Aircraft in the attack
1. Local air superiority (see Sec. 8, 1) over the area of attack
is essential in order to enable the aircraft detailed for close
reconnaissance and co-operation to carry out their tasks
without undue interference from enemy air forces; also to
prevent as far as possible the enemy from making a detailed
reconnaissance of the movements and dispositions of the
attacking troops and from directing the fire of his artillery
on to them.
2. Bomber squadrons can be used effectively to attack
the enemy's troops and transport, to disturb his rest and to
lower his morale. In exceptional circumstances fighter
squadrons can carry out low-flying attack on enemy troops,
but the possible effect on the general air situation of their
withdrawal from their normal function and the heavy
casualties to be expected with a well-trained enemy of good
morale must be considered before such attacks are ordered.
3. Throughout the attack, army co-operation squadrons
will carry out the duties of medium, close, artillery and
photographic reconnaissance. Efficient means of inter-
communication between the squadron commander and the
commander of the formation with which he is working are
essential.
