CHAPTER II
THE COMMAND AND CONTROL OF TROOPS
IN BATTLE
11. The elements of tactics
1. Modern weapons and the conditions of battle which
they have created throw increasing responsibility on junior
commanders: success in battle will depend largely on their
efficiency.
The essential qualities of leadership, morale, the
tighting spirit and discipline are defined and described in
Training Regulations, 1934, Sec. 2, which should be read
in conjunction with this
chapter.
Although leadership
is not born of learning, and in battle rests mainly on such
qualities as energy, endurance,
vigilance, activity and a
constant inquisitiveness, yet without a
thorough under-
standing of the elements of tactics these qualities will not be
properly applied and will fail to achieve the success which
they deserve.
2. Tactics on the battlefield are governed by certain
simple commonsense precepts, which are in the main very
similar to those which govern everyday life. The ordinary
citizen who is planning a business transaction, goes through
much the same steps as the commander in the field who is
planning an operation.
Both begin by informing themselves
as fully as possible; both, if they are wise, limit their enterprise
to suit their means; both can best arrive at a decision by
summing up to themselves in the form of a balanced state-
of their action; both, if they be men of character, will abide
by a decision once made and carry out what they have planned,
unless some entirely unforeseen circumstances occur. Thus
the occasions both of peace and of war call for the same
qualities of commonsense and a balanced judgment. But in
war the time factor is always more urgent, information is
