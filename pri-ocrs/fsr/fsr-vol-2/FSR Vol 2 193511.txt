Messrs. Grindlay & Company, Limited, would
remind Officers in His Majesty's Services, whether
stationed in England, India or elsewhere, that they
are free to appoint any firm or bank they please as
personal agents.
Messrs. Grindlay & Company, Limited, are pre-
pared to act in this capacity. As a result of their
experience of over a century they have built up an
organisation fully equipped to protect the interests of
any Officer who may be desirous of making use of
their services as Bankers or Agents, and in the latter
capacity they undertake numerous duties which are
outside the scope of a Joint Stock Bank. They would
call attention particularly to their Passage and Ship-
ping Departments in London and India, which are
maintained for the purpose of advising their customers
and relieving them of the trouble involved in securing
passages and the shipment, clearing and insurance of
baggage.
Messrs. Grindlay and Company, Limited, will be
happy to send to any Officer a prospectus of their
business, on application.
