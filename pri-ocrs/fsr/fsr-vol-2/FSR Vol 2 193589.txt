[Chap. III. Sec. 30.
Bivouacs mean concentration and readiness and enable the
most favourable dispositions of the troops to be made from
the tactical point of view, but they are trying to the health
of men and animals in cold or wet weather.
Camps or huts are healthy and can be sited to meet tactical
and administrative requirements, but they require time to erect
or construct, and can usually be used only in base areas or
in conditions of static warfare.
Trench shelters and dug-outs are used in position warfare:
their prolonged occupation is detrimental to health, morale
and discipline.
2. In the presence of an enemy, tactical considerations,
e.g. favourable ground for deployment, concealment from
observation, cover from air attack or bombardment, economy
in outposts, will determine the type of quarters to be occupied.
Otherwise, the health and comfort of the troops is the first
consideration, though the possibility of attack from the air
will usually have to be taken into account.
The arrange-
ments for protection when at rest are dealt with in Chapter V.
