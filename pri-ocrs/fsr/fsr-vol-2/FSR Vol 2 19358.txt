C the BRITISH
SALMSON
A standard of quality unusual in
the manufacture of cars
- T More
THE BRITISH SALMSON combines the speed,
smoothness, stability, and acceleration of high-powered cars with
the low running costs of small cars which cannot approach its
performance.
From a standing start the standard 12/50 saloon
reaches fifty miles per hour in 18? secs., and the petrol consumption
is thirty miles per gallon.
The 12/70 sports model, with ample
accommodation for four, has a speed of eighty miles per hour, and
a petrol consumption of 27/30 miles per gallon. The British Salmson
stands alone in meeting the demand for an economical high-speed
car of medium size and unsurpassed efficiency. It is built to give
long life with the minimum of mechanical attention, and carries a
two years' guarantee.
