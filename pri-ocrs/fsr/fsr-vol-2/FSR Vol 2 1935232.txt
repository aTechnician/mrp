sidered in the preparation of the administrative paragraphs
of operation orders, or in separate administrative orders when
such are issued. Several of them concern the orders of higher
formations only (Armies, Corps or Divisions). Adminis-
trative, like other, orders should be as concise as possible, and
should include only such matter as is essential for the purpose
in view.

orders are not included in the table.

ments; enclosures for prisoners of war.
Ammunition
Railheads; refilling points; ammunition
points; special arrangements for advance
or withdrawal; location and stocks of
temporary depots; responsibility and
labour for working depots; accountancy
instructions.
NOTE.â€”If an allotment of rounds for
each gun is made or a limit set to expendi-
ture, instructions for this are issued by the
general staff after consultation with the
administrative branches of the staff.
Baggage
...
Meeting points; arrangements for distribu-
tion and collection.
Captured areas Administration of area; control of civilians ;
examination of water supplies; sanitary
precautions; disposal of captured docu-
ments.
