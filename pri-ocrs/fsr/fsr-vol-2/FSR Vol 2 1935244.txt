USE OF PONTOON EQUIPMENT
The equipment with a pontoon bridge park is sufficient
for :-
(a) Medium bridge a combined pontoon and trestle
bridge of 798 ft.
(6) Heavy bridge a combined pontoon and trestle bridge
of 525 ft.
NOTES.-(1) Combination of trestles and pontoons is de-
pendent upon depth of water, etc., local conditions will, as
a rule, impose some limitations upon the use of one or the
other.
(2) Rafts, medium and heavy, can be made with the pontoon
equipment.

Gravelly bottoms are best; sandy bottoms are bad, as the
sand gets stirred up, thus increasing the depth of water.
The depth of a river is generally most uniform in straight
parts; at bends the depth will generally be greater at the
concave bank and less at the convex.
For this reason a
river which is not anywhere fordable straight across may be
found passable in a slanting direction between two bends.
All fords should be clearly marked by strong pickets driven
into the river bed above and below the ford, their heads being
connected by a strong rope. Marks should be made on those
pickets which stand in the deepest water, at a height of s feet
and 4 feet above the bottom, in order that any rise of water
above the fordable depth may at once be evident.
