[Chap. X. Sec. 99.
2. The enemy, or a proportion, will often be mounted, and
will in any event possess great mobility. His tactics are
likely to be the usual tactics of uncivilized warriors, i.e. to
harass the flanks and rear of columns, to attempt to cut off
detached parties, transport or stragglers, to attack an ill-
protected camp or bivouac, but to avoid a general engage-
ment.
3. Aeroplanes and armoured cars are pre-eminently the
weapons to use against desert tribes (see Sec. 95). The
enemy has little concealment or cover from aeroplanes, while
the speed and fire power of armoured cars and their com-
parative independence of water give them great value
wherever the desert is hard enough for them to move freely.
Light lorries or motor-cars fitted with a machine gun or
automatic weapon are often just as effective and more
mobileÂ® than armoured cars. Infantry carried in mechanical
transport or transported by air may be employed to hold
points of tactical or strategical importance such as wells.
Every effort should in fact be used to out-do the enemy in
his asset of mobility.
If infantry are required to move on foot across open desert
country against a fanatical enemy capable of shock tactics,
such as Somalis or Sudanese, a formation in the shape of a
loose square, with the transport in the middle, may be
adopted. Perimeter camps will be used at night, as in
mountain or bush warfare.
