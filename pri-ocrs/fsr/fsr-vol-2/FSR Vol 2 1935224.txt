units and formations will be described by the authorized
abbreviations given in the Field Service Pocket Book ;
ordinal numbers written as words will be used to denote
armies, e.g. First (Second, etc.) Army. Cardinal numbers
(written as figures) will be used to denote particular forma-
tions or units (e.g. 1 Div. [lst Division], 2 R.W.K. [2nd
Battalion The Royal West Kent Regt.]). Otherwise,
numbers will be written as words, e.g. :
"Two med bys are placed under the command of 3 div."
When it is desired to refer to a unit or formation from
which a portion is excluded, the unit or formation will be
named and the words " less . . ." used, e.g. :
" 2 div less two inf bdes."
" 1 RF less two coys."
2. Officers are not expected to memorize all the authorized
abbreviations given in the Field Service Pocket Book, but

never be
used; conditional terms such as " as soon as
possible," " should," " may" are dangerous in an order or
instruction, and will only be used when it is not possible to
be definite.
