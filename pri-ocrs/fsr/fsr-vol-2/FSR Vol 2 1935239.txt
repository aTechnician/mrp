Remarks
(m7)
1. Each unit (or portion of a unit entraining separately from its parent unit) is given a serial number (see Manual
of Movement (War), 1933, Sec. 86, 5).
2. This form is adaptable to all types of troop movement by rail.
In strategic movements (sce Sec. 26), units
normally entrain complete except for M.T. vehicles, which when possible move by road.
In tactical movements,
units usually entrain with a minimum of transport; and additional columns should be interpolated after column (c
giving the entrainment strength of units in :-
1. Officers.
ii. Other ranks.
ili. Animals by types.
iv. Horse drawn vehicles by types (the actual vehicles to entrain being specified).
v. When applicable, M.T. vehicles or A.F.Vs. by types.
