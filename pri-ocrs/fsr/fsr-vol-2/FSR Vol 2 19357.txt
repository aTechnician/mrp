WHAT A SOLDIER-
WRITER SAYS
"I bought my Remington Portable
at Rawalpindi, India, in 1925,"
writes Captain Graham Hope.
"Since then it has been an in-
separable companion to me, both as
as a soldier and a writer-travelling
many thousands of miles in every
conceivable form of transport from
a railway train to a camel. It has
weathered every climate, enduring
temperatures from 115 degrees in
the shade to zero. It has absorbed
almost every foreign body known
to the East-from tropical rain to
desert sand-and seemed to like it.
It particularly enjoyed, I think, a
moth, which was lost in it in 1928
and was never seen again. It has
only been overhauled twice, and
although it is now nearing the end
of a decade of constant use, it still
seems
good for many years to
come."
