[Appendix IV.
5. Unless otherwise stated, the time and place of arrival of
a body of troops refer to the head of the main body.
II. Date
1. All orders, instructions, reports and messages must be
dated. Dates will be written in the form " 3 Sep 36," and
not in the numeral form " 3/9/36."
The names of months will be abbreviated by the use of the
first three letters.
In using the message form (A.F. C 2123) neither the
month nor the year will be inserted in the date space, which
is for the day of the month only.
2. A night will be described by both dates over which the
night extends, e.g. :
" night 29/30 Sep"
" night 30 Sep/1 Oct "
Ill. Time
1. Time will be described by reference to the 24-hour
clock. Groups of four figures followed by " hrs" will be
used.
The first two figures represent the hour and the last
two the minutes past the hour.
Example (Date-3 Sep).
" 0001 hrs" : one minute past midnight, night 2/3 Sep.
" 0900 hrs"
nine o'clock in the morning.
" 1200 hrs"
: nOOn.
" 1635 hrs" : twenty-five minutes to five in the after-
поод.
" 2400 hrs" : midnight 3,4 Sep.
The abbreviation " hrs" will not be used in the " Time of
origin" space on the message form (A.F. C 2128).
2. When plans are being drawn up which are to be carried
out in accordance with a time-table, it will be usual to base
the timings on a time known as " zero hour"; this enables
arrangements to be made in detail without the necessity of
fixing or disclosing, until it is convenient to do so, the actual
moment when the operation will begin. It will be the
responsibility of the commander who issues the orders for an
operation to define what constitutes zero hour for that
particular operation: in attack, it will normally be the hour
at which the leading troops of the attack cross their starting
line.
Zero hour will be described in accordance with the
rules in para. 1, above. Auy action to be taken before zero
