Wake up with a
Healthy Mouth
Begin the day well!
Prepare for it over-
night : give the
teeth a thorough
brushing-up-and-
down as well as
to-and-fro. Brush
out every particle
of food that can
lurk between the teeth, and at the same time
kill germs that may cling to them, for germs
secrete the acids that mean decay for the
teeth. Thirty seconds' exposure to Euthymol
Tooth Paste will do their business and leave
the mouth deliciously healthy and clean-
tasting. Never go to bed without using your
Euthymol
TOOTH PASTE
KILLS DENTAL DECAY GERMS WITHIN 30 SECONDS
