THE WATCH THAT FLEW
OVER EVEREST
In their sensational flight over Everest, all members of the
Houston Expedition were equipped with Rolex Oyster Watches.
The following extract is from the official record:
"Came the matter of watches of which any number were
submitted for our approval. We wanted a watch that would
tell the truth about time, a watch of lasting accuracy, and one
that would go if we took it up to the stratosphere or deep down
in the sea, a watch that would operate under all conditions . . .
Many were called but
only one was chosen,
the Rolex, and it did all
we asked of it.
Stainless
from £7 7s.
