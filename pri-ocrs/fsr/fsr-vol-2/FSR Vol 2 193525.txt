i. Those common to all arms.
ii. Those dealing with one arm only.
The former are bound in red, the latter in a distinctive
colour for each arm.
Table I, below, shows briefly what subject matter is dealt
with in the volumes common to all arms.
Table II gives a list of the principal manuals of each arm.
2. The manuals of the various arms are arranged as
follows :—
1. One volume deals with the training of the arm in peace
and its employment in war ; * these volumes are basec
supplement, Field Service Regulations,
Volume II,t and Training Regulations, and are
supplemented as necessary by :
ii. Volumes dealing with special subjects which concern
an individual arm alone (e.g. Artillery Training,
Volume II (Gunnery) ).
Further details are contained in the prefaces to the manuals
of each arm.
3. The scales of issue within units of all manuals are
contained in the publication "Manuals, Regulations, etc.,
Authorized Scales of Issue."
