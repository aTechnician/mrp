will command both the transport and its escort. Should he
be the commander of the escort, he will consult the senior
transport officer on all matters affecting the welfare and con-
venience of the transport, will avoid all interference with
his technical functions a so dil ive satect to the conve
would be endangered.
3. In protecting a convoy early information of the approach
of the enemy is essential in order that he may be engaged as
the convoy is following. The escort should therefore consist of
mobile troops as far as possible.
Armoured cars are particu-
larly valuable; useful substitutes may sometimes be impro-
vised from lorries; requisitioned motors may be used to
move machine guns and their crews from one important
tactical feature to another. Artillery is of value in suitable
in mechanical transport.
4. The commander of a convoy will try to avoid attracting
the enemy's attention, and will on no account engage the
enemy if his task can be accomplished without fighting. If
fighting is inevitable, the enemy will be kept as far as possible
from the convoy, which will be kept moving, unless the
existence of good cover makes it advisable to halt until the
attack is beaten off. Close protection of a convoy is usually
of little value, since, once the vehicles come under effective
fire, and animals, engines or drivers become casualties, the
whole convoy is likely to be brought to a halt.
