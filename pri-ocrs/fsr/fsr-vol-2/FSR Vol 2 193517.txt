THE BURBERRY

On
mention of this publication.
Day in and day out the
whole year round, there's
hardly a day that isn't a
"Burberry" day—a day on
which THE BURBERRY
is needed, either as a
shield against wet and
wind or as a light overcoat.
Proof without Heat and
Warm without Weight, it
keeps one dry when it
rains — warm when it's
cold — comfortable under
every conceivable change
of weather of temperature.
Airylight, THE
BURBERRY is no trouble
to wear or carry on fine
days, yet should the
weather suddenly change
from good to bad, it pro-
vides perfect protection.
