CHAPTER V
PROTECTION
37. General principles of protection
1. By protection is meant the measures which a commander
adopts to safeguard his command against being surprised and
to conceal his dispositions from the enemy; it includes pre-
cautions against observation and attack from the air and
against the risk of gas attack by an enemy, the special
measures necessary for which are dealt with in Secs. 3o and
40 respectively.
Every commander of a body of troops is at all times
responsible for its protection; this applies equally to a
division under a major-general and to a patrol under a lance-
corporal.
The use of aircraft and armoured fighting vehicles
in war has greatly extended the area over which protection
has to be maintained. Thus the lines of communication
and areas behind the fighting front are now liable to recon-
naissance and attack from the air at all times, and may in
conditions of open warfare be also liable to attack by mobile
troops.
No body of troops can be regarded as secure unless
protection is furnished in all directions from which attack
is possible, whether from the front, the flanks, the rear or
the air.
2. Adequate and timely information is one of the surest
opportunity of effecting surprise. Every commander in
his degree therefore makes arrangements for protection by in-
formation; the means which he employs may vary from the
despatch of air reconnaissances and of mobile forces by the
the commander of a large formation down to the look-out
man sent ahead by a patrol or the sentry posted by a section.
But since information can never be entirely complete nor up-
to-date (Sec. 31), protective detachments, which will protect
by resistance, while the main body is getting ready for action,
