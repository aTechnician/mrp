[Chap. II. Sec. 15.
confirming order is to be issued or not, the staff of the
commander issuing the verbal orders will ensure, before
subordinate commanders rejoin their units, that their written
conveniently be marked on maps.
Verbal orders will follow the same sequence and form as
written orders (see paragraph 4, below). Indefinite or
badly delivered verbal orders may do much to destroy con-
fid ence in success.
4. The form of an operation order may vary according to
the formation or unit which issues it, the nature of the opera-
tion, the time available and the methods of distribution at
hand. Elaboration and formalism in the writing of orders
must be avoided: orders should be confined to essentials
and should be as brief, in subject matter, in headings and in
appendices, as is consistent with clearness. But a recog-
nized form and sequence should always be followed as nearly
as practicable, since this makes important omissions less
likely, and assists subordinates, who can more easily grasp
the meaning of an order issued in a form with which they are
familiar.
The form is as follows * :-
SECRET
(Formation or Unit)
Ref. Map
Operation Order No..
Copy No.
Date
INFORMATION.-
Regarding the enemy.â€”A summary of the information on
which the plan is based, so far as the recipients require to know
Regarding our own troops.- A summary of the situation
and intentions of any neighbouring troops, whose action may
affect the action of the recipient of the order. A higher
commander's intention will be repeated in the orders of
subordinates only when, and so far as, it is essential to do so.
* An operation order sent by telegraph or wireless should be in the form
given in Appendix IV, Sec. V, 16.
