CHAPTER V
THE OFFENSIVE BATTLE
(See also Field Service her Wations, Vol. II, 1935,
17. Envelopment and penetration
1. The commander who, after weighing up the factors
outlined in Chapter III, has decided, on or before gaining
contact with the enemy, that he will adopt the offensive,
will usually be faced with the alternatives of attempting to
envelop one or both of the hostile flanks, or of penetrating
the enemy's front at one or more points. Sometimes a
combination of envelopment and penetration may appear
to offer the best prospects of success. Much will depend on
the disposition in which his forces approach the battlefield,
i.e. on a broad front or in depth (Sec. 10). If the army is
already disposed on a broad front and the dispositions of
the enemy have been correctly estimated, it may be suffi-
cient simply to continue the forward movement, the outer
columns wheeling inward against the enemy's flanks when
located.
If, however, the force is more concentrated, or if
the original disposition has been made on a miscalculated
estimate of the enemy's movements and intentions, con-
siderable movement of troops may be necessary before the
enemy's flanks can be found and enveloped.
Sometimes
two forces that have advanced to the battlefield from
different directions may be able to unite on the battlefield,
one force attacking the enemy in front and one in flank.
Such a man≈ìuvre, however,
requires careful timing to
avoid the risk of defeat in detail.
2. The successful envelopment of an enemy's flank has
usually a decisive result: it avoids his prepared defences,
upsets his plans, threatens his rear organization and line of
withdrawal and may exercise a destructive effect on his
