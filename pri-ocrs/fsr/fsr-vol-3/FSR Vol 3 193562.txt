CHAPTER VI
THE DEFENSIVE BATTLE
(See also Field Service Regulations, Vol. II, 1935,
Chapter VII)
24. General considerations
1. An outline of the advantages and disadvantages of the
defence, especially of the psychological factors involved, has
been given in Sec. 11. The conditions in which a com-
mander may engage in a defensive battle are various. He
may take up a position and invite attack as part of a
deliberate plan to win the battle by a counter-offensive; or
he may wish to gain time for the arrival of reinforcements
with which he hopes to take the offensive and defeat the
enemy; or his aim may simply be to contain an enemy
force while a decisive success is being sought elsewhere by
another force or by another part of the same force; or he
may be thrown on the defensive by inferiority in numbers
or in readiness or in training. His aim may therefore be
to obtain a decision, to postpone a decision or to prevent
the enemy obtaining a decision.
2. The chief difference in method between fighting a
defensive battle in which a decision is sought and one in
from obtaining a decision lies in the size, purpose and hand-
ling of the general reserve held in the hands of the com-
mander of the whole force. The type of battle in which a
decision is sought by a predetermined counter-stroke
which is really an offensive and not a defensive battle
requires that as large a part of the force as possible is held
in hand for the offensive (Sec. 26). When the aim is to
gain time for the arrival of reinforcements or of another
force, those reinforcements or that other force may con-
stitute the general reserve for offensive action, and the
reserve held by the commander of the original force will be
