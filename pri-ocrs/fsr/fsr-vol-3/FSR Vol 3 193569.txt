is offered in the course of a battle by a mistake of the enemy,
is more difficult still to execute where large forces are engaged.

orders issued and the force put in movement, the propitious
moment may have gone; unless armoured troops that can
strike quickly and effectively are available.
5. The actual counter-stroke, when made, is conducted
in the same way as the decisive attack in an offensive battle
(Sec. 19). Armoured troops such as tank brigades will be
of special value, since their mobility and fire power will
facilitate surprise.
