[Chap. V. Sec. 23.
23. The air force in an offensive battle
1. The main tasks of the air force in an attack are sum-
marized in Field Service Regulations, Vol. II, 1935, Sec. 66.
A special task may often be to locate, to delay and to dis-
organize the enemy reserves. Victory will often depend on
the ability of the attacker to complete the break-through of
the enemy's defensive organization before reserves can arrive
from other portions of the battlefield to close the breach.
Such reserves may approach by march, by mechanical
transport or by rail, and the air force may by attack cause
such delay and disorganization as will decide the battle.
Other suitable targets for attack may be enemy head-
quarters, if located as such, and centres of communication.
Selection of the right time to attack requires as much judg-
ment as selection of the right objective; it will, for instance,
usually be advisable to defer attack on a line of communi-
cation (such as a railway) until the enemy is definitely com-
mitted to that line.
2. Reconnoitring aircraft should be instructed to watch
the movement on the roads in rear of the enemy. The
hrst signs of an intention by the enemy to retire is often
given by a backward movement of rear organizations and
transport.
The air force, by offensive action against a retreating
enemy,
may sometimes be able to turn an orderly with-
drawal into a rout. Low-flying attack may be effective in
such circumstances, since the enemy's morale is likely to
be poor, and, owing to the probable absence of organized
anti-aircraft fire, casualties to the
aircraft are likely to be
small.
The commander of a mobile force sent to intercept the
enemy's line of retreat should have some aircraft working
directly under his control.
