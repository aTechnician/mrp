5. If the enemy is using gas, his methods of attack with
it will vary as the troops come into close contact. Air spray
on forward troops will be unlikely owing to the uncertainty
as to the area that may be contaminated: main bodies or
reserves, large concentrations of transport, bivouac areas
and rear organizations may still be subjected to this form
of attack. As deployment takes place and main bodies
come into contact, other methods of employing gas may
be encountered. In view, however, of the difficulties of
getting forward large supplies of ammunition and special
material, it is unlikely that heavy concentrations will be
met; though projector attacks on limited areas may be
expected. Details of the enemy's methods, of the nature
of the gas encountered, and of the localities in which it is
being used will give valuable indications of the enemy's
intentions, and should be reported at once.
