7. Should a paymaster refuse to make a payment by
reason of alleged irregularity, the case will normally be
referred to the D.A.G., who, if he considers that the
objection should be overruled, will so inform the pay-
master-in-chief (Sec. 189). The latter, if he considers
the matter important enough, may require it to be
referred to the C.-in-C. When such an objection is
made by a paymaster at a distance from the base who
is not in touch with the paymaster-in-chief, payment will
be made only on urgent military grounds under the
written order of a formation commander. The order for
payment will explain briefly the objections to delaying
payment pending the decision of the D.A.G.
In all such cases the officer who overrules a paymaster
renders himself personally responsible for the expendi-
ture in question.
In accordance with the Financial Instructions the
paymaster-in-chief will, if necessary, report cases falling
under this paragraph departmentally to the accounting
officer (the Permanent Under-Secretary of State) at the
War Office, sending copies to the officer concerned and
the financial adviser. (See Sec. 199, 8.)
193. General instructions to imprest holders
1. Regular imprest holders are usually officers
commanding squadrons, batteries, troops or companies,
adjutants and officers of the services.
