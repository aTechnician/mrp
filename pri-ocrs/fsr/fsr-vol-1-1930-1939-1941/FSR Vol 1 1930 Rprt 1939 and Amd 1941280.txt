occupied in the near future, all unburnt refuse will be
buried, and latrines, urinals and pits filled in on leaving

1. Horses should be picketed facing away from the
pines anim is should be permetent rom the permanent
front and rear by earth or mud walls not less than 3 ft.
6 in. in height, with occasional traverses.
2. A horse, when picketed, requires a frontage of
about 5 ft., and a distance of 4 yards.
3. A gangway of 5 yards will be maintained between
two horse lines, and between a horse line and the nearest
building, wall, &c., or the pegs of the nearest tent.
4. Saddlery and harness will be placed in the gangways
in rear of the animals.
5. Head ropes will be fastened at such a length as to
be just slack when the horse is standing naturally.
6. If horses are unaccustomed to picketing, the men
should be kept as much as possible among them.
156. Parking guns and vehicles
Sufficient distance should be kept clear in front of
guns and vehicles to allow of individual vehicles being
drawn out of line easily.
A distance of 12 yards is sufficient to allow of this for
a vehicle and six horse team.
