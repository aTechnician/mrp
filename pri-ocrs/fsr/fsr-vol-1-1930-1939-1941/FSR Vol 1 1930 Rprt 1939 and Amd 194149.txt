[Chap. III, Sec. 13.
(a) The A.G.'s branch deals with personnel.
(b) The Q.M.G.'s branch deals with movement,
subject to its direction by the general
staff in the actual execution of military
operations, with accommodation, animals
and supplies; and with engineer, trans-
portation and veterinary stores.
It also
deals with the provision, maintenance, and
operation of general mechanical transport
vehicles driven by R.A.S.C. personnel.
(c) The M.G.O.'s branch deals with research,
experiment, design, provision and mainten-
ance in connection with all ordnance stores
(see page xviii for definition) and certai
engineer stores for the signal service.
It also deals with research, design and
experiment in connection with those
mechanical vehicles which are provided,
maintained and operated by the Q.M.G.'s
branch.
5. The distribution of staff work described above is the
more necessary at the headquarters of higher formations,
where the volume of work and the demand for special
qualifications are greater than with subordinate forma-
tions. Below G.H.Q., the A.G.'s, Q.M.G.'s and
M.G.O.'s branches are amalgamated in degrees varying
with each formation. Administrative staff officers
in the lower formations will not, therefore, in all cases
be considered as belonging to one particular branch of
the staff. In such formations the allocation of work is
made at the discretion of the senior administrative
staff officer of the headquarters concerned.
