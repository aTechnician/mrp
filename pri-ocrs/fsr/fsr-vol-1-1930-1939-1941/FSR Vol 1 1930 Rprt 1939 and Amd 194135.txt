CHAPTER II
COMMAND
5. The responsibilities of command
1. A command in war is an appointment which
involves complete responsibility for the training and
leadership of fighting troops, and for the efficiency and
maintenance of those troops.
2. This responsibility is exercised by a commander
with the help of various officers, some of whom con-
stitute his staff, and through subordinate commanders
who are usually assisted in a similar way.
3. In the event of casualty the next senior will assume
temporary command, until confirmed or relieved, but
the permanent appointment to fill a vacancy is in no
way the right of the next senior.
4. The final authority for permanent appointments
to commands in the field is the King, on the advice of
the responsible ministers. Such appointments are
notified in the London Gazette.
6. The commander-in-chief
1. The command of the forces in the field is vested
in the commander-in-chief, who is appointed by the
King on the advice of the Cabinet. His authority is
supreme in all matters within the area of his command
