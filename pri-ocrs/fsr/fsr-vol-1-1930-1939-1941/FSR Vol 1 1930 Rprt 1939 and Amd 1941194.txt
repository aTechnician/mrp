MATERIAL
92. General principles
1. The principles on which the issue of material is
made to formations and units, to replace wastage or for
the military development of the theatre of operations,
has been dealt with in Chapter XI.
2. The smooth working of the organization for the
maintenance of the troops is dependent on close co-
operation between the user or consumer, the providing
service and the transporting agency. While the user
and provider of any class of material remain the same
throughout the theatre of operations, the transporting
agency passes through different forms, and under the
technical control of different services, according to the
part of the theatre of war through which a given store is
being transported. The technical control of the trans-
portation service extends from base ports to, and
includes, railhead or riverhead. Beyond this point,
the transport agency normally changes to road transport,
and is directly under the control of the staff, without
the interposition of an executive service.
