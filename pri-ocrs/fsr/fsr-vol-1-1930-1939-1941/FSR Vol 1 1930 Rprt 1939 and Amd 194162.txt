into the three categories of operations, intelligence
and staff duties and training, it is not necessary in all
formations to organize it in three separate sections.
In the lower formations of corps and division the
duties of the three sections may be distributed among
the general staff officers on the headquarters' establish-
ment as may be most convenient. At army head-
quarters, and still more at G.H.Q., it will be advan-
tageous for the general staff to be organized as described
in para. 6, above.
19. The operations section
1. The head of the operations section is responsible
for studying
continuously the situation in the light of
all available information, and for bringing to the notice
of the senior general staff officer any factors which may
affect the course of operations. The head of the
operations section must also be prepared to submit
proposals regarding measures to be adopted.
As soon as the senior general staff officer has received
the commander's orders regarding the action to be taken,
the head of the operations section 1s responsible
for drafting orders and instructions for the issue of
which the general staff is responsible and for obtaining
and including in them such paragraphs as have to be
compiled by the other branches and by the artillery,
engineers, &c.
Instructions regarding the drafting and issuing of
orders are given in Volume II.
Graphs (Appendix II) are of great assistance in
working out and checking calculations for movements and
concentrations, whether by road, rail or ship.
