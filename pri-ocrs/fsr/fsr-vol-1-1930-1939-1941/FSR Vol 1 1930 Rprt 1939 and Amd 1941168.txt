5. The military transportation service as well as 2nd Nov., 1941
and 3rd line transport will be at the disposal (on repay-
ment) of the Officer i/c Expeditionary Force Institutes
for the maintenance of canteen stocks, but only to the
extent that the Q.M.G.'s branch of the staff consider
consistent with the demands of other user services. The
importance to morale of maintaining an efficient canteen
service for the troops will not be lost sight of.

to the military situation as a whole, it will be permissible
for any supplies or material, common to the canteen and
other services, to be issued on repayment to the canteen
service, if this procedure is essential to the maintenance
of an efficient canteen service. Similarly, canteen stocks
and material may be purchased or requisitioned in ex-
ceptional circumstances for the maintenance of troops
in the field.

wholly, or in part, organized according to the conditions
