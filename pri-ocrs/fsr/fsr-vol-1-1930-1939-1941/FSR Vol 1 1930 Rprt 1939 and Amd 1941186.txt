The construction and development of the
road communication system is the respon-
sibility of the works service (see Sec. 80).
When road transport is needed to supplement or re-
place railways or I.W.T. on the lines of communication,
it will come under the jurisdiction of the movement con-
trol, and to that extent its employment will be the con-
cern of the Director General of Transportation. Its
technical maintenance and operation will remain the
responsibility of the Director of Supplies and Transport.
8. Base depots will, in principle, be situated in the
vicinity of base ports. If several base ports are in use
which can all conveniently transmit imports to one
group of base depots, then but one set of base depots
will be established. If such base ports are too widely
separated to allow of this method being followed
economically, it may be necessary to construct and estab-
lish two or more groups of base depots, each group being
affiliated to the port, or ports, best situated to serve it.
A group of base depots forms a " Base."
9. Advanced depots will only be established in the
following circumstances :-
i. When it is impossible for any reason to supply
railheads or riverheads direct from base
depots satisfactorily.
ii. When the supply of railheads or riverheads
direct from base depots is uncertain, because
the lines of communication between base depots
and railheads or riverheads is liable to inter-
ruption, either by enemy action, or by climatic
conditions, or by reason of some technical
weakness.
