In practice all three zones must overlap to a certain
extent owing to the necessity of maintaining a complete
transport system for evacuation between the units in
the most suitable and convenient form.
113. Medical establishment of units
1. Medical officers are attached to the headquarters of
units as shown in war establishments. Each medical
officer is provided by the unit with a non-commissioned
officer as medical orderly. The medical equipment is
carried in a maltese cart, limbered G.S. wagon, or light
motor van.
2. In those units which may have need of stretchers
in war, certain personnel are trained as regimental
stretcher-bearers (see para. 801, King's Regulations,
1935). This personnel, which will be specially detailed
for the duty of giving first aid to the wounded in action,
will be distinguished by a stretcher-bearer armlet,
lettered " S.B." worn on the left arm.
3. When an action is expected the regimenta
stretcher-bearers are placed under the orders of the
unit medical officer. Their duties are :-
i. To afford first aid to the wounded.
ii. To carry cases not able to walk to the regimental
aid post (see Sec. 114) or to the nearest cover.
iii. To throw up or find cover to protect serious
cases which cannot be moved at the time.
4. Medical arrangements for units on the establish-
ment of which no medical officer is provided will be
made by the D.G.M.S. through his representatives at
the headquarters of formations.
