5. Ordnance stores, other than ammunition, will
normally be despatched to railhead by pack trains,
packed for and addressed to individual units.
Thence they will be conveyed by the transport of
maintenance companies to refilling points (except in the
case of mechanically-propelled vehicles which will be
dealt with as in Sec. 97, 2), special transport vehicles
being provided when necessary.
At reflling points they will be taken over by the
supply companies and issued to units at delivery points.
In special circumstances certain articles such as clothing
and necessaries, cleaning materials, horse shoes, &c.,
may be consigned in bulk to the D.A.D.O.S. of the forma-
tion; in such cases these bulk supplies will be taken
over by the supply companies. A supply officer will
make arrangements with the D.A.D.O.S. for the subse-
quent delivery of the stores to units.
109. Special vegulations affecting supplies on voyages
1. The field service scale of rations will take effect on
the arrival of troops in a theatre of operations.
2. On long voyages troops on board ship are normally
rationed under Board of Trade arrangements. For
short voyages rations for the duration of the voyage
will be brought by troops from their place of mobiliza-
tion, as laid down in Regulations for Mobilization.
Forage for consumption on board ship will in all
cases be supplied under arrangements made by the War
Office.
