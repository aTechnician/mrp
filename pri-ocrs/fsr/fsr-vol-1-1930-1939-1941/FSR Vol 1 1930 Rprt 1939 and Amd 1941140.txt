2. The duties and responsibilities of a represen-
tative are similar to those of a head of a service, but
are limited by the technical and financial policy of the
head of a service. Should a commander call upon them
to undertake any service which necessitates their exceed-
ing their powers thus defined, and the emergency does
not admit of prior reference to the head of the service,
the written instructions of the commander are sufficient
authority (Sec. 7, 2). A copy of these instructions
will be passed at once to the head of the service by his
representative. In all other cases where a representa-
tive exceeds his powers either financially or technically
the responsibility for justification will rest with the
representative.
3. Where no representative is shown on a headquarter
establishment the senior officer of the service in the
formation or area is the representative of the head of
the service.
64. Grades of heads of services and their representatives
A director-general will be the head of a service who
is responsible for co-ordinating the technical methods
of two or more kindred services, and he will exercise
general financial supervision.
A director will be the head of a service with personal
financial responsibility for all expenditure on the
operation of his service.
Representatives of directors in subordinate formations
are styled deputy directors, assistant directors and
deputy assistant directors.
