of a site. Once established, G.H.Q. will not be moved
unless decisive changes in the military situation render
a change of location imperative.
3. To a less degree the considerations which govern
the location of G.H.Q. apply to an army headquarters,
and the latter should therefore be moved as seldom as
possible.
4. In the case of a corps or divisional headquarters,
it will often be convenient for the commander to occupy
an " operations headquarters" for the duration of a
special operation with a portion of his staff, while leaving
the remainder at " headquarters."
In such cases,
each branch of the staff will leave representatives to
act for it at " headquarters."
5. When an operations headquarters is formed it will
be kept as small as possible. Its position, and the
hour at which it will open, will be notified to both
superior and subordinate formations. The commander
will normally be accompanied at operations headquarters
by the senior staff officers of each branch, who will leave
representatives to act for them at headquarters. All
correspondence of a routine nature, and correspondence
on administrative subjects not having an immediate
bearing on operations in progress, will be addressed to
headquarters. Only correspondence on the conduct
of operations in progress and on administrative matters
having a direct bearing on them will be addressed
to operations headquarters, in the latter case a duplicate
copy being despatched simultaneously to headquarters.
