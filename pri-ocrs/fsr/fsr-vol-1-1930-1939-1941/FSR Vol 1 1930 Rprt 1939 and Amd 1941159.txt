[Chap. XII, Sec. 73.
73. Postal service
1. The postal service with the army will be responsible
for establishing and working a postal system for the
carriage of official and private correspondence and
parcels for the benefit of the forces in the field, including
foreign attaches
and civilians employed by, or
accompanying, the army. It will also carry in the
theatre of operations the traffic dealt with by the
military forwarding organization (see Sec. 30, 4, vi).
2. The head of the service will be the Director of
Postal Services (D. Post.). He will be represented at
headquarters of armies, corps, divisions, and L. of C.
areas.
3. The personnel of the service will be provided by the
army postal corps which is drawn on mobilization from
the Supplementary Reserve, Royal Engineers.
4. The service will be organized in a base post office,
auxiliary postal companies (for the L. of C.) and G.H.Q.
corps, divisional and cavalry divisional postal units.
Personnel of postal units will be attached to R.A.S.C.
railhead supply detachments, maintenance companies
and supply companies (as well as to G.H.Q., and head-
quarters of formations), so that mails will reach the
troops by the same system as supplies.
The war establishments of postal units show the
distribution of personnel.
Any post offices required in divisional, cavalry
divisional, corps or G.H.Q. areas, over and above
those at the formation headquarters, will be staffed
out of the postal unit (allotted to the formation) at
the discretion of the postal officer concerned.
