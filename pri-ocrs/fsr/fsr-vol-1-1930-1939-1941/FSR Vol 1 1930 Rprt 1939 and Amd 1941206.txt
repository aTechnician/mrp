In such circumstances any one link may be utilized to
carry out the duties normally allotted to two links,
or even in special circumstances to three links. Care
must be taken to effect any necessary adjustment of
personnel, other than that of the transport service,
so that the duties normally carried out by the link
eliminated may be satisfactorily performed by the
remaining links. This adjustment may entail the
temporary transfer from one link to another of supply
personnel in the case of supplies, or of other personnel
in the case of ammunition.
Before ordering variations of this nature in the normal
chain of supply the commanders of road transport units
will be consulted. The object of such variations will
be to give additional facilities where possible to com-
manders of transport units to overhaul vehicles and to
rest drivers or to carry special consignments of stores
(Sec. 104). With this object in view it may at one
time be advisable to eliminate the third line transport,
at others the second or first line transport. Before
ordering such variations, therefore, it will normally
be necessary for superior and subordinate formation
commanders to arrive at an agreement in the matter.
