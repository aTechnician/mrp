of his branch.
17. Location of G.H.Q. and of the headquarters of
formations
1. In the case of the larger formations the volume of
work to be carried out by both the staff and representa-
tives of services is so great that headquarters can be
moved only at the risk of serious dislocation. While
this may be true very occasionally of a corps head-
quarters, it is more frequently the case with army head-
quarters, and always with G.H.Q.
Special measures are therefore necessary to ensure
continuity of work in both army headquarters and of
G.H.Q., especially during mobile warfare. When cir-
cumstances render it necessary an advanced head-
quarters, termed " operations headquarters," may be
opened. Such a step should not be undertaken without
fully weighing the disadvantages caused by the neces-
sary sub-division of staff, the difficulties of communica-
tions (including signal communications), and the
possibility that vital information may be received at the
rear headquarters and on retransmission to the operations
headquarters arrive too late for action.
2. In the first instance G.H.Q. will be established at
some place in rear of the probable scene of active opera-
tions well suited to the exigencies of control throughout
the theatre of operations. Questions of security of
telegraphic and telephonic communications against
interruption by enemy action and of adequate accom-
modation will be the dominating factors in the selection
