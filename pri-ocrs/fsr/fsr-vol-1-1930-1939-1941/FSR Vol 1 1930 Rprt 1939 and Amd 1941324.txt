ing arrangements are impossible, the provision of meals
may be made by means of agreements on A.F. F 706.
Resort to this method of meal provision will be most
exceptional and made only on the authority of a respon-
sible officer. The arrangements made will in all cases
be the most economical available for providing meals
not exceeding the standard of feeding adopted for the
army generally.
The form will be prepared in duplicate and receipts
given to the supplier for the number of meals supplied.
On completion of the agreement the number of meals
provided will be certified on the back of the form, the
original copy of the form being left with the supplier of
meals, who will forward the copy, supported by receipts,
to the command paymaster at the base, for settlement.
The duplicate will be forwarded by the officer or unit to
the same source as a verification of the information given
on the original.
180. Contributions of money
1. Contributions of money can be demanded only in
order to meet the needs of the army or of the administra-
tion of occupied territory. The collection of such con-
tributions will be effected, as far as is possible, in accord-
ance with the legal basis and assessment of taxes in force
at the time.
The collection will, when practicable, be made
through the civil authorities usually responsible for the
collection of taxes, and for every contribution a receipt
will be given to the contributors.
