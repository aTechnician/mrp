claims to pension by the individual or his dependants, care should
be taken when completing this form to give the fullest possible
details concerning the circumstances of the injury, particularly
as regards the degree of negligence or misconduct, if any.
The commander of the formation concerned will invariably
endorse the form to show whether a court of inquiry has been held.
