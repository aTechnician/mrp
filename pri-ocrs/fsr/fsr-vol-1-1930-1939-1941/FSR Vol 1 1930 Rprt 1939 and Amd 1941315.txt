[Chap. XIX, Sec. 177.
177. Requisition of goods, animals, transport and labour
1. Requisition will be subject to the following con-
ditions :-
i. It will be confined to the actual necessities of the
army.
ii. It will be in proportion to the resources of a
district.
iii. It is not to involve inhabitants in the obligation
to take part in any military operation against
their country.
iv. In the case of food supplies a quantity sufficient
for the immediate needs of the inhabitants
will be left for their use. The amount to be
left will be decided by the authority making
the requisition, but normally three days'
supply for households and rather more in the
case of outlying farms or villages will suffice.
2. On mobilization a " central payment office for
requisitions" will be formed under the paymaster-in-
chief. Its duties will comprise the registration, verifica-
tion and payment of all requisitioning services in the
theatre of operations. Sub-offices may be opened as
necessary. Heads of services will, however, be em-
powered to settle such requisitioning claims within their
own province as are unlikely to involve questions of
dual payment or to necessitate future reconsideration.
A record of such transactions will be sent to the central
payment office for requisitions for registration and it will
be clearly stated thereon that no further action need
be taken.
