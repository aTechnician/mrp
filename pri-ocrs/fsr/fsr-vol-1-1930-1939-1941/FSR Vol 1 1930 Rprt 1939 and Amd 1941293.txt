[Chap. XVII, Sec. 163.
iv. The various points at which loaded ammunition
vehicles are located, for the purpose of
supplying units, are termed " ammunition
points (A.Ps.)." The position of ammunition
points will be determined by the staff, and
notified to units in orders or by direct liaison
from rear to front. The number of ammuni-
tion points within a formation should be kept
to a minimum.
v. Motor cyclist orderlies are provided on the
establishment of the headquarters of the
divisional ammunition company for the
collection of demands. When operations are
imminent, these orderlies will be sent to
report to the headquarters of the divisional
cavalry regiment, artillery brigades and
infantry brigades, whence they will be
distributed as required. They will carry
demands direct to the nearest ammunition
point, and act as guides to the loaded ammuni-
tion vehicles sent forward to delivery points
in satisfaction of those demands. Where
possible, demands should be consolidated in
order to reduce to a minimum the uneconomic
use of transport.
vi. In the case of artillery, brigade or group com-
manders will be responsible for controlling the
expenditure of ammunition, and for co-
ordinating the demands of batteries for
replacement. Batteries will, therefore, sub-
mit their demands to their brigade or group
headquarters.
