153. Watering arrangements
1. The military police, or the first troops to arrive at
a halting ground, will mount sentries on all water likely
to be required for use in order to prevent pollution.
These sentries will not be withdrawn until permanent
water guards are detailed.
2. The water supply will be selected in conjunction
with the responsible medical officer.
3. If water is obtained from a stream horses will be
watered below the place where troops obtain their
drinking water, but above bathing and washing places.
Patrolling by mounted men will often be necessary for
some distance above the spot where the drinking water is
drawn.
4. The water supply will usually be marked with
flags by the advanced party of engineers :â€”
White for drinking water.
Blue for watering places for animals.
Red for washing or bathing places.
5. If running water is not available, a rough barbed
wire fence, or some other form of fencing must be placed
round the water supply to keep out animals, which
should be watered by bucket or from improvised troughs.
Washing will be allowed only at some distance from the
water supply, empty biscuit tins, or other receptacles,
being used to draw water for this purpose.
Similar precautions are often necessary for running
water, if other bodies of troops are halted lower down
the stream.
Sites must also be allotted for washing, &c., of
mechanical vehicles.
