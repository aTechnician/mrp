CHAPTER XII
ORGANIZATION OF THE SERVICES
61. General principles
1. The supervision and direction by the staff of the
work of the services, subject to the policy laid down by
a principal staff officer (see Sec. 15) is limited to matters
of a general nature (see Sec. 14) to ensure co-ordination
between the work of the services and the requirements
and demands of the fighting troops and between the
work of the several services themselves.
Under this general supervision the head of a service,
or his representative on the headquarter establishment
of a formation or on the L. of C., is free to make all
arrangements for carrying out the duties of his service
within the bounds of the policy laid down by a principal
staff officer. The extent to which a head of a service,
or his representative, will deal with branches of the
staff, other than that given in Sec. 56, as normally
responsible for supervision, will be decided by the
principal staff officer concerned.
2. Subject to the powers of interposition vested in the
C-in-C. and the principal staff officers (Sec. 6, 3) and in
subordinate commanders (Sec. 7, 2), the head of a service
is responsible for the technical and financial methods
employed in carrying out the work of his service. By
delegation of authority from the head of a service his
representatives with the headquarters of formations
and on the L. of C. discharge similar responsibility
