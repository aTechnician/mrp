show the classification and arm of the service for which
remounts are required.
In case of emergency, units may indent direct on the
nearest remount depot, or on the nearest representative
of the director of remounts, sending copies of their
indents to their formation headquarters.
9. Drafts to meet indents will normally be despatched
direct from depots, or advanced depot if established,
to a specially selected railhead or riverhead. The
movement, as in the case of that of personnel, will be
arranged mutually between the commander of the
depot concerned and the local representative of the
movement section. Animals on arrival at railhead will
be taken over by the representative of the director of
remounts at the headquarters of the formation in whose
area the railhead is situated, and distributed by animal
convoys direct to units. Arrangements for these con-
voys, including the supply of convoy personnel, will be
made by formation commanders.
Animals sent forward from remount depots to replace
casualties will be equipped as follows :-
i. Cavalry riding horses full saddlery.
ii. All other animals
-halter (complete with
rope), nosebag and rug
(if issued).
10. Alternatively when rail or inland water transport
cannot be arranged for remounts, drafts of animals may
proceed direct by convoy from depots to points in
the areas of formations where distribution is effected.
These convoys may require the establishment of a
permanent chain of animal staging camps at points
