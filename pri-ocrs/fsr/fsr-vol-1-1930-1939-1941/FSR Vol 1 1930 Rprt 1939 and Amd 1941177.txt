[Chap. XIII, Sec. 84.
formation concerned will be charged with the special duty
of meeting the intelligence requirements of the air force.
(Sec. 22, 5, i.) These officers will work in the closest
co-operation with the air force officers responsible for
intelligence duties at the headquarters of the air force
formations concerned.
4. The army is responsible for the construction and
maintenance of signal communication between the
headquarters of military formations and the head-
quarters of air force units allotted to them. Communica-
tions, other than wireless, required between the head-
quarters of air force formations and units will also be
provided by the army.
5. If an army co-operation squadron is detached
from a corps to one of its divisions, measures must be
taken to establish reliable communication between the
headquarters of the division and the squadron aerodrome.
Communication may be facilitated, in certain circum-
stances, by the establishment of an advanced landing
ground.
The commander of the wing to which the
squadron belongs will be responsible for supplying the
squadron from corps headquarters with all necessary
information. But this information should be supple-
mented by speedy and reliable communication between
the division and the squadron. In these circumstances,
it will be of material assistance for an air force liaison
officer to be attached to the headquarters of the division.
6. In the case of an army co-operation squadron
attached to a cavalry division or a division operating
directly under the orders of G.H.Q., special arrange-
ments will be made as regards its intelligence require-
ments.
