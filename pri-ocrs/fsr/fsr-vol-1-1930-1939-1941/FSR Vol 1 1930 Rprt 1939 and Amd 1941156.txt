The rank and file of the corps will be drawn from the
following sources :
i. Men physically unfit for combatant or service
units in the field.
ii. Men specially enlisted for the labour corps.
iii. Men enrolled on a civilian basis in a theatre of
operations.
iv. Prisoners of war.
4. The unit of the service is the labour company.
Labour companies are, as far as possible, organized
homogeneously to the end that personnel of each of the
different categories mentioned in the preceding paragraph
and personnel of each different nationality or religion
in category (iii) are kept together by companies. In
addition, for special purposes companies may be
organized having special trade qualifications.
Labour companies are grouped into labour groups,
each under a labour group headquarters, which provide
the highest executive labour organization in the field.
â€¢ Labour companies of enlisted personnel, while their
primary duty is labour, are available for fighting should
the necessity arise. For this reason a proportion of each
military labour company of British personnel will be
armed. Other labour companies will not be armed.
The documents to be maintained and returns, etc., to
be submitted for enlisted personnel of the labour corps
will be the same as for personnel of other corps.
In the case of non-enlisted labour personnel a record
of service will be kept for each individual by the repre-
sentative of the service.
See Sec. 186, 9, for the particulars which must be
kept of each individual.
