CHAPTER X
SYSTEM OF PROVIDING AND
MAINTAINING PERSONNEL IN
THE FIELD
50. First reinforcements and subsequent veinforcements
1. The establishment of the reserve to be maintained
in peace is calculated on the numbers required on
mobilization to raise units to war establishment and to
replace wastage in the field until such time as recruits en-
listed on the outbreak of war are fit to proceed overseas.
In order that there shall be no delay in replacing
losses in units, a pool of reinforcements equivalent to
a fortnight's or a month's losses, dependent on the dis-
tance of the theatre of war from this country and upon
the estimated rate of wastage, will accompany the
force when it proceeds overseas. These are called
" First reinforcements" and their numbers are shown
in detail in war establishments.
2. The numbers of subsequent reinforcements required
will vary with the distance of the theatre of operations
from home depots and the progress of the campaign,
but the principles on which the supply of reinforcements
will be arranged are as follows :â€”
i. The C.-in-C., through the D.A.G., will arrange
with the home authorities the reserve of
personnel to be maintained in base depots in
the theatre of operations.
