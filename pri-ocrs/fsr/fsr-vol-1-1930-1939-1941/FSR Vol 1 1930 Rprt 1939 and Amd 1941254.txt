for forward supply. The necessary arrangements, so far
as rail or inland waterway is concerned, will be made
with the local representatives of the movement control.
Captured material collected by the troops into salvage
dumps may require a special organization for its evacua-
tion.
3. Transport returning empty from front to rear may
be used to bring back material which has been collected.
4. Special salvage is organized by G.H.Q. or army
headquarters and carried out under the supervision of
formation or area headquarters. It is undertaken for
the specific purpose of clearing expended or captured
material from battlefields, or stores from areas evacuated
by the fighting troops. Salvage parties specially
organized, provided with the necessary transport, and
detailed to definite areas are normally required for this
work.
5. Special measures are also required for the recovery
of mechanical transport vehicles. (See Sec. 97.)
139. Salvage sorting
1. Material collected into dumps, either by the methods
of routine or special salvage, will be sorted into two
categories :â€”
i. Material to be evacuated in accordance with the
principles laid down in Sec. 136.
ii. Material which it would be false economy to
evacuate.
2. The sorting of salvage requires the expert assistance
of the services, each service advising with respect to the
material for the provision of which it is responsible.
