[Chap. XIV, Sec. 99.
The number of refilling points required will depend
upon the distribution of the formations to be served.
Under tavourable conditions one refilling point for each
division will suffice, but to reduce the mileage run by
transport it may be advisable to select separate refilling
points for brigades, especially in the case of supplies.
This will frequently be necessary for cavalry formations.
Refilling points are of two kinds, " ammunition" and
" supply."
It is normally the duty of commanders of divisions to
select refilling points, but cases may arise in which these
points must be fixed by corps commanders.
When it is not possible to fix refilling points in time
for third line transport to proceed direct to them, it is
the duty of the corps commander to fix a " Rendezvous "
to which third line transport will be ordered to proceed
in the first instance and where it will be met at a pre-
arranged hour by officers of second line transport, who
will act as guides to refilling points.
Delivery points will be numerous and of necessity
widely distributed, in order to meet varied require-
ments in respect of the different categories of material.
It is the duty of unit commanders to fix delivery points
and to advise all concerned of their location in advance.
Between refilling points and delivery points, " meet-
ing points " will be selected at which guides from each
unit will meet the second line transport and conduct it
to delivery points. It is the duty of commanders of
brigades or of the areas in which the division is disposed
to select these meeting points.
