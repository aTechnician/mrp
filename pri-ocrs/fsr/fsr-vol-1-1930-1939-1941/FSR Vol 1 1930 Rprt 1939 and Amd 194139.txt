[Chap. II, Secs. 8 and 9.
ii. Administrative arrangements in the theatre of
operations, which are the responsibility of
the C.-in-C.
9. Administrative arrangements made by the home
authorities
1. The various Departments of State are responsible
for all executive administrative action necessary to
give effect to the decisions of His Majesty's Government.
Each department in its own sphere of action is solely
responsible for the methods employed, but in war
few administrative arrangements concern the work
of one department only and the greater part of the
action taken will be the result of inter-departmental
consultation.
2. Such joint action includes the definition of geo-
graphical limits of various theatres of operations, in so
far as they are not determined by the actual operation in
progress or in contemplation, and the determination of
the scale of reserves of men, animals, and material, to be
maintained for each. It
includes also the executive
action necessary for the conveyance of every require-
ment to the theatres of operations, and, in the case of
a large war, the provision of much of the material
required by the forces in the field by purchase in home
and overseas markets.
3. The Army Council is responsible for dealing with
all appointments to commands and the staff, for changes
in organization, for deciding the scale of rations for
man and animal, and for the rate and order of replenish-
ment of all categories of reserves of men, of animals
and of material.
