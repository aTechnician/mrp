should be inserted in the margin of the graph, each
opposite their respective mileage from the main starting
point.
The starting times of units are found by drawing
lines representing the rate of movement to intersect
the line of the unit starting point as already explained
in para. 4, above.
The rate of movement of the field brigade R.A.,
marching independently, is taken as 37 miles an hour
inclusive of the short hourly halt.
The lower portion of the graph thus represents the
calculations for the march table clearly and concisely,
and their accuracy can be more readily checked in this
form than from the march table itself.
This particular case is, of course, a simple one, but
the value of the graph increases with the difficulty of
the problem.
10. The march from the Inn onwards is represented
in each case by lines at uniform infantry pace.
11. If the commander wishes to have a halt of an
hour during the march, reference to the graph and the
map shows that the COLLEGE at NEW EGHAM and
VIRGINIA WATER will be reached at a suitable hour
by the infantry and mounted troops respectively. The
commander decides to close up the infantry into the
college grounds and thus enable the remainder of the
column to halt on the roadside opposite the lake and
stream.
The figure shows the head of the infantry brigade
arriving at the COLLEGE at 1210 hours, the tail closes
up and the brigade thus becomes a point. The head
