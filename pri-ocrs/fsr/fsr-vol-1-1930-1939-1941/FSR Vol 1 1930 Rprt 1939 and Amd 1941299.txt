CHAPTER XVIII
OFFICE WORK IN THE FIELD
168. General principles
1. Office work in the field will be so organized that
outgoing correspondence is reduced to the minimum and
incoming correspondence dealt with rapidly.
The number of summaries, pamphlets, memoranda,
&c., issued must be limited to what addressees really
want to know and have time to read. In this con-
nection the free use of maps, diagrams, graphs, and
tabulated forms of various natures will often save time.
2. The efficiency with which commanders and their
staffs can carry out their duties will depend largely
upon an intimate personal knowledge of local conditions
and upon the existence of mutual understanding and
sympathy between themselves and the troops. These
demand frequent visits of both commanders and staffs
to subordinate commanders and the troops. While,
however, tours of inspection and personal inquiry into
local conditions are valuable there will always be some
office duty which must neither be avoided nor delayed
if the work of commanders and staff is to be effective.
The better an office is organized the less time need
be spent in it. Every commander must personally dis-
courage the calling for unnecessary returns, reports, &c.
3. The general system of office routine will be identica
throughout the force.
