Chap. III, Sec. 13.]

iii. The exercise of foresight to ensure the timely
anticipation of difficulties likely to be ex-
perienced, or of material likely to be required
by fighting troops and services in the execution
of orders.
iv. The arrangement of all matters with a view to
removing anticipated difficulties and facili-
tating the prosecution of the commander's
plan of operations.
3. While there is but one staff, having but one purpose,
it is necessary that the work of the staff should be
distributed in accordance with the nature of the duties
to be performed. The staff is therefore organized in .
four branches :
i. The General Staff branch.
ii. The Adjutant-General's branch.
iti. The Quarter-Master-General's branch.
iv. The branch of the
Master General of the
Ordnance.
4. The work of each of these branches of the staff is
dealt with more fully in Chapters IV to VII, but broadly
speaking their duties are as follows :-
i. The general staff branch deals with the employ-
ment of the fighting troops, and with all
matters connected with the actual execution
of military operations.
ii. The other three branches deal with the main-
tenance of troops in the theatre of war, in-
cluding the supply to the combatant troops
of everything that is required to enable them
to carry out their task.
