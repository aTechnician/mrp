137. Salvage organization
1. Salvage will in the first instance be collected by
the troops into unit dumps and will normally be evacu-
ated thence by returning second line transport to divi-
sional dumps, and from divisional to corps dumps by
third line transport.
When either second or third line
transport returning from its forward supply duties can-
not undertake this duty, formation and area commanders
will make such other arrangements for the transport of
salvage to corps dumps as may be possible. In the
event of no road transport being available salvaged
material will remain in divisional or unit dumps awaiting
special salvage operations. Such conditions, however,
should be rare, and obtain only during actual battle.
The location of unit, divisional, and corps dumps will
be decided and published in orders or administrative
instructions by unit and formation commanders.
