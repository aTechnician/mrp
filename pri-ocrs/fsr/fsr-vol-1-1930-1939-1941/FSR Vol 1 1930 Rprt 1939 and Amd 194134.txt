militia (including the supplementary reserve). A
partial mobilization would involve only the mobiliza-
tion of such units and the calling up of such reservists
and militia (including supplementary reservists) as
may be required for the force to be mobilized.
2. Unless otherwise ordered war establishments
will be brought into force on the first day of mobilization.
3. On leaving its place of mobilization a unit will,
unless otherwise ordered, come under the orders of the
commander of the formation to which it is allotted.
4. The detailed procedure to be adopted on mobiliza-
tion is given in Regulations for Mobilization.
The
prescribed military authorities are responsible that
preparations are made in peace, in accordance with
these regulations, for either general or partial mobiliza-
tion as may be ordered.
5. Before its mobilization the Territorial Army is
first " embodied," which is equivalent to being brought
on to the peace footing of the Regular Army. Units are
then concentrated. The subsequent steps for complete
or partial mobilization of the Territorial Army are
similar to those taken for the mobilization of the Regular
Army â€¢
