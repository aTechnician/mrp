ground.
2. In brigade and larger encampments one main
centre and one main cross street will run the entire
length and depth of the camp.
3. Units should not be cramped for space, but on the

not be increased unduly, as a straggling camp entails
extra fatigue duties and delay in circulating orders.
4. The usual interval between units is 10 yards.
Between squadrons of the same regiment and between
the component parts of an artillery brigade the interval
may be reduced to one yard, and between the companies
of a battalion to three yards.
5. A trench should be dug immediately under the
curtain of a tent and the excavated earth banked on the
outer edge of the trench. The curtain should then be
pegged to the inner slope of the trench, the canvas thus
draining into it. Surface drains should be constructed
to prevent rain water lodging in the trenches.
6. Tent flies will be looped up the first thing every

standing camp tents will be struck periodically, and the
