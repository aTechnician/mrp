11. In allotting billets regard will be had to the
interests of the inhabitants as well as to the comfort of
the men, any readjustment being made after the troops
have settled in.
Vacant accommodation in the area
will be reported to headquarters.
12. The following points will be observed in addition
to those given in Sec. 141, 12 :â€”
i. Headquarter offices will be selected with due
regard to signal communications and so that
they can be easily found. In areas occupied
successively by different formations, as a
principle, the
same buildings should be
occupied as headquarter offices.
ii. Mounted men must be near their horses, guns and
wagons; mechanical transport drivers near
their vehicles and staff officers near their
offices.
111. Both sides of a street will be allotted to the
same unit to prevent confusion in case of
alarm.
iv. Roads and communications must never be
blocked. Guns and vehicles will, if necessary,
be parked outside towns and villages, and
hidden from observation from the air. If
parked on the sides of roads, the first and last
guns or vehicles will be marked with a shaded
light during darkness.
148. General vules in billets
1. From the moment the advanced troops enter a
village or farm, precautions must be taken to prevent the
inhabitants from conveying information to the enemy.
