They allow of proper rest, and give shelter from the
weather, but usually cause dispersion of the troops.
This disadvantage may be partly overcome by resorting
to close billets, when as many men as possible sleep in
houses, the remainder bivouacking. Troops in billets
are concealed from observation from the air, while the
cellars of houses afford useful cover from bombardments
or from attacks by enemy air forces.
5. Bivouacs admit of concentration and readiness,
but are trying to the health of men and horses in cold
or wet weather, and should be resorted to only in cases
of tactical necessity.
6. Camps admit of concentration, and are healthy,
but can be used only in exceptional circumstances by
troops engaged in field operations. Tents quickly
become unserviceable and their carriage requires a con-
siderable amount of transport. For standing camps huts
are healthier and more comfortable than tents. In hot
climates huts or tents with thick or double roofs should
be used.
7. When attack from the air on any considerable
scale is possible, the conflicting tactical and administra-
tive interests must be carefully weighed in laying out
a camp or bivouac. Smooth administration calls for
concentration and a certain degree of symmetry. Cover
is necessary for health. On the other hand, protection
from air attack demands entrenchment, irregularity
of form in the lay-out, absence of conspicuous arrange-
ments for cover and some measure of dispersion. Camps
may sometimes be erected but not occupied, in order
to deceive hostile airmen.
