[Chap. XXI, Sec. 195.
5. To avoid delay in the transmission of acquit-
tance rolls from the base to the fixed centre paymaster,
separate acquittance rolls will be made out for men
belonging to different regiments or corps.
6. Particular care should be taken to see that the
total amount entered on the monthly account in respect
of pay to soldiers agrees with the total actually paid
on each acquittance roll. Entries on acquittance rolls
of sums which for any reason cannot be paid at the time
should invariably be struck out and the total amended ;
under no circumstances should an acquittance roll be
delayed with a view to completing all the payments
originally shown on it, if the payees are not readily avail-
able. In such cases a fresh roll should be prepared for
the absentees when they are actually paid.
7. If a soldier wishes to make a remittance of undrawn
pay, his O.C., after seeing that the amount is not in
excess of his credit as shown by his pay book, will
prepare A.F. O 1727A, enter the amount in the pay
book under cash payments as a remittance, and sign
the entry, at the same time endorsing A.F. O 1727A
with the words " Recorded in A.B. 64." He will then
forward A.F. O 1727A in duplicate to the paymaster i/c
clearing house at the base. No remittances will be
entered on acquittance rolls.
8. Any cash taken over by the medical authorities in
respect of an officer or soldier admitted to hospital will
be credited by the officer concerned in his next monthly
imprest account for necessary adjustment by the pay-
master i/c clearing house. In the case of an officer he
will, on discharge from hospital, make application to
