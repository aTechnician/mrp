of prisoners sent back must be employed to assist in this
work.
When the R.A.P. is moved forward field ambulance
bearers will collect and carry back to A.D.S. such
wounded as the regimental stretcher-bearers have been
unable to collect and bring in to R.A. Ps.
5. In principle the only treatment to be given in the
A.D.S. is the adjustment of dressings and the revival
of wounded by means of hot drinks and bodily warmth.
From A.D.S. the wounded are cleared as rapidly as
possible to M.D.S. by the road transport of field ambu-
lances. At M.D.S. any very urgent surgical operation
may be performed, dressings and splints, &c., adjusted,
and the necessary clerical work to obtain a record of
admissions is carried out.
Arms, equipment, and personal kit of sick and
wounded will be taken to the field ambulance with
them. Ammunition will invariably be taken from
wounded men before they are sent to the rear. Arms
and equipment will be sent to M.D.S. and there col-
lected and disposed of under divisional or corps arrange-
ments.
6. From M.D.S. wounded are evacuated to C.C.S.
by the motor ambulance convoys working under the
orders of the D.D.M.S. at corps headquarters. In
certain contingencies motor ambulance convoys may
be utilized as far forward as the A.D.S.
7. Walking wounded are cleared from the W.W.C.Ps.
to M.D.S. in a similar manner to those from A.D.S.,
except that when road transport cannot be made avail-
able the O.C. field ambulance concerned will arrange
