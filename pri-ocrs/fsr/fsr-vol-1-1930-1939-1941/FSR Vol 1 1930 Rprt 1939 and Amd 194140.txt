4. The C.-in-C., through his staff, keeps the Army
Council fully informed of his requirements, of the
relative urgency of his various demands and of the
points to which delivery should be made. In meeting
these demands the Army Council ensures, as far as
possible, that deliveries are made in the order and to
the points notified by the C.-in-C.
10. Administration in a theatre of operations
1. The C.-in-C. controls the administration of the
forces in the field through his staff and through the heads
of services at G.H.Q. (see 55, 3), delegating to sub-
ordinate commanders such powers of local administra-
tion as may be desirable.
2. It is the duty of all authorities throughout the
theatre of operations to assist by all means in their power
those concerned with the direction of both general and
local administrative arrangements.
3. Except in urgent and unforeseen circumstances
no subordinate commander will interpose his authority
in matters of general administration. Should it be
necessary to do so the action taken must be reported
at once to G.H.Q.
4. If for any reason direct control of general adminis-
trative arrangements in a particular locality is incon-
venient, a temporary echelon of G.H.Q. under a senior
staff officer may be detached to exercise the necessary
control. All orders and instructions issued under the
authority of the senior staff officer of such an echelon will
be considered as emanating from G.H.Q. (see Sec. 7, 3).
