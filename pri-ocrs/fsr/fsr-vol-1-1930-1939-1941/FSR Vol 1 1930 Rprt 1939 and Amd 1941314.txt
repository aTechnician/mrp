iv. Purchase by contract.

vi. Forced cultivation.
4. Subject to specific orders from superior authority,
the officer responsible for the local administration of an
area is the competent authority for putting into force
all measures for the utilization of the local resources
of the country, with the exception that money contribu-
tions may be collected only on the personal authority
of the C.-in-C., or of the commander of an army, or of
an independent force or area, on the specific delegation of
such authority by the C.-in-C.
5. In the utilization of local resources direct contact
between troops and inhabitants will be avoided as far as
possible. In principle the necessary measures will be
effected through the local civil authorities (mayor,
headman, or other official, or in their absence the prin-
cipal inhabitant) by a representative of the staff or of
the service concerned according to circumstances.
6. Except by written order from G.H.Q., officers
are forbidden to make promises, on behalf of the govern-
ment or of the army, to any person as to compensation
for property lost or destroyed in consequence of military
operations, or to induce any person to believe that such
compensation will be paid.
7. The army forms and books referred to in these
instructions will be printed in the language of the
country in which operations are to take place and will be
issued by the Paymaster-in-Chief, central payment
office for requisitions (see Sec. 177, 2, and Sec. 178) as
soon as possible after the outbreak of hostilities.
