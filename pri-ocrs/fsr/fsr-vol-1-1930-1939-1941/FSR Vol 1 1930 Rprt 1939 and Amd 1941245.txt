130. Veterinary evacuating stations
1. Veterinary evacuating stations are allotted to
armies usually in the proportion of one for each corps
in the army.
2. Their function is to relieve mobile veterinary
sections and corps and army troops units of sick and in-
effective animals, and to arrange for their evacuation to
veterinary hospitals in L. of C. areas. Pending evacua-
tion veterinary evacuating stations will arrange for the
care and treatment of such animals.
3. Their location will be decided in accordance with
the following principles :-
i. They should be sufficiently far forward, if
circumstances will allow, to ensure close touch
being maintained with units clearing to them.
ii. They should be in close proximity to a veterinary
evacuation railhead:
131. Veterinary evacuation railhead and railway
transport

selected with a view to its suitability for handling
animals, and may, according to circumstances, be
separate or one utilized for other purposes.
2. The rail transport provided for veterinary cases
will be arranged as required either in composite or
special trains, &c., by the local representatives of the
veterinary and transportation services.
