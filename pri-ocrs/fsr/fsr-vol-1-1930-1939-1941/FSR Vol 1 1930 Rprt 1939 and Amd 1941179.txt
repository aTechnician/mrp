[Chap. XIII, Sec. 86.
units will be dealt with where practicable by the army
organization.
5. Invaliding of air force personnel is carried out by
medical boards at the base hospitals in which they are
patients. In the case of flying personnel, when their
fitness for flying is in question, air force medical boards
are convened.
6. Commanders of air force units are responsible to
the commander of the army formation to which they are
attached for the observance of orders regarding sanitation.
7. Orders regarding burial places are issued to the
air force by the A.G.'s branch of the staff of the army.
8. Air force personnel are subject to air force and not
to military law, except when orders have been made
either under Section 179A or Section 184A of the Army
Act and Air Force Act,
in which case such personnel
may become subject to military law. Whether they
are so subject or not, however, in order to avoid con-
fusion, all orders and instructions of a disciplinary
nature issued by an army in the field must be equally
observed by air force units attached to that army.
With this object the staff of the air officer commanding
in the field must keep in close touch with the A.G.'s
branch of the staff at G.H.Q., so as to ensure that all
military orders of a disciplinary nature are repeated in
air force orders.
Similarly, personnel of the military forces are subject
to military and not to air force law, except when orders
have been made under the above quoted sections of the
Acts, in which case such personnel may become subject
â€¢to air force law.
