CHAPTER XIII
ORGANIZATION, DISTRIBUTION
AND COMMAND OF THE AIR
FORCE CONTINGENT WITH A
FIELD ARMY
83. Geneval remarks
GENERAL. Where this manual differs from
" The Employment of Air Forces with the Army in
the Field," the instructions contained in the latter
will be followed.
An air force contingent will always be allotted to an
army in the field; its strength and composition will
depend upon the general air situation, the type of
operation and the air equipment of the enemy, but it
will normally include fighter, bomber, and army co-
operation squadrons and kite balloons. This contingent
will be under the command of the military commander-
in-chief.
84. Functions of air force commanders with a field army
and their relations with the general staff
1. The air officer commanding the air force contingent
in the field is appointed to the headquarters of the C.-in-
C. (see Sec. 36, 5). He will act as adviser to the C.-in-C.
