serve a group of corps collecting posts. Rail, or inland
water transport utilized on the forward journey for
reinforcements, may be used for the evacuation of
prisoners to the L. of C. on the return journey, and in
these circumstances stations normally selected as rail-
heads for reinforcements (see Sec. 90, 4) will serve for the
evacuation of prisoners of war.
The disposal of prisoners of war arriving in depots
on the L. of C. will depend on the general policy laid
