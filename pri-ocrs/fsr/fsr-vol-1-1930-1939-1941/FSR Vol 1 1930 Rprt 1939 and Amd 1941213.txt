small forces. In all cases, whenever practicable,
requisitioning officers will be sent on with the advanced
troops to investigate the resources of the country and to
arrange for the collection at suitable points of any
available supplies.
3. In addition to the depots, parks and dumps,
established for the supplies service, in common with
those for material supplied by other services, it is
necessary to establish at various points throughout the
theatre of operations supply organizations for the
purpose of issuing rations in detail to small parties, or
detachments, both in formation and L. of C. areas.
Such organizations are termed " Detail issue depots."
The necessity for establishing detail issue depots and their
location will be decided by commanders of areas con-
cerned, on the advice of representatives of the D.S.T.
4. Every unit carries with it when moving :-
i. The unconsumed portion of the current day's
ration, forage and petrol, partly in vehicle
or on man and horse, and partly in first line
transport.
ii. An iron ration.
The iron ration is issued to every officer and man of a
field unit, and is to be carried on his person except in
the cavalry, in which arm the iron ration is carried in
first line transport. An iron ration will only be con-
sumed when no other rations of any kind are procurable,
and then only by order of an officer, who will be held
responsible that such action was necessary.
Iron rations will be inspected periodically, under
arrangements made by unit commanders, to see that
they are intact and fit for consumption.
