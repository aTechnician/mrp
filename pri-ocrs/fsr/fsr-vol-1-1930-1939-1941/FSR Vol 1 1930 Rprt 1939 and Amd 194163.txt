[Chap. IV, Sec. 19.
The operations section is responsible for issuing
the necessary instructions to the senior signal officer,
the latter being then responsible that intercommunica-
tion is arranged in accordance with requirements and
for informing the other branches of the arrangements
made.
2. To enable the operations section to carry out
these responsibilities, the fullest information possible
should be available, both in regard to our own forces
and, also, concerning the enemy's forces and the ground
in his occupation.
Generally speaking, the collection and distribution
of information regarding our own forces is the duty of
the operations section, that concerned with the enemy's
forces and the ground in his occupation being the
special task of the intelligence section (Sec. 20).
3. Information about our own forces comprises
everything which a commander may require to know
to enable him to decide what is possible for his own
troops to undertake. Concise statements may thus be
needed, which the operations section must be prepared
to produce, on such matters as the position, strength,
and movements of the units of the formation and of
neighbouting troops; the quantities of ammunition,
supplies, &c., readily available; the possibilities of
replenishment of men, animals and material; the
casualties suffered; the amount of fighting energy
estimated to be available having regard to fatigue and
hardship undergone.
Information on all these matters is compiled partly
by arranging for the necessary reports, partly by inquiry
from the other branches, and partly by frequent visits
