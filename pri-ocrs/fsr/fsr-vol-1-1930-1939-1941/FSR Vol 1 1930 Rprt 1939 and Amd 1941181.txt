[Chap. XIII, Sec. 87.
Categories (i) and ii) are held at army base depots,
and category (iii) at the aircraft depot, but all three are
despatched to railheads by army services. Air force
personnel will be attached to the army base ammuni-
tion depot to superintend category (i), but inspection
in the field of these stores will be carried out by
R.A.O.C.
To safeguard the aviation petrol in category (ii) from
contamination by petrol of other grades, some air force
personnel will normally be attached to the petrol
sub-section of the base supply depot and also to the
advanced supply depot, if one is formed.
4. The air force will be responsible for the transport of
supplies, ammunition and stores from railhead to air
force units, provided that the latter are within a distance
not exceeding that which can, having regard to the con-
ditions, be covered by one echelon of army transport, i.e.
25 to 40 miles according to circumstances. Should this
distance be exceeded, the army will be responsible for
the delivery of supplies, ammunition and stores to air
force authorities at refilling points within reach of the
transport of the air force units concerned.
5. An air force contingent will normally take the field
with a 72-day supply of general ordnance stores, equip-
ment, clothing and necessaries which are common to the
air force and the army. The further requirements to
maintain the air force in these stores will be demanded
by the air force overseas on the Air Ministry, who in turn
will demand supplies from the War Office for despatch
direct to aircraft depots overseas, whence issue in detail
to air force units will be made under air force arrange-
ments.
