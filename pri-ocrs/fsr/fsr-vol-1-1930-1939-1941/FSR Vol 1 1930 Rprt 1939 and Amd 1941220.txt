EVACUATION OF PERSONNEL
111. Evacuation of the dead, sick and wounded
1. The work of clearing the field of battle of dead and
wounded is primarily the duty of the troops. It is the
duty of the staff to include all necessary orders on this
matter in operation orders, or in administrative instruc-
tions. These orders, or instructions, will be drawn up
by the A.G.'s branch and will include arrangements
for :â€”
i. Collecting, searching, identifying and burying
the dead.
ii. Searching for and collecting the wounded.
2. The collection and burial of our own and the
enemy's dead will be carried out by burial parties
commanded by officers specially detailed in orders
issued by commanders of formations. So far as possible
burials of our own dead should be carried out by the
deceased soldiers' own units.
3. No bodies should on any account be buried
until they have been searched and, if possible,
identified, but it is the duty of the A.G.'s branch
to ensure the speedy burial of our own dead as well
as those of the enemy.
4. Instructions for the co-ordination of the work of
the troops in connection with the burial of the dead
and that of the graves service are given in Sec. 67.
5. The evacuation of the sick and wounded will be
carried out by the' medical service, and is dealt with in
the following sections.
