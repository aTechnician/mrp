in base depots to subordinate formations, after

47. Signals
1. The distribution of signal duties in the theatre of
operations is made on the following principles :
i. A signal unit is allocated to G.H.Q., to each
formation, and to the headquarters L. of C.
area.
ii. From these units a signal section is allocated
to the headquarters of every brigade and
to the headquarters of certain units requiring
special internal communication.
These units are shown in war establishments, and
their distribution in the theatre of war is made
automatically in accordance with the location of forma-
tions and units they serve. No signal unit, however,
exists solely for the formation or unit for which it is
allotted, and at times it may be necessary for the whole
or part of a signal unit to be withdrawn for employment
elsewhere.
