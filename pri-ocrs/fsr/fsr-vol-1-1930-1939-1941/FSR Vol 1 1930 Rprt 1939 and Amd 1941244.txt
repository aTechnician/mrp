2. It is the duty of commanding officers of units
having animals on establishment to ensure that the
advice of the veterinary service is obtained, and that it is
applied to the fullest practicable extent, in such matters
as horsemastership, suitability of quartering or cover
which it may be possible to provide under prevailing
conditions in the field, or the detection and isolation
of all suspected cases of contagious or infectious disease.
3. Serjeants, R.A.V.C., are attached to certain units as
laid down in war establishments. These N.C.Os. are
trained to render first aid in case of emergency, and under
the orders of a veterinary officer will supervise the care
of any sick animals treated regimentally or awaiting
evacuation. In units where there are no serjeants,
R.A.V.C., attached, the services of a suitable farrier
should be made available to assist the veterinary officer
under the orders of the officer commanding.
129. Mobile veterinary sections
1. A mobile veterinary section will form part of each
division. In the case of a cavalry division one mobile
veterinary section for each brigade will be included in
the division.
2. The function of a mobile veterinary section is to
relieve units of sick and ineffective animals and to
arrange for their treatment until evacuated.
3. When troops are stationary a mobile veterinary
section may retain a limited number of cases for treat-
ment, but it must be prepared to clear rapidly and move
at short notice.
