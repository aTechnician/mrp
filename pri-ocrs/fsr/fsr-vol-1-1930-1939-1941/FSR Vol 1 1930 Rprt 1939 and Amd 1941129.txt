replacement of assemblies by others sent up
from the rear, but will not normally include
the replacement of components of assemblies
for which skilled fitting is necessary.
ii. An organization to effect replacements and rapid
repairs beyond the capacity of the unit
organization is provided by the services within
easy reach behind units, in order that units
may not be deprived of the use of important
items of war equipment for longer than
necessary. Repairs which can be carried out
by these organizations are termed "SECOND
LINE REPAIRS.
iii. In the case of both (i) and (ii), above, the repairs
which can be effected are limited by the
necessity of keeping the repair organizations
sufficiently mobile to be able to move with the
units or formations of which they form part.
Equipment so disabled as to be incapable of
being rendered serviceable by a second line
repair organization will be exchanged by
arrangements made by the head of a service
or his local representative and returned to the
L. of C. for repair (Sec. 97). Repairs of
this nature are named " L. oF C. REPAIRS."
2. First line repair equipment is limited to such non-
power driven tools and spare parts as can be carried in
first line transport repair vehicles, and the artificers
on the war establishments are limited to the essential
trades necessary to effect replacements according to the
nature of the unit.
