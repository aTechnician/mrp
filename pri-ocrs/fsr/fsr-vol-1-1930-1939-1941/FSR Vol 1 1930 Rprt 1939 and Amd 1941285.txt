CHAPTER XVII
AMMUNITION SUPPLY
160. General principles
1. The fundamental principle of ammunition supply
is that ammunition must be passed systematically and
automatically from rear to front to replace that ex-
pended in battle.
Troops in action should never have to turn their backs
on the enemy to fetch further supplies.
2. A commander's power of man≈ìuvre is largely
dependent on ability to keep his troops supplied with
ammunition. Careful arrangements for ammunition
supply must therefore form part of every plan of opera-
tions, and early reconnaissance of the lines of ammunition
supply and of ammunition refilling points is necessary.
3. Sites for refilling points for all natures of ammuni-
tion and explosives are selected by the headquarters of
the formation concerned.
4. For purposes of economy, particularly in deliberate
operations, commanders may pool transport for general
purposes.
In mobile operations, however, no lorries or other
vehicles provided for the transport of ammunition
should be diverted from their legitimate functions,
except in very exceptional circumstances.
