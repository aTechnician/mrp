from whom the articles or services are requisitioned
and the signature of the requisitioning officer. The rank,
unit, or force of the requisitioning officer will in no
circumstances be shown on the original requisition
receipt note, but will be inserted by him on the duplicate
and triplicate notes in the space provided at the top of
the form and after his signature.
The articles requisitioned must be fully described,
so as to give all information necessary for the guidance
of the officer who will settle the claim. The weight
of the goods taken must in all cases be estimated and
inserted on the note: it is not sufficient merely to state
the number of bags or cases.
8. No money value is to be quoted on the original
requisition receipt note.
9. The original note only will be given to the local
civil authority or owner in the very exceptional circum-
stances when requisitioning has to be carried out direct.
The duplicate note will be sent to the central pay-
ment office for requisitions for payment of requisitioning
services by the representative of the service concerned,
or, if no representative is attached to the force, by the
commander.
The triplicate note will be sent, as soon as possible,
by the representative of the service concerned to his.
directorate.
The amount to be paid will be assessed in the direc-
torate concerned and stated on the triplicate note, which
will be passed to the central payment office for requisi-
tions with a covering schedule duly signed and certified
by a responsible officer.
