[Chap. XV, Sec. 137.
2. Sorting will normally take place at corps dumps,
but if expert personnel can be made available, as
opportunity offers, to carry out sorting at divisional
dumps this should be done.
3. The local representatives of services may take into
their charge and evacuate from dumps, after sorting,
any material for the provision of which their service is
responsible, disposing of it as may be required by the
working of their service. The more salvage that can
be taken over by services and re-issued or otherwise
disposed of locally in forward areas the greater will be
the saving in transport and labour, since not only is the
transport of salvage to the L. of C. avoided but also the
salvage thus taken into use obviates the transport of
similar material in the course of forward supply.
Salvage not taken over by services in forward areas
will normally be evacuated to the salvage depot on the
L. of C., whence it will be distributed to the base depots
of services concerned, or otherwise disposed of.
4. The process of sorting and evacuating routine
salvage (Sec. 138, 2), and the work of special salvage
(Sec. 138, 4), requires a central control as well as a
local control in the area of salvage operations. A
" Salvage control" will be formed if and when the
need arises (see para. 8, below), consisting of a central
office at G.H.Q. under the Controller of Salvage, a
representative salvage control office with each army
headquarters under a deputy-controller, a salvage
company for each corps in the field, and a salvage depot
on the L. of C.
When formed the salvage companies will consist of a
