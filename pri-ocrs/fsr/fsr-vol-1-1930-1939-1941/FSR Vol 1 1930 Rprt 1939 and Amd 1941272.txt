and horses the billet is to hold, and the name (or if
secrecy is essential the code-name) of the unit to which
it is allotted. The marks must be removed before
marching off.
9. In the meantime the officer of the party will select
and mark the position of the regimental headquarters,
guard room, medical aid post, gun and transport parks,
&c. He will also ascertain the best route for communi-
cating with brigade headquarters and headquarters of
neighbouring units, and the best roads into and out of
the billeting area. He will select suitable assembly posts
which will, if possible, be screened from observation
from the air. This completed he will, if time permits,
prepare a rough sketch for the commander of his unit
showing the allotment of billets and giving details
regarding roads and communications. On reassembling
his men he will notify them of the positions of head-
quarters, &c., and will despatch guides to meet the
units well clear of the billeting area and lead them to
their billets.
If the troops arrive before the marking of billets is
completed, they should be halted outside the area in
such a way that they will not block the road, and if
possible so that they are screened from air observation.
10. When time is not available for the above pro-
cedure the local authority, to whom the billeting demand
is presented, will co-operate in the allocation of billets
and will arrange for the billeting parties to be guided
to their allotted area. He will, at the same time, take
steps to notify the inhabitants that troops will be billeted
on them, and will promulgate any military orders to be
observed.
