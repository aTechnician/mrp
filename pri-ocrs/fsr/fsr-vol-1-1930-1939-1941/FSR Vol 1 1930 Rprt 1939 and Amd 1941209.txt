104. Utilization of transport for general purposes
1. When second and third line transport and first
line transport for which the D.S.T. is responsible is
used for general transport purposes, it is the responsi-
bility of the formation commander who issues the
orders for the transport to be so used to ensure that
there are adequate means to carry on the normal duty of
the transport in question' It may sometimes be found
that other means of transport, such as light railways,
can be. made available to replace temporarily either
third or second line transport. When such conditions
are likely to be prolonged it may even be possible
to install and operate light railway and tramway
systems almost to the front line, thus replacing the three
links in the chain of forward supply to the troops. When
conditions permit, the adoption of a forward supply
system of this nature will set free a large quantity of
transport, both mechanical and horse, which can be
utilized in part for general purposes and in part be
thoroughly overhauled, reconditioned and rested.
2. The factor which determines the distance over
which mechanical transport vehicles can be efficiently
operated is the necessity for allowing the operating per-
sonnel adequate time for :â€”
i. " Care and maintenance" of vehicles on com-
pletion of the day's run.
ii. Rest.
