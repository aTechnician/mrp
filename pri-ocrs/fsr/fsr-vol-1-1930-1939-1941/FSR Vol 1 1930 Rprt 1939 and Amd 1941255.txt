[Chap. XV, Secs. 139 and 140.
Material, after classification for the purposes of evacua-
tion, will be further sorted according to the service
concerned, and will be dealt with by the salvage organiza-
tion detailed below in consultation with the heads of
services or their representatives.
Material not to be evacuated by the salvage organiza-
tion (see Sec. 137), will be disposed of under the orders
of G.H.Q. If of any cash value such material may be
sold to local inhabitants, after breaking up or otherwise
rendering it useless for military purposes or for conveying
military information to the enemy; if valueless it will be
destroyed by burning, burial, or other convenient
method.
140. Salvage evacuation
1. Salvage
for evacuation will,
normally,
be
despatched to the salvage depot (see Sec. 137), but
serviceable items may be transported direct from salvage
dumps to area parks or dumps in charge of services as
required by the representatives of the services concerned.
Material thus taken on to the charge of services will be
incorporated by them into the organization of forward
supply as opportunity offers. The selection of such
material will rest solely with the services concerned.
Material left for evacuation to the salvage depot
will be disposed of according to its nature. The depot
will constitute a clearing house for all such material
and normally will deal with it by one or other of the
following methods :-
i. Transfer to the depots of services.
ii. Transfer to the ordnance service to be broken up
and reduced to scrap for use in factories, repair
shops, &c.. as raw material.
