175. Returns
1. The records of the individual, his pay, promotion
and pension depend on the various returns rendered by
units. Accuracy, therefore, in compiling them is essential.
The uses of all returns rendered to or by officer i/c
2nd echelon and the action taken by him on them are
described in Appendix III.
2. Each return rendered by a formation or unit in the
field will be numbered consecutively, dated, signed by
an officer, and inscribed legibly with the name of the
unit, and the formation (if any) of which the unit forms
part.
