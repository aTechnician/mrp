[Chap. XVI, Sec. 141-
x. Well-paved yards and large buildings with good
access to main roads will be reserved for
mechanical vehicles.
xi. Mobile workshops should, if possible, be located
in close proximity to a lateral road.
13. Divisions and smaller formations must make
suitable provision for corps and army units attached,
and for air force detachments.
14. When in proximity to the enemy, every unit
must be given an assembly post in the vicinity of its
quarters, at which it will assemble in case of attack
and from which its battle position can be quickly
reached. If units are scattered in billets it may be
advisable to have squadron, battery and company
assembly posts.
Routes from billets to assembly posts and from assem-
bly posts to battle positions must be reconnoitred.
Care must be taken that main communications will not
be blocked by troops proceeding to their assembly posts,
and that troops from different areas will not cross each
other in proceeding to ground which they may have to
defend in case of attack.
15. Special arrangements must be made for the pro-
tection of troops in quarters against observation and
bombardment by hostile air forces, and for defensive
measures against gas or bombardments by high velocity
guns in areas where such attack is possible.
Civilians are entitled to protection from these special
forms of attack, and arrangements must be made for such
protection to be given.
