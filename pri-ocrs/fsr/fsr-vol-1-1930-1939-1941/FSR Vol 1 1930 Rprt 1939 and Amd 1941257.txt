CHAPTER XVI
QUARTERS
141. General principles and rules
1. Quarters consist of billets, close billets, bivouacs
camps, trench shelters, and dug-outs.
2. Consideration must always be given to the possi-
bility of detection and attack from the air (including gas
attack) when selecting or siting any type of quarter.
3. In the presence of an enemy tactical considerations,
e.g., favourable ground for deployment in the event of
battle, concealment from ground and air observation,
facilities for cover from bombardment and economy in
outposts, are of primary importance. In these cir-
cumstances, the time required to get the troops under
arms and in position to meet the enemy determines the
type of quarters to be adopted. Thus it will often be
possible to billet the main body of an army, its covering
force being placed partly in close billets and partly
in bivouacs, trench shelters and dug-outs. When not
in proximity to the enemy, the health and comfort of
the troops is the first consideration, although protection
from attack from the air must usually be taken into
account.
4. Billets are the usual form of quarters in civilized
countries when not in close proximity to the enemy.
