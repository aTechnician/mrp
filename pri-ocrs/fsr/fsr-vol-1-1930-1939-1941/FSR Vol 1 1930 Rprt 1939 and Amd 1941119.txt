[Chap. X, Sec. 51.
ii. All ranks evacuated on medical grounds behind
regimental aid posts.
iii. Prisoners of war and men under unsuspended
sentence of detention or imprisonment.
iv. Unposted reinforcements in the theatre of war
belonging to the corps.
2. The "X" List records will be kept separately
at the D.A.G.'s office at the base in exactly the same
manner as the records of any other unit of a corps.
Taking, say, the Cheshire Regiment as an example,
the result will be that the corps in the held would
consist of :-
1st Bn. Cheshire Regiment ? Regular Army.
2nd
4/5
99
7th
"X" List â€ž
Territorial Army.
99
99
Regular and Terri-
torial Army to-
gether.
3. So soon as an officer or soldier in a theatre of war
is struck off the strength of a regimental establishment
under (i), (ii) or (iii) of para. 1, above, he will be posted
to the " X" List of his corps. On return to regimental
duty he will be struck off the " X" List at the base and
reposted to the unit he joins. In the same manner, a
nurse will be posted to and struck off the " X " list of her
service. All personnel posted to the " X" List will be
replaceable by reinforcements.
4. Personnel temporarily detached from their units,
and not actually posted or transferred to other units,
will not in any circumstances be posted to the "X"
List, neither will they be replaceable by reinforcements.
