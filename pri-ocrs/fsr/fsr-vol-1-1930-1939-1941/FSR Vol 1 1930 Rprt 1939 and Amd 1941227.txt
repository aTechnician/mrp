[Chap. XV, Sec. 117.
ii. As a reserve, under the D.G.M.S., for allotment
as required in emergency.
2. Ambulance car companies (R.A.S.C.) are normally
employed on the L. of C. for clearing ambulance trains
arriving from the front and distributing the sick and
wounded to the various hospitals, and for conveying
patients invalided from hospital to quayside for
embarkation.
3. In country where motor ambulance convoys cannot
be employed, the transport provided under arrange-
ments made by the Q.M.G.'s branch, will wherever
possible be specially fitted for the conveyance of sick
and wounded. In these circumstances the representa-
tive of the D.G.M.S. with the formation will arrange
for R.A.M.C. personnel to accompany the transport
columns for the care of the sick and wounded.
As a general guide to the amount of transport likely
to be required the following principles may be
assumed :â€”
i. The ambulance wagons and cars of field ambu-
lances, including cavalry field ambulances,
will not be detached to such a distance, or
in such circumstances, as will prevent them
rejoining their unit on the same day.
i1. During periods of movement or of halting,
without serious fighting or epidemic sickness,
a steady inflow to field ambulances of about
0-3 per cent. occurs daily.
iii. During a general engagement some formations
may lose as many as 25 per cent. of their total
strength killed and missing and 20 per cent.
wounded, admitted to field medical units.
