169. Offce organization
1. Location.-The location of a headquarters having
been fixed in accordance with the principles stated in
Sec. 17, the location of the various offices composing
it is a matter for the local administration of the head-
quarter unit. Subject to the principles which follow,
the allotment of accommodation will normally be
carried out by the camp commandant (see Sec. 42, 2)
or officer acting for him.
The principles to be followed in the allotment of
accommodation for offices are as follows :-
i. The offices allotted to the branches of the staff
will be as close to the commander's office and
to each other as conditions permit.
ii. The offices allotted to each branch of the staff
will be grouped together.
iti. The offices allotted to officers holding technical.
appointments (see Sec. 36) will be as close as
possible to those of the general staff.
iv. The signal office will be close to that of the
general staff.
v. The offices of the heads and representatives of
services should be situated so as to provide
easy means of access to the offices of the
branches of the staff responsible for controlling
their work. On the other hand, these offices
need not be in such close proximity to the
offices of the staff as those of officers holding
technical appointments or the signal office.
