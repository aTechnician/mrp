2. The head of the service will be the Deputy Chaplain-
General (D.C.G.) at G.H.Q. His representatives in sub-
ordinate formations are shown in war establishments.
3. The personnel of the service will be provided from
the Royal Army Chaplains Department. The distribu-
tion of chaplains will be effected, in the recognized
religious denominations, by the D.C.G. and his
representatives in formations in accordance with
requirements. In principle a pool of chaplains will be
attached to general, army, corps and divisional head-
quarters for the service of formation troops, and to each
cavalry and infantry brigade for duty as required with
regiments and battalions. The number of chaplains
attached to a formation headquarters will vary according
to the number of units allotted to the formation for the
time being (Sec. 3, 6).
4. Chaplains must work in close co-operation with the
medical and the graves services. The senior chaplains
of formations will be responsible for so placing the
chaplains at their disposal, that adequate provision is
made for ministering to the wounded and dying, and for
burials. A sufficient number of chaplains should
always be in attendance on troops in action. The
regimental aid post is usually the best centre from which
such chaplains can operate.
67. Graves service
1. The graves service will be responsible for arranging
for the provision of suitable cemeteries, for ensuring the
preservation of the records of all burials, and for pro-
viding means of identification of graves. Full particu-
lars of the records will be transmitted to the War Office.
