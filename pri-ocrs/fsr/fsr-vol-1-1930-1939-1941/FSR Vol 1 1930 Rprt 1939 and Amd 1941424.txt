to enforce requisitions.

local civil authority (or principal inhabitant) through
whom the articles or services are requisitioned, whether
such articles or services are taken for the use of the
troops, or for protection.
3. The notes must not be given to inhabitants, except
in the special circumstances when direct requisitioning
has to be resorted to.
