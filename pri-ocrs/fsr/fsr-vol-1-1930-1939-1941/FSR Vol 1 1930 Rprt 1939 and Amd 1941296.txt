166. Ammunition supply in deliberate operations
1. In order to meet any possible breakdown in the
railway system or other unforeseen emergency, army
and corps reserves of ammunition should be established
in suitable positions and in sufficient time, before
operations begin, or as soon as any pause occurs in
mobile warfare.
A natural tendency to dump an unnecessary quantity
of ammunition must always be guarded against. Am-
munition can seldom be dumped to meet every possible
contingency. The control of ammunition must remain
in the hands of the higher formations as long as possible.
2. The army, guided by instructions received from
G.H.Q., will lay down how much ammunition is to be
held in front of railhead, and its general distribution.
This ammunition will be generally divided between :-
i. Ammunition on charge of divisions and corps
medium artillery.
ii. Corps reserves.
iri. Army reserves.
Corps reserves are usually supplied by rail or by
maintenance companies or corps troops maintenance
companies drawing from railhead.
Army reserves are normally supplied direct by rail.
3. Army ammunition railheads, depots, or dumps
should be beyond the effective range of the enemy's
ordinary long range guns, and arrangements must be
made for protection againt attacks from the air.
Ammunition railheads must be selected for rear
zones. These should be constructed to admit of lorries
being loaded direct from the broad gauge line.
