[Chap. XIV, Sec. 91.
of units is the duty of the remount service, except in
so far as provision is made for the supply of animals to
units as part of complete turnouts issued from advanced
horse transport depots (Sec. 97). In the latter case
the animals are supplied by the remount service to the
transport service.
No privately-owned animal is permitted to embark
for a theatre of operations or to be taken on the strength
of a unit.
2. Remounts on arrival in a theatre of operations will
be taken direct to base remount depots where they will
be conditioned and trained. Each depot will not, as a
rule, have a holding capacity exceeding 2,250 animals
in any one locality. For this number three remount
squadrons will be required.
3. Animals to complete reserves held in depots are
obtained :—
i. From outside the theatre of operations, by
drafts.
ii. From local resources by purchase or requisition.
iii. By drafting animals recovered from sickness or
wounds from veterinary units.
4. Animals drafted to a theatre of operations from
• outside sources will, if possible, be received at a port
or ports distinct from those used for material. These
ports may, if necessary, be identical with those used for
the receipt of reinforcements of personnel. Where this
is not possible, separate sections of ports in common
use for all purposes will be set aside for the reception
of animals.
