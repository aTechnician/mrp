payment must be made for the goods except as laid down
in the instructions in Sec. 177, 2.
When payment is made on the spot no acknowledg-

requisitioning officer, but a receipt for the amount paid
will be obtained.
Payment, whether immediate or
deferred, will, as a rule, be made to the authority through
whose agency the goods or services are obtained, and not
to individual inhabitants.
3. When in exceptional circumstances requisitioning
has to be carried out direct, i.e., without the agency
of the civil authorities, it will not be necessary to present
a demand (A.F. F 780), but except when payment is
made on the spot a requisition receipt note (A.B. 361)
will be given to the owners for goods or services rendered.
4. Requisition receipt notes will in all cases be made
out in triplicate, but the original note only will be given
to the civil authority (or owner in the exceptional cir-

The duplicate note will be sent to the central payment
office for requisitions by the representative of the service
concerned, or, if no representative is attached to the
formation, by the commander.
The triplicate note will be sent as soon as possible,
through the representative of the service concerned,
to the directorate to whom he is responsible.
If on receipt of the note the director decides, in
exceptional circumstances, to settle the claim, a state-
ment to that effect will be made on the note and the note
sent to the central payment office for requisitions for
