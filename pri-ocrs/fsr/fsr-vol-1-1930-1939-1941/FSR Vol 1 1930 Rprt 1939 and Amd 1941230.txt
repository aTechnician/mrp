main line, and ambulance trains are loaded from trans-
port, whether road transport, light railway or trolley,
it is advisable to group such sidings at a station, not
in use for other purposes, which becomes the ambulance
railhead.
2. If road transport is used to load the trains,
ambulance railheads require the best possible road
approaches, and especial care will be taken to keep
these in as smooth a condition as possible in the interest
of the wounded. Good cover and protection, especially
from the enemy's action by air, is desirable. In addition,
since it is not always possible to be sure of the arrival
of ambulance trains in time to clear each convoy as it
comes from C.C.S., the provision is necessary of suitable
places at the railhead in which the wounded may await
entrainment.
120. Ambulance trains
1. The number of ambulance trains required in a
theatre of operations will depend on the scale of opera-
tions and the distance from the base ports at which
they are taking place. Normally trains on a scale
of one for each division in the field for small forces,
and two for every three divisions for large forces, will
suffice.
2. The movement of ambulance trains is carried out
under the arrangements made through the movement
control in accordance, so far as the exigencies of the
railway service will permit, with the requirements of the
medical service. The D.G.M.S. will make his arrange-
ments, if possible, so as to permit of ambulance trains
leaving ambulance railheads at fixed hours daily. A
