responsible for the technical and financial methods
employed in providing for the requirements of the forces.

appointments to fill vacancies in command or on the

commanders authority to make similar temporary
appointments to command or in minor staff appoint-

5. In the event of hostilities taking place in two or
more separate theatres of operations, His Majesty's
Government will decide whether the command of all
forces in the field shall be vested in one C.-in-C. or
whether it will be preferable to constitute two or more
separate commands and to appoint a C.-in-C. for each.
