starting point. Its position is represented on the
graph by the point P, i.e., where the horizontal line
representing 1 mile distance intersects the vertical line
representing 0020 hours.
Similarly after 1 hour the head of the column will be
represented by point 2, 3 miles from the starting point,

and after 2 hours by the point R, 6 miles from the
starting point.
The line OR therefore represents the progress of the
head of the column.
The tail of this column, which is one mile long, will
pass the starting point at O plus 20 minutes (0020 hours)
and at 0100 hours will be two miles from the starting
point, i.e., at point Y on the graph.
The line XYZ will represent its progress.
