cash payment in the pay book the calculated amount
of pay so forfeited, based on the gross daily rate.

visions of para. 13, above, the former book is found, Part

forthwith to the fixed centre paymaster. Under no
circumstances will it be taken into use again or further
issues made on it.
15. No pay will be issued in respect of the period
before the soldier reports the loss until his balance has
been ascertained from the fixed centre paymaster.

Office with A.F. B 2090A, will pass Part II of the book
to the paymaster i/c clearing house for transmission to
the paymaster compiling the man's accounts. Part I will

after conclusion of a term of active service, or on the
