94. The advanced base
1. If an advanced base is established (Sec. 88, 9)
the forward supply of material may be made to units
by one or other of the following methods according to
circumstances :â€”
i. All detail loading may be carried out in advanced
depots, pack trains being thus originated at
advanced base and not at the base.
ii. Pack trains may be sent direct from the base,
loaded in detail with all material of a non-

added from advanced depots to complete
pack trains to requirements.
iii. Pack trains loaded completely in detail at the
base may be sent to advanced base up to one
day in advance of requirements. Such trains
should be held at advanced base until the
correct hour for despatch on the shorter
journey to railheads.
iv. In conjunction with any one of the methods
above for loading in detail, material sent
by complete trainloads in
bulk may be
loaded wholly or partly at advanced base,
or wholly at the base, merely passing through
advanced base on its way to railheads.
2. The method chosen will depend on the purpose for
which an advanced base has been established. The

advanced base, the more important will be the scale
on which the advanced depots will be constituted.
