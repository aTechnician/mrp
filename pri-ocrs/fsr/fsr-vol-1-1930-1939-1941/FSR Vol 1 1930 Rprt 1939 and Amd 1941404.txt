[Appendix III.
(14) A.F. W 3314 (Report of burial).
Rendered by chaplains and other officers performing burials.
On receipt extracts are made and passed to the record section for
verification of regimental particulars, confirmation of death and
record on A.Fs. B 199A, D 420 and B 103. The O. i/c 2nd Ech. will
forward weekly to the War Office a consolidated burial return. (See
Sec. 67, 11.)
(15) A.F. B 2090A (Death report).
1. On the death of a soldier the O. i/c 2nd Ech. will render
A.F. B 2090A in triplicate as follows :—
One copy with the soldier's will (if any) attached to the
War Office or other military authorities concerned. In the
case where a deceased soldier, though serving under other
military authorities than the War Office, was paid from
Imperial funds, those military authorities will notify the War
Office of his death.
One copy with Part II of A.B. 64 (pay book) to the paymaster
at the base for transmission to the paymaster at home.
One copy with copy of will, if any, to be filed.
2. Any details that may be known regarding the soldier's place
of burial, i.e., map reference, &c., will be entered on the back of
the form.
(16) Presumption of death :—
1. A.F. B 2090B (Presumption of death on unofficial evidence).
A.F. B 2090g will be used in connection with the presumption of
death on the strength of an unofficial report. War Office will send
A.F. B 2090B in duplicate to O. i/c 2nd Ech., stating that it is
proposed to accept the report provided that the O. i/c 2nd Ech.
can furnish no evidence why this should not be done.
The O. i/c 2nd Ech. will communicate with the O.C. unit, who after
full enquiry, will report to the O. i/c 2nd Ech. either that evidence is
not sufficiently conclusive to presume death, or that no evidence is
forthcoming which would warrant death not being presumed.
The O. i/c 2nd Ech. then completes the A.F. B 2090B. If death
cannot be presumed, both the original and duplicate are returned to
the War Offce, who will bring up the case in such time as they may
deem it. If death is presumed A.F. B 2090B becomes the death
certificate for official purposes, one copy is sent to the War Office
and the duplicate to the regimental paymaster.
