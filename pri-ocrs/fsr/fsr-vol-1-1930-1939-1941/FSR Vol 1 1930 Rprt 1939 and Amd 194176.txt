25. The organization of the A.G.'s branch
1. The work of the A.G.'s branch falls broadly into
two categories :
i. Matters which affect the personnel of the forces in
the field collectively, such as organization
and medical services.
ii. Those which have a more intimate bearing on the
individual, such as discipline and the appli-
cation of international conventions.
2. Following this sub-division of duties the A.G.s
branch in formations is organized in two sections :â€”
i. The organization section.
ii. The personal services section.
The organization section deals with all matters
connected with the replacement of casualties, and
with the medical service. It is the section responsible
for the reporting of casualties, for graves registration
and disposal of the effects of the dead, for the executive
work in connection with modifications to existing
units, or the formation of new units. This section is
also responsible for the general supervision of pay
service.
The personal services section deals with matters of
discipline and of prisoners of war. It is also responsible
for questions of the spiritual welfare of the troops;
the scope of philanthropic institutions and the extent
to which their services will be utilized, and of the care
and comfort of official visitors to the theatre of operations.
The compilation, publication, and distribution of routine
orders is also the duty of the personal services section.
