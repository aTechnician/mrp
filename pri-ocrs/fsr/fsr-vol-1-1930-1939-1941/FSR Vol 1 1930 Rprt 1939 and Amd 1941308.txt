original. It is not used primarily for the purposes of
secrecy but of brevity.
A cipher message is one expressed in figures or letters
having a secret meeting.
2. The work of enciphering and deciphering is done by
cipher personnel under the direction of the General Staff.
3. It is forbidden to encode or encipher a portion of
the text of a message leaving the remainder in clear,
lest the portion in clear should provide a clue to that in
code or cipher and thus lead to the discovery of the code
or cipher in use.
Words such as " addsd," " rptd," and "ack" which
appear in the same position in the text of many messages
should, however, be sent in clear as their continual
translation into cipher would weaken its security.
Code names indicating the recipients to whom a message
is " addressed" or " repeated" should similarly not be
translated into cipher.
It is forbidden to refer in clear to a message in cipher
except to make replies of a routine character such as
"acknowledged,"
'approved," " agree," and "No."
Care must also be taken when it is necessary to refer to
a clear message in a cipher message that the wording of
the latter does not follow closely that of the former."
In order that the recipient of a message may know
that it has been transmitted in cipher, all copies of the
decipher will be stamped with the word " CIPHER" by
the cipher personnel.
4. Code and cipher books, which are issued on
mobilization to authorized persons, give the rules to
be observed in their use.
