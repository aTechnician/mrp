2. The following will ordinarily be paid out of
imprests :-
i. Cash issues to soldiers on acquittance rolls.
ii. All other services which cannot possibly be
effected by means of direct payments by a
cashier.
3. No officer can claim exemption from receiving an
imprest of public money for the purpose of making a
payment which cannot conveniently be made through
another channel.
4. Officers receiving imprests are held responsible
for all money so advanced to them, until it has been
satisfactorily accounted for.
5. Officers, not being regular imprest holders, who
require an imprest, will, if possible, obtain the prior
authority of their formation commander or head of the
service concerned, and forward it with the first requisi-
tion for cash to either the paymaster-in-chief or the
nearest field cashier. A brief statement should be
forwarded at the same time for the information of the
paymaster-in-chiet as to the purpose for which the
imprest is required and the probable frequency and
amounts of subsequent requisitions so far as can be
estimated.
6. If no prior authority is obtained an imprest may be
issued at the discretion of the paymaster-in-chief or
field cashier when it is certified that immediate issue is
essential on military grounds. An officer obtaining an
imprest on such a certificate will at once apply for cover-
ing authority and forward the authority when obtained
to the paymaster from whom the imprest was received.
