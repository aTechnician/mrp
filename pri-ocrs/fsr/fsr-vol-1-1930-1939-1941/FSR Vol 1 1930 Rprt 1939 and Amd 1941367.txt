[Appendix II.
(BLACKDOWN) 2 miles east of FRIMLEY, the field
brigade R.A. is at MARLBOROUGH LINES and the
field company R.E. at the Royal Military College,
SANDHURST. Each group has thus a separate route
to the Inn.
For the purposes of this illustration road spaces are
taken to be infantry brigade, 2 miles; field brigade
R.A., 1 mile; field company, R.E., $ mile; and field
ambulance, 1 mile.
The basis of the march is the timing of the head of the
infantry brigade at the Inn, and this has been ordered for
0900 hours.
8. A horizontal (distance) line should first be chosen
to represent the starting point and a point to represent
the head of the column should be marked on it at one of
the hours. This hour line becomes 0900 hours and the
hour scale can be completed accordingly. Having
fixed the head of the column on the starting line as
above, the timing of successive units should be marked
off along it. As the infantry brigade is 2 miles long,
it will take 40 minutes to pass the starting point, and
therefore, the timing of the head of the field brigade
R.A., which follows it, will be 0940 hours.
The field brigade R.A., at infantry pace, will take
20 minutes to pass, and the timing of its tail will be
1010 hours not 1000, owing to the short halt from 0950
hours to 1000 hours.
The timing of the head of the field
company R.E. will, therefore, be 1010 hours, and that
of the field ambulance 1020 hours.
9. The next process is to find the hour of start of
units from their quarters. The unit starting points
