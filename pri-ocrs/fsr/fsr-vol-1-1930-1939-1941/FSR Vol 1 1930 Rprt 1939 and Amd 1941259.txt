8. Trench shelters and dug-outs are used in deliberate
operations and their construction is described in the
• Manual of Field Works (All Arms). Prolonged occupa-

to discipline and morale.
9. If an engagement is anticipated the larger units
should be distributed in the order from front to rear in
which they will come into action, provided that, when
liable to attack, cavalry and other mounted troops are
placed in the least exposed positions. Artillery, tanks,
armoured cars and ancillary units should be covered by
the other arms.
10. Areas for accommodation will be delimited and
allotted to formations by the general staff branch. › The
allotment of accommodation within these limits wil
then be the duty of Q.M.G.'s branch.
11. Areas selected for the accommodation of troops
in rear of the zone of active operations must be so
arranged that, so far as tactical requirements allow, the
troops are provided with the maximum comfort possible.
Since these areas will probably be made use of by bodies
of troops in succession, either during a concentration or in
the course of a move by stages from one area to another,
or for periods of rest and training, they will usually be
divided into billeting sub-areas.
The accommodation
available in each sub-area will be definitely allotted to
a complete formation: special sub-areas will be allotted
to artillery and other units with horses, and special
buildings or localities will be reserved for headquarters.
This procedure simplifies billeting arrangements, since
each formation is detailed to an area commensurate with
