sections, the movement section and the maintenance
section. In the lower formations of corps and divisions
the work will not normally justify the separate organiza-
tion of these two sections. (See Sec. 13, 5.)
2. The responsibility of the Q.M.G.'s branch in
respect of movement may be a matter either of general
administration or of local administration. In regard
to movement of a general administrative nature it is
essential that while, as in all matters of general ad-
ministration, a central control by G.H.Q. is main-
tained, a local control must also be applicable throughout
the theatre of operations to ensure continuity of move-
ment. For this purpose the Q.M.G.'s branch at G.H.Q.
has, where necessary, its own local representatives to
whom is delegated by it control over movement.
3. In regard to movement of a local administrative
nature for which commanders of formations and of
areas or sub-areas on the L. of C. are responsible (see
Sec. 11, 3), the movement section makes the necessary
staff arrangements in accordance with the orders of the
commanders concerned.
4. The duties of the movement section are :â€”
i. To ensure that the best possible use is made of
the resources of the transport system in the
theatre of operations as a whole.
ii. To carry out local administrative movement to
the fullest possible extent strate inter-
ment.
iii. To deal with demands for conveyance, and
questions of priority in despatches.
