[Chap. XV, Sec. 116.
In these circumstances the two companies of one field
ambulance are sufficient to provide for the formation
of the advanced dressing stations and for the performance
of the bearer work of carrying wounded from R.A.Ps.
to A.D.S. The remaining field ambulances will be
retained in reserve.
3. Main dressing stations, situated further back, are
formed normally by the headquarters of a field ambu-
lance, the companies of which may be providing advanced
dressing stations.
It should usually be possible to
provide better protection and accommodation for main
dressing stations than for advanced dressing stations,
attort to the woundentiot, the MoS. will pes propor
tionate to the quality of protection and accommodation
afforded.
4. The sick and wounded are normally collected from
A.D.S. and conveyed to M.D.S. by the ambulance
transport of the field ambulance. During periods of
heavy fighting it may be necessary to supplement ambu-
lance transport by transport of any nature surplus to
requirements, which can be made available by com-
manders of formations in the manner suggested, in
Sec. 104.
5. The number of main dressing stations to be formed
will depend on such factors as the distribution of the
troops in action, the number of advanced dressing
stations opened, and the number and direction of avail-
able roads. It is important that the M.D.S. should
be sited on a good road, and if possible that cover for
all wounded passing through should be available.
