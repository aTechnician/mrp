[Chap. XXI, Sec. 199.
3. The financial adviser will exercise general control,
by means of a current audit, as far as may be practicable,
over all cash, store and supply accounts.
4. He will be consulted with regard to financial
relations with allied, dominion and colonial govern-
ments, and the necessary accounting arrangements for
services of an abnormal character (e.g., requisitioning,
hiring, billeting and adjustments with other govern-
ments in connection with services in the field). He will
be responsible for calling the attention of G.H.Q. to all
such matters with a view to publication of the necessary
G.R.Os.
5. All decisions of financial importance with which he
has not stated his concurrence will be communicated to
him for information without delay.
6. With reference to losses with which the C.-in-C.
of the forces in the field is empowered to deal (see Sec.
198), it will be laid down that where losses involved are
in excess of certain amounts (to be laid down in G.R.Os.),
the cases must be referred to the financial adviser for his
concurrence before the write-off is approved, and that
cases below the amounts fixed will be forwarded to him
for information.
7. Heads of services may, if they deem it desirable,
consult him before placing a contract. Copies of all
contracts and statements of local purchases beyond a
value to be laid down in G.R.Os. will be furnished to
him periodically.
8. He will communicate direct with the accounting
officer of the War Office, whose local representative he is.
