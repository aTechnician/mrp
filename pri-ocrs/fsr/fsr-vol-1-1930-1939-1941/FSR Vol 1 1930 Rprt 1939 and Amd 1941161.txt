Letters, not exceeding 4-oz. in weight, and postcards:
emanating from the troops, from foreign attach√©s, and
from civilians employed by or accompanying an army
in the field, if addressed to places in Great Britain
(including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands)
and Northern Ireland, will be carried free. Parcels
will be prepaid, and a fee will be charged for the regis-
tration of postal matter. All such matter, except
registered correspondence, will be carried at the sender's
risk.
7. Conveyance of mails will be arranged normally as
follows :-
i. Mail to or from units is conveyed between the
unit and the appropriate post office (estab-
lished as in the last sentence of para. 4, above)
by postal orderlies detailed by the unit.
Every postal orderly will be provided with
an authority, signed by the officer com-
manding his unit, to receive mails from the
postal service, and with a book (A.B. 426)
in which to enter the names of officers and men
for whom he receives registered correspondence.
The book will be signed by the addressee as a
receipt.
The safe custody of mails between unit and
post office is the responsibility of the unit. It
is important that the postal orderlies should be
carefully selected men of good character, and
that they should be changed as seldom as
possible.
