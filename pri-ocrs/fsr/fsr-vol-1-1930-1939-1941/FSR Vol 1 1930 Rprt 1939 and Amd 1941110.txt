2. Horse artillery works with the cavalry. One
brigade is normally allotted to each cavalry division.
3. Field and light artillery together form the artillery
of the division. The divisional artillery is a definite
organization consisting of three field brigades and one
light brigade.
The divisional artillery, together with any additional
artillery placed under the divisional commander, forms
the divisional artillery group.
Non-divisional field brigades, called army field
brigades, are also provided.
These form a reserve of
field artillery at the disposal of the C.-in-C., and are
placed under corps and divisional commanders as
required.
4. Medium, heavy and super-heavy artillery are
also non-divisional artillery at the disposal of the
C.-in-C. Medium and heavy artillery will normally
come under the command of corps; the command of
super-heavy artillery will only in special circumstances
be delegated by army to corps.
5. Anti-aircraft artillery is allotted to air defence
brigades. It is distributed according to the scheme of
air defence approved by the C.-in-C. for the theatre
of operations.
Anti-aircraft artillery batteries are
organized in brigades and may be retained as G.H.Q.
troops or allotted to subordinate formations.
6. Coast artillery is distributed according to the
requirements of coast defence; the majority will be fixed
but a proportion may be mobile. It will be organized
for tactical purposes into fire commands and for adminis-
trative purposes according to local conditions.
