[Chap. XIV, Sec. 107.
cannot therefore refill from third line until the following
morning.
7. Supplies drawn at railhead by third line transport
would normally be for consumption on the second day
after that on which they were drawn. These supplies
can therefore :â€”
i. Be taken at once to refilling point, and trans-
ferred to second line transport, or dumped
pending arrival of second line transport.
ii. Remain in the supply lorries of third line trans-
port (maintenance companies) overnight.
iii. Be temporarily dumped elsewhere according to
circumstances, for reloading in third line
transport and conveyance to refilling point.
The movement and transfer of supplies may, owing
to the enemy's air activity, be impracticable during
certain hours. In these circumstances the hours of
drawing from railhead and of transfer between lines of
transport may require modification and the method
of dealing with supplies must be adapted to meet
conditions.
8. After refilling, second line transport will proceed
direct to meeting points as soon as the latter have been
fixed by the brigade or other formation headquarters
concerned. When tactical conditions make the selec-
tion of meeting points impracticable until a late hour,
it will usually be desirable for second line transport to
be moved forward from " refilling point" to some
locality whence it can readily be despatched to " meeting
points." The responsibility for issuing the orders neces-
sary to effect such movement will rest with the O.C.
