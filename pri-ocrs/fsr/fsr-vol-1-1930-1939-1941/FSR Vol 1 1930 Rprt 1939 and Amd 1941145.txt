[Chap. XII, Sec. 67.
8. Single graves should not be more than 6 feet
6 inches long, 2 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. They should
not be more than 1 foot apart, and a path not exceeding
3 feet wide should be left between rows of graves.
9. The name of each cemetery should be marked on
a board at the entrance. Sites of cemeteries should
be :-
1. At least 100 yards from, and, if possible, on lower
ground than, the nearest building.
ii. Situated so as not to contaminate any water
supply.
iii. Easy of access.
10. If possible a separate cemetery, or plot in a
cemetery, will be used for the burial of the enemy's dead,
but in all cases such burials will be carried out, and
graves marked, in the same way as our own.
11. Every chaplain or other officer carrying out a
burial will prepare and forward to the officer i/c 2nd
echelon A.F. W 3314. This army form will also be
used in the case of the burial of enemy's dead but
should be clearly marked " Enemy's dead."
To ensure ready recognition, the locality of graves
will be given as definitely as possible, preferably by a
reference on a large scale map. The officer 1/c 2nd
echelon will render weekly to the War Office a consoli-
dated burial return embodying the information contained
in A.Fs. W 3314 received from chaplains or other
officers who have carried out burials. A separate
return will be rendered in the case of burial of the
enemy's dead.
