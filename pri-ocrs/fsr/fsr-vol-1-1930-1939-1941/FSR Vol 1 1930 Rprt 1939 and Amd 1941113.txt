[Chap. IX, Sec. 46.
FIELD ENGINEERING
10. In order that the services of the engineer units of
fighting formations may be utilized to the best advantage
it is necessary that the staff shouldâ€”
i. Co-ordinate and control the general scheme of
engineer work by subordinate formations,
especially in deliberate operations.
ii. Control the supply of engineer stores.
11. Co-ordination and control of engineer work
involve :-
i. In the advance
(a) Arrangements to bring forward, from parks
and depots, bridging equipment or special
bridging stores to the critical points at
the critical moment.
(b) Organization of any special arrangements
beyond those for which war establishments
and
equipment tables provide. Such
special arrangements may involve re-
distribution of engineer units or provision
of special plant, as, for example, would be
required in the event of a concentration of
troops in an area in which the supply of
water is likely to prove inadequate.
ii. In a retirement, special arrangements for the
organization of demolitions.
iii. In defence, especially in stabilized positions :
(a) The preparation of general schemes of en-
gineer work.
(b) The allocation to subordinate formations of
the work to be executed.
