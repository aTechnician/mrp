[Chap. XVII, Secs. 161 and 162.
These special requirements are then notified through the
proper channels to G.H.Q.
Should it be found in consultation between the
D.M.G.O. and the D.Q.M.G. that the ammunition
demanded by the various formations cannot be delivered
in the time required, reference will be made to the
C.G.S., who will decide the quantities to be sent for-
ward in accordance with the C.-in-C.'s plan.
5. In order to make provision G.H.Q. will require a
daily report from formations. These reports will
normally show the expenditure during the 24-hour
period covered by the report, and a forecast of antici-
pated abnormal expenditure. If any deficiencies in
echelons or dumps under formation control occur,
owing to enemy action or transport difficulties, these
deficiencies will be included in the report.
Abnormal conditions may be considered to exist when
stocks in rear of railhead are limited, when expenditure
in the forward areas is excessive, or when transport
facilities are a limiting factor in the chain of supply.
162. Distribution of ammunition veserves
1. The work of replenishing ammunition is divided
betweenâ€”
i. Units with divisions, cavalry divisions and corps
troops.
ii. Units working on the lines of communication,
which are responsible for the delivery of
ammunition at ammunition railheads.
2. The distribution of mobile ammunition reserves
for the fighting troops in the various ammunition
echelons in front of railhead is shown in Appendix V.
