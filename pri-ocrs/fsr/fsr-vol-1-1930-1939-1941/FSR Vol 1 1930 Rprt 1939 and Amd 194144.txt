tration, and for this purpose troops will be placed by
G.H.Q. at his disposal. These may be organized in
mobile columns, garrisons, and posts, according to cir-
cumstances. In addition, it will normally be necessary
to provide for defence against air attack and for police
duties.
Should a formation of the field army be detailed by
the C.-in-C. to operate within the L. of C. area the
respective responsibilities of the formation commander
and of the commander of the L. of C. area will be defined
by G.H.Q.
5. Subject to the approval of the C.-in-C. an area
will be divided by its commander into sub-divisions,
the number of which will depend upon the difficulties
of defence and administration peculiar to that area.
In the case of an area in occupation by an army, these
sub-divisions will normally correspond to the number
of corps in that army. The corps commander in turn
will sub-divide the corps area into divisional areas.
In each case of sub-division the area allotted to a
subordinate formation should be sufficient for the
local administration of that formation, but no more.
The residue of the area, not so allotted to a subordinate
formation, will remain for local administration directly
under the superior formation.
6. The sub-division of the L. of C. area will be
arranged similarly to that of an area occupied by an
army except that normally there will be no residue not
allotted. It will be divided into sub-areas, garrisons,
and posts, which should receive territorial designations.
To each a commander is appointed discharging within
