supplied, it is a matter of civility on the part of the
owner and must be received as a favour and not as a
right.
8. Staff officers must, immediately on arrival, com-
municate the position of their quarters to the head-
quarters of the area in which they are billeted.
149. Sanitation and conservancy in billets
1. The local authorities will usually be required to
take such sanitary measures as may be needed, but the
assistance of troops is generally required to construct
additional latrines, cookhouses, watering and washing
places.
2. Billeting parties must ascertain the source of the
local water supply, the measures which may be necessary
to guard it from pollution (Sec. 145, 3, ii), and the
conservancy system of the place. Notices will be posted
over houses where infection exists and over any other
houses in which it is not desirable to quarter men.
3. In billets, particularly in close billets, some over-
crowding is often unavoidable and special attention
must be paid to ventilation. Doors and windows will
be kept open whenever possible.
4. Billets must be left scrupulously clean. When the
situation admits, rear parties will be detailed to assist
the local authorities in this work after the departure of
the troops. If no town major has been appointed,
outgoing units will leave behind a representative to
hand over billets to the local authority or the incoming
units, who will sign a certificate that the billets as taken
over were clean and habitable.
