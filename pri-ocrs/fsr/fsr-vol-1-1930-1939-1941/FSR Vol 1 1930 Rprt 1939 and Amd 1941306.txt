checked before despatch, if possible, by an officer other
than the writer or originator of the instructions.
It will often be of advantage to issue several copies
of a letter to a subordinate commander, in order to save
re-typing in the subordinate office under conditions
possibly not so suitable for office work. This procedure
must, however, be followed with caution, as the practice
of sending on letters received from a superior com-
mander is often open to grave objection.
3. Filing.-Every office will arrange for the filing and
custody of its own correspondence. In the case of the
headquarters of divisions or of larger formations each
branch or section will normally retain and file its own
documents.
Documents retained in an office will be as few as
possible. With this object a review of correspondence
in files will be held every month at which papers, maps,
&c., will be sorted out into three categories :â€”
i. Those required for current use and local
reference.
ii. Those no longer required but likely to be of
historical value on questions likely to arise in
the future.
iii. Those not coming within category (i) or (ii).
Category (i) will be retained. Category (ii) will be
indexed and sent to officer i/c 2nd echelon for trans-
mission to the War Office. Category (iii) will be
destroyed. If there are any secret or confidential papers
in category (iii) they will be destroyed in the presence
of an officer.
