[Chap. XII, Sec. 71.
SERVICES CONTROLLED BY THE Q.M.G.'s BRANCH
71. Labour service
1. The duty of the labour service will be primarily to
provide unskilled labour for the forces in the field
throughout the theatre of operations so as to conserve
to the greatest possible extent the energy of the fighting
troops for their special duty of fighting and preparation
for battle, and of the services for their technical work of
maintenance.
2. The labour service would not normally be consti-
tuted as a service on mobilization. The work would be
done in the first instance by labour units controlled by
the Q.M.G.'s branch. These would be expanded into
a service if and when necessary.
When constituted as a service its head will be the
Director of Labour (D. Lab.) at G.H.Q. He will be
represented at army, corps, and L. of C. area head-
quarters.
The special duties of the director and his representa-
tives are :-
i. To determine labour requirements in consulta-
tion with the staff and heads of services or
their representatives.
ii. To allot labour units.
3. The personnel will be provided by the labour corps,
the officers and N.C.Os. of which will be found from
personnel of all arms either physically unfit to take their
place in combatant or service units, or specially qualified
as language or other experts.
