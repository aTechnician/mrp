CHAPTER XV
EVACUATION
110. General principles
1. In the interests of humanity it is important that
no man or animal unfit to withstand the stress of battle
should remain in the area of actual combat, or in its
close vicinity, a moment longer than necessary. In the
interests of economy it is equally important that no
material fit for the use of the fighting force, or which
can be used wholly or in part to reduce the demand for
new material, should be abandoned on ground vacated
by troops. In the interests of hygiene it is of paramount
importance that disposal be rapidly and effectively
made of the dead, both human and animal, and of
refuse of all descriptions.
2. An organization for the evacuation from the
battlefield as completely as possible of all that is no
longer required will be put into force at the outset of
a campaign. The furtherance of this object by troops,
staff, and services collectively and by each individual
to the best of his power is the duty of all.
3. In the following sections the organization for
evacuation and its working will be considered under
the several headings of personnel, animals and material.
