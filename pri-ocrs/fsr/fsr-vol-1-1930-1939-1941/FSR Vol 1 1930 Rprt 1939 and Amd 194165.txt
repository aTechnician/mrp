nearly automatic as possible.
3. The C.-in-C. has entire control of intelligence
within the theatre of operations.
The home authorities concerned will furnish the
C.-in-C. with all available information regarding
strength, composition, distribution and fighting qualities
of the enemy's forces, his intentions, so far as they can
be inferred, and all such other items as may be likely
to affect the conduct of the war.
In addition the home authorities will arrange for the
acquisition of information from sources outside the
theatre of operations on all matters which may affect
the operations, and measures will be concerted to ensure
the full and free interchange of information between
G.H.Q. and the home authorities.
4. While the responsibility for intelligence duties
in the field rests with the intelligence section of the
general staff, the varied nature of those duties requires
the assistance of a number of officers and other ranks
with special qualifications.
The C.-in-C. is authorized to attach to the general
staff, for duty in the intelligence section, such specially
trained personnel as may be required. All such
personnel will be incorporated in an Intelligence Corps,
under a commandant who will be responsible for its
administration. The Intelligence Corps will be con-
trolled and directed by the head of the intelligence
section at G.H.Q., who is responsible for its distribution
throughout the forces in the field in such a way as to
secure the best results.
