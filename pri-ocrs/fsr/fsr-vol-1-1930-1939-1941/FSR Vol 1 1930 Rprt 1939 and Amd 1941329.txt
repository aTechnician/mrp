[Chap. XX, Sec. 183.
accompanying or employed by the forces in the field are
to wear uniform or distinguishing badges. Without his
authority no civilian, European or native, will wear
any part of the uniform of the troops. Except in war-
fare against uncivilized enemies, arms will not be
issued to civilians.
5. All passes or licences issued to civilians are subject
to inspection and cancellation. No person, other
than a soldier on duty, will be allowed to pass through
an outpost line, or enter a work of defence, unless
in possession of a special pass given him for that purpose
and signed by an officer of the general staff.
6. The C.-in-C. may grant a civilian a pass entitling
such person to be treated on the footing of an officer
such as is referred to in Sec. 175 (7) of the A.A., but
such pass will not carry with it military title or power
of command, nor can a C.-in-C. grant a civilian a com-
mission, whether local or otherwise.
If a civilian is permitted to wear uniform he shall not
wear an officer's badges of rank.
7. No person employed by or accompanying the
forces in the field in a civil capacity is entitled, by
virtue of any military rank he may hold, to exercise
military command, or to claim the privileges and ad-
vantages of his rank.
8. All passes issued to civilians, other than press
correspondents, will be registered in a book kept by the
representative of the provost service with the head-
quarters of formations and areas.
