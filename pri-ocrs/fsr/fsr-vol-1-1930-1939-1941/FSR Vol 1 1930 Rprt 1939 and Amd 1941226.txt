6. The corps field ambulance, also organized in a
headquarters and two companies, may be employed in
action in the same manner as the divisional field ambu-
lances and to supplement them, or distributed in such
a manner as will best ensure the care and evacuation
of the wounded of corps troops, under the arrangements
made by the D.D.M.S. of the corps.
Alternatively it may be employed to form a corps
"walking wounded
collecting postly (w.W.CeP,) to which sightly wounded
cases able to proceed without assistance are directed
with the object of relieving the strain on divisional field
ambulances. During deliberate operations the corps
field ambulance may be utilized to open a " Corps rest
station" to which less serious cases of sickness and
wounds, not requiring prolonged treatment, are sent
from divisional field ambulances. By this means it is
possible to avoid flling up C.C.Ss. (see Sec. 118) with
minor hospital cases.
117. Motor ambulance convoys and ambulance car
companies (R.A.S.C.)
1. Motor ambulance convoys are normally employed
as follows :
i. In army areas, in the proportion of one for each
corps, for the purpose of clearing sick and
wounded from field ambulances to casualty
clearing stations, and from C.C.Ss. to ambu-
lance trains. For such purposes their use
is regulated by the representative of the
D.G.M.S. at an army headquarters.
