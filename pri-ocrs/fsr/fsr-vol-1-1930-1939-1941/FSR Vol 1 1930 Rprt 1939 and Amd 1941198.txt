a large reserve of material on account of the insecurity
of the L. of C. connecting it to the base, it may become
comparable in importance and scale with the base itself.
95. Auxiliary bases
The course of operations may lead to such an exten-
sion of the theatre as to include within it important new
centres of production. It will often be the case that
these new centres of production are so inconveniently
situated that the material to be obtained from them
cannot be easily absorbed by the normal chain of forward
supply through base to railhead. When this is the
case subsidiary L. of C. will be constituted as feeder lines
to the main Ls. of C. In such circumstances it will
usually be necessary to create depots for the receipt and
issue of the material in question at or near such centres
of production. These depots carry out functions identi-
cal with those of base depots and are termed auxiliary
depots. Normally they should be regarded as offshoots
of
base depots. When several services establish
auxiliary depots in the same neighbourhood, they will
together constitute an auxiliary base.
96. Railheads
1. Railheads are normally selected, in the first
instance, by the commander of the formation or area
which they are designed to serve. The railhead selected
is communicated by army or area commander's head-
quarters to G.H.Q. for ratification. Normally any
change in the allocation of railheads to formations
requires three days before it can be effected, but in
