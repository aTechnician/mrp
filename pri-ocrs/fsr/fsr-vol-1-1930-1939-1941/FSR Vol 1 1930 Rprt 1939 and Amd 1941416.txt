PRISONERS OF WAR, OR SICK
I. THE EFFECTS OF DECEASED AND MISSING PERSONNEL,
AND PERSONNEL REPORTED CAPTURED BY THE ENEMY
1. Anyone concerned in a burial, or finding a body,
will remove the red identity disc. The green identity
disc will on no account be removed from the body.
He will also remove A.B. 64, or, if the body is that of a
civilian, his pass and pay book, if any, together with all
other personal property found on the body. In cases
where there is only one identity disc it will not be
removed.
Should there be no means of identifying the body any
detail which may assist identification such as a cap
badge, shoulder title, or number marked on equipment,
should be carefully noted as well as the exact spot on
which the body was found and the apparent date of death.
Effects so collected will be handed in to the head-
quarters of the unit to which the individual collecting
them belongs.
2. On receipt at unit headquarters an inventory
of the effects will be made and checked by an officer,
who will dispose of them in the case of officers and nurses
