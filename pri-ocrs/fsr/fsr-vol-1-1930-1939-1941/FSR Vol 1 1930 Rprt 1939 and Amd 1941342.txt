194. Payment of officers
1. Officers who receive their pay through army agents
will remain in the payment of their agents on proceeding
on active service abroad. Officers who receive their
pay through command paymasters will be transferred
to the payment of the command paymaster at the base
from the date of embarkation.
2. Where necessary advances of pay may be issued to
officers by the field cashiers of their formations on officers'
advance books (A.F. W 3241 or R.A.F. Form 83 in the
case of R.A.F. officers). The maximum amount
of the advance and the number of advances which may
be made in a calendar month will be determined by the
C.-in-C. (in consultation with the paymaster-in-chief)
and published in G.R.Os.
The scale approved and any subsequent amendment
will be reported to the War Office for covering approval.
No advance should be made to any officer except on
production of his advance book, and the field cashier
making the advance will be responsible for verifying
from the previous counterfoils that the advance is within
the approved limits.
3. First issues of officers' advance books will be
demanded by Os.C. units from the field cashier of the
formation in which the unit is serving. In indenting
for the books the O.C. will furnish a nominal roll of the
officers requiring them, and will certify that the officers
named are serving with the unit. A statement of the
issues to individual officers supported by their receipts
will be sent to the field cashier as soon as the books have
