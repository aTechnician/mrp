The director of postal services may, in addition,
with the co-operation of the other services concerned,
organize a postal intercommunication system if required
and if the nature of the theatre of operations permits.
This will provide a more rapid means of postal inter-
communication between units and formations within
the theatre of operations than that provided by the
normal postal system which works in conjunction with
the system for delivery of supplies.
5. The service will be responsible for making all
postal arrangements in connection with the carriage of
correspondence, including parcels for the forces to, from
and within the theatre of operations, and in a friendly
country for such co-operation with the civil postal service
as may be advisable while remaining distinct from, and
independent of, such service. In a hostile country, and
in districts under martial law, the postal service will take
over the entire control and administration of the civil
postal service.
The efficiency of the postal service is dependent upon
receipt by the representatives of the director of postal
services of early and accurate information as to the
location of units and as to impending changes in the
chain of supply or evacuation. It is the duty of the
Q.M.G.'s branch to ensure that the postal service is kept
constantly supplied with this information.
6. The postal service will arrange for the registration
of official correspondence if certified by an officer or by
a N.C.O. specially authorized. It will whenever pos-
sible arrange also to extend to private correspondence
the facilities afforded by the civil post in peace
for registration and for the conveyance of money or
