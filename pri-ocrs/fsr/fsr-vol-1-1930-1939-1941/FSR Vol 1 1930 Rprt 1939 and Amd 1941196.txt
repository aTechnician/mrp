coming way-bills and finally cleared departmentally.
Any deficiencies of packages, bales, &c., will be reported
to the directorate of the delivering agency to enable
search to be made and those which cannot be rectified
will be adjusted by the head of the service concerned.
4. Issues are made from base depots in detail, or in
bulk, according to the category of material in accordance
with the principles laid down in Sec. 57. Stores pro-
vided by the supplies, medical and veterinary services,
and, with the exception of ammunition, by the ordnance
service, will normally, except when sent in bulk to
replenish stocks at advanced depots, be sent forward
by " pack" trains daily to railheads affiliated to forma-
tions. Pack trains are trains loaded to correspond in
detail as nearly as possible with demands received at
base depots from units and formations, but will be
made up as nearly as possible to full train loads (Sec.
57, 1). Ammunition,
engineer and transportation
stores, and in addition any stores required for issue
in large quantities for a special purpose, will normally-
be sent forward by full train loads to specially selected
railheads convenient for the user or set aside for the
class of material in question. Arrangements for the
despatch by rail of such stores will be made by the
movement control on the request of the officers com-
manding depots concerned.
5. Where the main L. of C. is by inland waterway,
the principles will be identical with those governing
communications by railway. In such cases " pack"
barges or other craft will be loaded and despatched
daily to riverheads, affiliated to formations, for material
despatched in detail.
