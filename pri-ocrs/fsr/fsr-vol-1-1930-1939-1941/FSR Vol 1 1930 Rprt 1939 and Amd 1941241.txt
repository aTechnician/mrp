use should be made of unwounded prisoners to supple-
ment the stretcher-bearer personnel, both of regimental
units and of the medical service, in the transport of
wounded to the rear. (See Sec. 125, 4.)
It will usually be found convenient to arrange a

area of each division in action, and one in each corps
area, will usually suffice. Prisoners will be sent by
units capturing them direct to divisional collecting
posts, where their custody will be assumed by the provost
service. Thence they will be evacuated to corps
collecting posts under escorts furnished under corps
arrangements. Examination may take place at corps
or divisional collecting posts as may be ordered, but

rolls (para. 3, above) will not be carried out in front of
the corps collecting post.

results, and for that reason, as well as for reasons of
humanity, arrangements should be made for supplying
food and drink to such prisoners of war as are manifestly
