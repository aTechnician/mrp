CLAIMS COMMISSION
200. Functions of a claims commission
1. In any theatre where British forces are present, a
claims commission may be set up to deal with claims of
inhabitants arising out of accidents to person or property,
pillage, theft, fires alleged to have been caused by the
British troops, damage to occupied buildings and to
land and crops through training or man≈ìuvres and
other claims not arising from hirings, purchases or other
commercial transactions, including billeting and re-
quisitions. The claims commission may act as a court
of appeal in cases of dispute arising out of hirings,
purchases, requisitions, &c., which the troops and
services are unable to settle satisfactorily.
2. Such a claims commission will have as its president
a military officer of adequate rank, especially selected
by the War Office for experience in military adminis-
tration. He will be in direct communication with the
financial heads of the War Office and will be given
special financial powers within limits appropriate to the
conditions of the campaign. In suitable cases a civil
member of special standing may be appointed to the
Claims Commission by the War Office, e.g., a member of
one of the Houses of Parliament, but the other members
of the Commission will generally be military officers of
number and rank adequate to the occasion.
3. In case of operations in the territory of an allied
power, the War Office will arrange for recognition by
such power of the status of the Claims Commission and
of the finality of its decisions; and suitable arrangements
