collection and treatment of sick and wounded of corps
troops.
When a brigade, or smaller body of troops, is detached
from the division a field ambulance, or one of its com-
panies, may be allotted temporarily to it and will work
with it.
2. Field ambulances will be employed according to
arrangements made by the D.D.M.S. of the corps, or
the A.D.M.S. of the division as the case may be. For
an action such arrangements will normally be included
in operation orders or in administrative instructions
issued in connection with operation orders. (See
Appendix VII, Volume II, 1929.)
3. The normal duty in action of field ambulances is
that of forming dressing stations and of conveying the
wounded from R.A. Ps. to those dressing stations.
116. Dressing stations
1. Dressing stations for the early treatment of
wounded and for affording attention under cover to as
many seriously wounded as possible are of two kinds :â€”
i. Advanced dressing stations (A.D.S.).
ii. Main dressing stations (M.D.S.).
2. Advanced dressing stations are formed as far
forward as operations permit, and will be always in
touch with R.A.Ps. They will be sited at localities
accessible to ambulance transport, or alternatively
served by tramway or trolley line, and affording the
greatest possible degree of protection. The number to
be formed will depend on the circumstances of the action,
but normally one or at most two advanced dressing
stations for each main dressing station should suffice.
