[Chap. XVI, Secs. 144 and 145.
7. No troops other than orderlies and parties for water,
wood, forage, &c., are to quit their areas without leave.
8. If a state of constant readiness is ordered, troops
will not leave their quarters unless fully accoutred and
will sleep with their arms by their sides. It may even
be necessary that horses should be kept saddled and
harnessed.
145. Hygiene and sanitation
1. The commander of every formation and unit in the
field will be responsible for the sanitary condition of
the area occupied by his command, irrespective of the
period for which it may be occupied, and for the
enforcement of all orders regarding health and sanitation.
2. The medical service will be responsible for advice
and supervision, and for such technical work as is
beyond the capacity of the troops, but it is the duty of
all officers to ensure that the measures laid down in the
Army Manual of Sanitation for the preservation of the
health and fighting efficiency of the troops are carried
out by all ranks under their command.
3. The following points will require special attention :
i. The highest standard of cooking possible under
field service conditions will be maintained,
in order that health and power of resistance
to disease may be preserved.
ii. The supply of pure drinking water is a vital factor
in maintaining the health of a force. Sources
of pure water will be protected from contam-
ination, and water discipline will be enforced
to prevent men drinking impure water.
