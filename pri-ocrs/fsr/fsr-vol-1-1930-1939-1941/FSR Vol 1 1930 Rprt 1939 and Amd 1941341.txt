[Chap. XXI, Sec. 193.
7. In order to avoid undue loss of cash in case of
capture by the enemy, accident or other circumstance,
requisitions for cash will be restricted to actual immediate
requirements.
8. Imprest holders will keep an account in duplicate
on A.F. N 1531A. On the last day of every month
(unless otherwise arranged in consultation with the
paymaster-in-chief) the account will be balanced and
the original forwarded forthwith, accompanied by sup-
porting vouchers, to the paymaster i/c clearing house,
the carbon copy being kept for reference. The account
should be a simple record of actual cash transactions,
but care must be taken to bring to account all sums
received from whatever source, and to ensure that all
items are duly vouched. The proper forms should be
used whenever possible, but informal accounts, if
unavoidable owing to the conditions of active service,
will be accepted provided that all essential information
is given. If in exceptional cases it is impossible or
inexpedient to obtain the receipt of a payee, a certificate
to that effect and a brief statement of the transaction
should be substituted.
9. An imprest holder's account books and records will
be open at all times to the inspection of the paymaster-
in-chief or his representative.
10. Imprest holders should make every endeavour
to render their accounts as regularly and completely
as possible.
11. If an imprest holder finds it necessary to open a
public banking account he should report the fact forth-
with to the paymaster-in-chief.
