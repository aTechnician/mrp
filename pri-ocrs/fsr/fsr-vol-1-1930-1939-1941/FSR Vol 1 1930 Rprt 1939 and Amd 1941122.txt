representative of the movement control in a L. of C.
area and the commander of the area. When the number
of reinforcements to be sent forward is small all arrange-
ments for despatch may be made direct between the
commander of a base depot and the representative of
the movement control at the entraining station serving
that depot. How far it may be possible to leave such
arrangements to be concluded locally in this manner will
depend upon circumstances, and will be decided mutually
between the senior representative of the movement
section in an area and its commander.
4. Drafts are sent to the front fully clothed, armed and
equipped, and will take with them rations sufficient
to last for the estimated duration of the journey, and in
the absence of special instructions on this point, one day
in addition. The movement control is responsible for
arranging for facilities to be provided for the preparation
and consumption of rations during the journey (see Sec.
30, 4).
53. Base depots for personnel
1. Base depots are provided and organized, as detailed
in war establishments. They are located by the Q.M.G.'s
branch in consultation with the A.G.'s branch (see
Sec. 31, 1) on the L. of C.
2. If several base depots are grouped in one locality
an officer, termed O.C. reinforcements, may be appointed
to command the group. When such an officer is
appointed he will be responsible to the area, or sub-
area, commander for all matters of local administration
affecting his command and to the officer i/c 2nd echelon
for matters of general administration.
