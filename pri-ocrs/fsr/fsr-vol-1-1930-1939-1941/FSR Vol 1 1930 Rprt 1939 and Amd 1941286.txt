5. On the march or in action, the various echelons
should be so situated that when an engagement takes
place a regular system of supply can at once begin
Each echelon must be constantly aware of the position
of, and be in communication with, the echelon next in
front of it, so that the quantity and nature of ammuni-
tion wanted can be sent forward promptly to the points
required.
All expenditure from ammunition echelons must be
replaced immediately. Each echelon will therefore
assist by keeping the echelon behind informed of changes
in location.
6. During the initial stages of an attack on a large
scale, the artillery expenditure will usually be greater
than can be replaced immediately. Preparations for the
attack must, therefore, include the placing at the guns
or at forward dumps, of sufficient ammunition to ensure
that echelons remain full after the estimated initial
expenditure.
No more ammunition will be dumped at the guns than
will be required to be fired from initial gun positions.
If it is estimated that during subsequent stages of the
attack the expenditure will exceed the available output
from ammunition refilling points, special arrangements
must be made for forward dumps. In selecting sites for
these, their suitability as future ammunition refilling
points should be considered. Ammunition companies
and maintenance companies may be required to work
continuously when the time and opportunities for dump-
ing are limited. This supply will usually have to take
place during the hours of darkness.
