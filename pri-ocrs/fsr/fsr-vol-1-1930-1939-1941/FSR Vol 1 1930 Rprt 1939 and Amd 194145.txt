commander. Garrisons and posts the
latter being small garrisons at minor points of import-
ance) will be regarded as subordinate formations of the
area and the area commander is responsible for the
distribution of the troops placed at his disposal by
G.H.Q. to each in accordance with defence requirements.
7. The extent of each sub-area on the L. of C. will
be determined rather by the concentration of general
administrative activity within its bounds than by any
other factor. Thus a locality containing important
depots, while comparatively small in extent, will usually
be organized as a sub-area. On the other hand, a large
district, populous and of great importance to civilian
interests, may contain few or no military installations,
and such a district, however great in extent, will usually
be organized as a single sub-area.
8. Staff officers and town majors will be appointed
by authority of G.H.Q. when required to assist base,
sub-area and garrison commanders.
9. Boundaries of areas and sub-areas must be clearly
defined when they are formed and should be modified
as seldom as possible. A boundary should be so drawn
that all towns, roads, villages, or military installations,
are definitely on one side. Roads, rivers and railways
are therefore generally unsuitable as boundaries, but
if so used the authority responsible for the local ad-
ministration of the traffic carried by them must be clearly
stated.
10. G.H.Q. will be responsible for the issue of maps
of the whole theatre of operations defining the area
