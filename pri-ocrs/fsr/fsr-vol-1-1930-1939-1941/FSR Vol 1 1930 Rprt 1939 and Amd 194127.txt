6. It is essential that this doctrine should be regarded
by all ranks as authoritative. Its principles, evolved
by experience of war, must be so thoroughly impressed
on the mind of every commander that, whenever he
has to come to a decision in the field, he automatically
gives them their full weight. In this way only will
subordinates be able to act in accordance with their
superior's views and decide on the right course without
frequent reference to him, and even without receiving
his orders.
7. It is the duty of all commanders to ensure adherence
to the approved organization of the units under their
command, and to the principles of training, leadership
and administration set forth in these regulations. The
war establishments of all branches of the Army, and the
training and war manuals of the various arms, issued
by the Army Council, are based on these regulations,
which are the ruling authority in cases of doubt.
Where this manual differs from " The Employ-
ment of Air Forces with the Army in the Field," the
instructions contained in the latter will be followed.
