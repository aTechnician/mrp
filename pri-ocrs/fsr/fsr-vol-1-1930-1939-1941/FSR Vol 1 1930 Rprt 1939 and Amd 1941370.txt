[Appendix II. .
commences to leave the COLLEGE at 1310 hours. The
remainder of the column halts at 1230 hours as the head
of the field brigade R.A. reaches a point ½ mile north
of the WHEATSHEAF HOTEL. The march is resumed
at 1330 hours and the head of the field brigade R.A.
reaches the COLLEGE at 1350 hours, and is thus close
up to the infantry brigade. If desired, the field brigade
R.A., &c., might have resumed the march 10 minutes
later than shown and would, by omitting the 1350 hours
short halt, still be able to regain their position behind
the infantry brigade.
12. The arrival of units at HOUNSLOW HEATH
is shown at the top of the graph.
13. If a message is received from the O.C. a cavalry
regiment at WINDSOR, saying that his regiment has
been ordered to march to PIRBRIGHT via NEW
EGHAM and CHOBHAM, and asking at what hour he
can cross the route of the mixed force at NEW EGHAM,
the graph shows that the cross roads ¾ mile south of the
college will be clear of traffic up to 1205 hours, between
1245 hours and 1345 hours and after 1430 hours.
The O.C. cavalry regiment is informed and can arrange
his march accordingly.
14. As the graph gives, approximately, all time and
space data affecting the march, it can be of use in many
ways. For example, if the commander wishes to divert
any unit at any point, the graph shows the latest hour at
which the orders must reach the unit to enable it to be
diverted without reversing and so interrupting the march
of units in rear. Again, the graph can be of assistance
in the selection of suitable billets in depth.
