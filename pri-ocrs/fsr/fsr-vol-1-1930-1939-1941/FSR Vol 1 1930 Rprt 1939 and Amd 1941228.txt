Of the wounded admitted to field medical

pected to be walking cases, 35 per cent. sitting
cases and 25 per cent. lying-down cases.
118. Casualty clearing stations
1. Casualty clearing stations (C.C.Ss.) are provided in
the theatre of operations on the scale of one for each
division. They are allotted either as army troops or,
in a small force (if an army headquarters is not included),
as G.H.Q. troops.
2. The function of the C.C.S. is to receive sick and
wounded from field ambulances, and direct from troops
in their vicinity. They form the first link in the
evacuating zone and are the pivot upon which the whole
system of evacuating sick and wounded turns. (See
Sec. 112.)
3. A C.C.S. includes a " light section." This can
be detached for the purpose of establishing an " advanced
operating centre," the equipment of which is capable
of being transported in ten 3-ton lorries. First line
transport of a C.C.S. consists of two 3-ton lorries
only. It is therefore 'an immobile unit, and on change
of location is dependent on transport supplied for the
purpose under arrangements made by formation com-
manders.
4. Casualty clearing stations will be located by forma-
tion commanders, in accordance with the following
conditions :
i. A C.C.S. will be located not nearer than 1,000
yards from any large railway junction, viaduct,
depot, park, or dump containing material.
