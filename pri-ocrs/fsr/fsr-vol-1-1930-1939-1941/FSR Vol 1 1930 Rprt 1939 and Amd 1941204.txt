3. The organization of road transport by units, and
the normal allotment and duties of the units, are given
in Secs. 100-103.
4. The general control of road transport is the duty of
formation and area commanders, and is exercised directly
by orders issued by them direct to commanders of trans-
port units or groups of such units.
5. The normal system of forward supply entails the
organization of road transport in advance of railhead in
three links of a chain, each link having a carrying
capacity of one day's requirements in all material,
the supply of which to the troops is made daily. In
certain cases, where the units to be supplied are not
normally required by the nature of their tasks to be
far removed from railhead, two links, or even one link,
of the road transport chain will suffice and the transport
provided in war establishments has been organized
accordingly.
In the case of ammunition, which may be required by
the troops at varying intervals and in varying quantities
according to operations in progress, three links of road
transport are provided.
6. The three links of road transport forward from
railhead are (see Secs. 100-102) :-
i. Third line transport.
ii. Second line transport.
iii. First line transport.
7. Each link normally delivers to the link in front
of it at selected points termed " refilling points" and
" delivery points" (for definitions see pages xvi and xvii).
