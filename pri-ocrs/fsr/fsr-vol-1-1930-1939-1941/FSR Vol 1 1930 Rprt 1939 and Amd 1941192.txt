Animals on arrival will be disembarked by an embarka-
tion staff officer (E.S.O.), and taken over a quayside by
the remount service.
5. Animals taken over by the remount service from
local resources or veterinary units will be drafted
to the nearest remount depot. In order to avoid
unnecessary movement or to take advantage of good
grazing, it will usually be advisable to establish remount
depots, termed " auxiliary remount depots," in
proximity to centres of supply of this nature. Such
depots, which may be situated as convenient, should be
regarded as detachments from base depots and as
carrying out similar functions.
6. Advanced remount depots will only be required
when conditions demand the establishment of an
advanced base for other purposes (Sec. 88, 9).
7. In all depots accommodation for animals will be
constructed, as a works service, so as to provide the
best possible conditions compatible with circumstances.
Whenever possible
divided standings with floors,
mangers, head-cover and water troughs will be provided,
together with accessory buildings and plant such as
forage stores, forges, chaffing and corn-cutting
machinery. The rapid conditioning of animals for
service with units demands care in the design and
equipment of stabling; stabling can only be dispensed
with economically in dry, hot climates.
8. Animals are drafted to formations on a consolidated
indent and distributed to units by the representative
of the remount service with the army or corps head-
quarters. Indents, consolidated by divisions, will
