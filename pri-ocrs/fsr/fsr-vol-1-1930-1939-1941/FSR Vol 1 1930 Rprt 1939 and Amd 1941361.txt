iii. As an analysis.
Examples:â€” Casualty diagrams to show num-
bers of killed, wounded, missing,
sick, transfers, &c.
Enemy strength in various
theatres of war.
The most common use of time and space graphs
is to show the position of troops on the march at any
time.
II.-METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION
1. Graphs are made on squared paper. The corner
of a square, usually the left-hand bottom corner, is
taken as origin, and from it two lines are drawn at
right angles. The divisions on the horizontal line are
taken to represent units of time (e.g., hours, days,
months, &c.), which appear in every graph. The other
factor to be shown (e.g., space, numbers, &c.) 1S
represented by the divisions on the vertical line. On
every graph it must be clearly indicated along each
line what divisions actually represent.
The figures supplied by the data, or derived from
calculations, are then plotted on the graph in the form
of a series of points, each representing the relation of a
number on the horizontal line to one on the vertical
line. These points are then joined together by a line
or curve. Information required at any intermediate
point can then be read off. An example will make this
clear.
