and delivery of ammunition from ammunition base
depots to railheads and to army or corps reserve dumps.
The issuing and handling of the ammunition at railheads
and at reserve dumps is the responsibility of the
D.M.G.O.
2. The staff is responsible for the delivery of ammuni-
tion from railhead or reserve dumps as far forward as
the selected delivery points; in the case of S.A.A.,
grenades and light signals, these will normally be the
infantry brigade reserves.
3. Once contact has been established with the enemy,
ammunition must always be available for replacement of
expenditure. To ensure this, one or two days' antici-
pated requirements will be held under G.H.Q. control
either in railway trucks under load at or close to ammuni-
tion railheads, or in dumps in the vicinity of ammunition
railheads, so as to be available for the quick replenish-
ment of maintenance companies. The amount of these
stocks will be determined, and their location fixed, by the
General Staff at G.H.Q. in consultation with the Q.M.G.'s
branch as regards transportation requirements, and the
M.G.O.'s branch as regards provision.
Issues will be made from these stocks by ordnance
officers at ammunition railheads against demands. Such
issues and stocks remaining on hand will be reported
daily by R.A.O.C. officers at ammunition railhead to
D.M.G.O., G.H.Q.
4. Where abnormal expenditure is probable in any
projected operation, the artillery commander of a forma-
tion, after consultation with the general staff, will
estimate the quantity of artillery ammunition required.
