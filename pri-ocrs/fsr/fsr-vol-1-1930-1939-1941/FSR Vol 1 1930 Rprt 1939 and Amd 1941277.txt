mounted police, will be sent forward to select, in con-
junction with an engineer and a medical officer, and with
due regard to tactical considerations, water supply,
&c., the ground where the force is to pass the night.
He will make all necessary arrangements for the dis-
tribution of the troops on their arrival.
2. When the column arrives within two or three miles
of its destination staff officers of brigades, &c., accom-
panied by representatives of their units, will proceed
ahead, receive instructions concerning arrangements
for the night, lead their units on arrival direct to the
ground allotted to them, and explain the arrangements
to commanders of units.
3. The procedure on arrival of the troops will be as
described in Sec. 144.
4. Where bodies of troops are camped or bivouacked
close together, the general position of the latrines and
kitchens of each area will be settled by the senior officer
present in consultation with the responsible medical
officer; that is to say, it will be decided whether they are
to be in front, at the rear, or on the flank of an area.
