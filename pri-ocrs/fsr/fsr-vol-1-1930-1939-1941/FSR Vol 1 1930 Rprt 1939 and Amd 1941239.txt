on all ranks. Officer i/c 2nd echelon will issue general
instructions as to the disposal of the personal effects
of prisoners of war. Those which they are allowed to
retain will accompany them to their place of intern-
ment, or, if wounded, to hospital. (See Appendix VI.)
An inventory of the personal effects will be made on
A.F. W 3000, Part I.
3. Unwounded prisoners, after being examined, will
be formed into suitable batches by an officer of the
provost service, and sent to the rear in charge of escorts
furnished by the troops under arrangements made by
the A.G.'s branch.
An officer will normally be detailed to be in charge of
each batch of prisoners, and will be responsible for their
safe custody and that of their personal effects. He will
be furnished with a nominal roll in duplicate of the
prisoners in his batch, one copy to be handed to the
commandant of the place of internment and one copy
to be signed by that officer and retained by the officer
in charge of the escort as his receipt for the due delivery
of the prisoners.
All prisoners will be warned that anyone resisting
the escort, or attempting to escape, will be shot.
4. Wounded prisoners will be evacuated under the
same arrangements as are made for the evacuation of our
own casualties.
The medical service will collect all papers from
wounded prisoners and prepare a nominal roll in dupli-
cate at dressing stations. Papers so collected and one
copy of the nominal roll will be sent to the general staff
of the nearest formation at the earliest opportunity.
