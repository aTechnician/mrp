in advance of, ambulance railhead for the reception of
serious cases which it would be inadvisable to evacuate
to the L. of C. Where the L. of C. is long or for any
other reason an advanced base is established, it may be
advisable to group a proportion of general hospitals
in the advanced base area for the reception of cases
the invaliding of which from the theatre of operations
is not likely.
3. The principles laid down in Sec. 118, 4, for the
location of C.C.Ss. will be applied generally to that of
general hospitals.
122. Convalescent depots
1. Convalescent depots are intended for the reception
of officers and men who require no further active medical
or surgical treatment, and who, though not yet fit for
duty with their units, are likely to become so in a reason-
able time.
2. Convalescent depots are of two classes, each having
a distinct and definite role.
They are:
i. Advanced convalescent depots.-These should be
located near railheads to relieve the pressure
on casualty clearing stations and enable
them to move at short notice.
11. Convalescent depots established to relieve the
pressure on general hospitals so that adequate
accommodation may always be available
for serious cases coming from the front, and
to harden convalescents by graduated exercise
under medical supervision before rejoining
their units.
