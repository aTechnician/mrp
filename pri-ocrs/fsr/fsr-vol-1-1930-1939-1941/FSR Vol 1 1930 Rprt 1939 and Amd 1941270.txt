been decided by the general staff branch, any necessary
adjustment of the areas in detail can be carried out by
the Q.M.G.'s branch.
4. Whenever possible billeting parties will be sent
ahead of the troops to make the necessary detailed
arrangements with the local authorities, or, if such
officers have already been appointed, with the area
commandants or town majors. In the case of a large
formation, such as a division, it is advisable to send
forward
an advanced billeting party, consisting of
representatives of brigades and divisional troops in
charge of an officer of the divisional staff, to make the
preliminary arrangements, this party being followed
by billeting parties from each unit of the formation.
In such cases the divisional staff officer will divide
roughly the allotted area amongst infantry brigades,
&c., and representatives of these, will, in turn, allot.
certain streets or groups of houses to their units.
