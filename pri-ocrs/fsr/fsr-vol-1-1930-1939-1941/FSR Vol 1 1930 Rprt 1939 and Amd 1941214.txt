When troops go into action it may be necessary to
arrange for additional food to be carried on the man.
Orders to this effect will be issued as part of operation
orders.
5. When large quantities of petrol are to be dealt
with in bulk, special arrangements will be necessary
for its receipt in a theatre of operations, its storage,
distribution and issue. Petrol in bulk should be treated
separately from other supplies until it is canned, under
arrangements made by the D.S.T.
Separate depots should normally be used for petrol
only and, when in bulk, separate railheads should be
used. Where issues justify this course it may be
conveyed to railhead by special petrol trains. When in
cans, however, the forward supply of petrol may be
arranged with that of other supplies, using the rail-
heads common to all material forwarded by pack train.
6. In the case of a division, or cavalry division, no
hard-and-fast rules can be laid down as to the times at
which the transfer of supplies between the three links
of transport should take place. The principle to be
followed is that :â€”
i. Each link should be refilled as soon as possible
after it is empty.
ii. The pack train must be cleared as early as pos-
sible after arrival at railhead.
In the case of formations on the move the first line
transport (cookers) can seldom be empty before evening.
Consequently second line transport cannot discharge at
delivery points the supplies for consumption on the
following day before evening. Second line transport
