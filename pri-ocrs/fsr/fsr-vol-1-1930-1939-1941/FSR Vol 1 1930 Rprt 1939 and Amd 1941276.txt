150. Close billets
In close billets, as many men and animals as possible
are billeted ; the remainder bivouac.
This system is adopted when a greater degree of readi-
ness is required than is possible in ordinary billets.
For this reason tactical considerations have precedence
over all other considerations, and arms and units will
never be mixed. As such billets will, normally, be
used for short periods only, it is not necessary to consider
the interests of the inhabitants to the same extent as
in ordinary billets. Where close billets have to be
occupied for any length of time, it is advisable to remove
the inhabitants and accommodate them outside the
zone of operations.
In other respects the instructions for billets apply to
close billets.
SPECIAL MEASURES IN CAMPS AND BIVOUACS
151. General rules
1. The instructions in the following sections, where
camps are referred to, are only applicable in their
entirety to those camps where administrative considera-
tions predominate over tactical requirements. Where
attack from the air is possible, modifications must be
made in accordance with Sec. 141, 7.
2. The site for a camp or bivouac should be dry, and
on grass if possible. Steep siopes must be avoided,
but gentle slopes facilitate drainage. Large woods with
undergrowth, low meadows, the bottoms of narrow
valleys, and newly turned soil are apt to be unhealthy.
Clay is usually damp. Ravines and water-courses are
