1. Orders for the collection, custody, and disposal
of prisoners of war will be issued by the A.G.s branch
of the staff, which is responsible for ensuring compliance
with the terms of international conventions. Officer
i/c 2nd echelon will arrange for the registration of
prisoners of war as soon as possible after capture. He
will decide at what point the arrangements for registra-
tion (see para. 5, below) will come into operation, and
will issue to prisoner of war units and medical units
books of A.F. W 3000 (Descriptive Report of Enemy
Prisoner of War). He will maintain a record of such
issues and notify these to the Prisoners of War Informa-

in the event of death or when retention is likely to exceed
5 days.
