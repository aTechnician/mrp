6. Individual officers and men sent forward from
base depots to join units independently will be given a
" movement order." This order, which will always be
in writing, may take any convenient form, but will
invariably bear the signature of a responsible official
as authority for the movement, and the number, if
any, rank, name and unit of the bearer. No destination
will be stated if the bearer is to join a unit of a field
formation, but in other cases, such as that of an installa-
tion on the L. of C., a destination will be given.
It is the duty of the transportation service to arrange
the movement of an individual officer or man
in
accordance with a duly authorized movement order
presented to an officer of the movement section of the
staff, or of the service.
7. It is to be anticipated that, however carefully
individuals are directed, there will always be a certain
number ignorant of their destinations, and lacking
movement orders. When such individuals are found,
their cases will be investigated by the provost service,
or, if found on railway or other transportation service
premises, by the local movement control officer. If their
cases can be satisfactorily explained new movement
orders will be issued to them signed by the movement
control officer, and they will be despatched to their
destinations, which in the forward area will be the recep-
tion depot, and in the base area the base depot affiliated
to their unit or corps.
