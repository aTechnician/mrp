Royal Artillery) and will be organized in the following
units iâ€”
i. Remount squadrons.
ii. Remount depot headquarters.
4. Details in connection with the working of the

76. Supplies and transport service
1. The supplies service is responsible for supply of
food, forage, petrol, fuel, lubricants for mechanically
propelled vehicles, light, disinfectants and medical
comforts to the forces in the field.
The transport service is responsible for the supply
and maintenance of all mechanical transport vehicles
driven by R.A.S.C. personnel. It is responsible for
replacements by complete turnouts of all first line horse
transport required by all arms. It is also charged with
the duty of inspecting all mechanical transport vehicles
supplied by the R.A.S.C. and for this purpose a branch
termed the M.T. Inspection Branch, R.A.S.C., will be
established.
2. The supplies and transport services are normally
combined in one service, under a head of the service
styled the Director of Supplies and Transport (D.S.T.).
He is represented at army and corps headquarters and
at the headquarters of a L. of C. area.
The immediate subordinates of the director at G.H.Q.
and of his representatives belong respectively to the
supplies service and to the transport service, and through-
out their organization the duties and control of the two
services of supplies and transport are separate. For
convenience, however, the personnel of each are nor-
mally located together in combined units.
