[Chap. XIV, Sec. 90.
concerned by the embarkation staff officer (E.S.O.),
personnel will proceed on disembarkation direct to base
depots. These base depots will be established if possible
within easy marching distance of disembarkation quays.
Where this is not possible, special arrangements will
be made by the base area commander for the conveyance
of personnel from quayside to depot, but such arrange-
ments should not involve a journey by railway.
4. Parties of reinforcements sent forward on orders
by the officer i/c 2nd echelon will normally be conveyed
by special trains, or inland water craft, under arrange-
ments made by the transportation service, to railheads.
In principle the forward movement of reinforcements
will be kept distinct from that of material, and they
will be detrained at railheads specially selected for
their suitability, and, if possible, not in use as railheads
for any other purpose.
5. Reception camps (Sec. 54) will be affiliated to
reinforcement railheads and located within convenient
marching distance of them. Arrangements to be made
for the forward movement of personnel from the reception
camp to the unit will vary with the circumstances of the
theatre of operations, but they will normally take the
form of organized convoys passed on from stage to stage
by area and formation commanders. Convoying per-
sonnel will be provided from units under arrange-
ments made by formation commanders.
Where for any reason convoys cannot be organized,
formation commanders will arrange for reinforcements to
be conveyed to units with the daily supplies (see Sec.
99, 5), but this method is open to objection and will
be adopted only in case of necessity.
