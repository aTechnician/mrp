The daily strength state of units (A.F. W 3006) will be consoli-
dated in terms of units at Div. H.Q. on A.F. W 3007, the necessary
deductions being first made from the total strengths to arrive
at the fighting strengths.
The deductions which should be made
will be notified from time to time as may be necessary by the general
staff. The consolidated fighting strength of the Div. will be trans-
â€¢
strength, thence to G.H.Q. for consolidation of the fighting strength
of the whole fighting force in the field. G.H.Q. will send daily a
copy of the consolidated strength to the War Office. This procedure
will result in all commanders and the War Office having a daily
knowledge of the approximate fighting state of the forces in the
field.
Note. The consolidation at corps and army H.Q. and G.H.Q.
should be in bulk, i.e., by Divs., Corps and Armies.
