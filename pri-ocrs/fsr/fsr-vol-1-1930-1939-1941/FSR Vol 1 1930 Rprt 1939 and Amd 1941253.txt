[Chap. XV, Secs. 137 and 138.
been formed, special salvage collections will be organ-
ized as mentioned in Sec. 138, 4, and the clearance of
dumps collected by the troops when carrying out routine
salvage (Sec. 138, 2) will be similarly effected; all un-
sorted salvaged stores evacuated to the base will be
dealt with at the ordnance base depot. On the other
hand in a great war, as operations progress, the salvage
work will assume daily a greater importance and the
organization for dealing with it, small in the opening
stages, must be built up as required into a connected and
efficient whole.
9. Any labour which cannot be provided by the
troops will be demanded from the labour service and
provided by the latter as laid down in Sec. 71.
138. Salvage coilection
1. The collection of salvage is of two natures, namely
that of :â€”
i. Routine salvage.
ii. Special salvage.
2. When conditions permit, routine salvage is an
everyday duty of the troops. It consists of the collec-
tion of abandoned or captured material of all natures
into salvage dumps. The responsibility for organizing
the work in areas occupied by units rests with command-
ing officers.
The duty of returning to service any stores rendered
unserviceable but not abandoned, and any containers
no longer required, the return of which has been ordered
in routine orders, will be effected normally through the
same channels as are utilized by the services concerned
