[Chap. XII, Sec. 71.
5. Civilian labour units consist of hired personnel, if
of a friendly or allied nationality, or of requisitioned
personnel if from a hostile population. Hired personnel
will be obtained in the open market either individually,
or through a local contractor, chief, or headman, and
requisitioned labour through local authorities in accor-
dance with the regulations for requisitioning (Chapter
XIX). In either case civilian labour units are governed
by the rules for civilians laid down in Chapter XX.
6. To obtain the best results from the labour service,
it is necessary that :-
i. As great a proportion of labour as possible
should be retained in a fluid state, capable of
allocation at short notice to different employ-
ments in accordance with the varying re-
quirements at different places in the theatre of
operations and at different times.
ii. Labour units should be employed continu
ously on the same type of work.
A large proportion of the labour corps in a theatre of
operations requires therefore to be for general service and
unskilled. The existence of a large number of specialized
units such as those mentioned in para. 4, above, tends
inevitably to reduce the fluidity of labour and to be
wasteful of personnel.
7. To economize the strength of labour required for
any particular work, it is essential that the movement of
all material should be so organized as to require the
minimum number of handlings in transit. It is also
