point D at 4,000 rations and immediately above Ist
January. By 11th, 1,000 rations will have been con-
sumed and 3,000 will remain. Plot the point E opposite
3,000 and above 10th January. On the 11th, 100
rations will be consumed and 500 will arrive. The
balance remaining will therefore be 3,400. Plot the
point F.
From 12th to 14th inclusive consumption will be at
the rate of 100 rations per diem, and from the 15th to
20th at 300 rations per diem. Plot the points G and
H to show the balance in hand on 14th and 20th
respectively, namely 3,100 and 1,300.
After 20th the consumption will be at the rate of 100
rations per diem, so that on 30th a balance of 300 will
remain. Plot point J.
Join points D E F G H J by a line.
From this line the balance in hand at any date between
1st and 30th January can now be read off.
By prolonging the line HJ until it meets OB, it will
be seen that, unless further supplies are received, all
rations will have been consumed by the evening of lst
February.
3. Fig. 2 shows the march of a column 1 mile long
marching at 3 miles an hour.
The vertical line OA represents the element of distance
and is marked off in suitable divisions, e.g., miles and
half-miles.
The horizontal line OB is marked off in divisions of
time, e.g., hours, sub-divided into periods of 10 minutes.
The point O represents the starting point of the head
of the column.
After 20 minutes the head will be 1 mile from the
