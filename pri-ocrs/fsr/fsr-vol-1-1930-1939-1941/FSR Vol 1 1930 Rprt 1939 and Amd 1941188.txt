elapse before this lay-out can be operated for the main-
tenance of the army. It is therefore essential to begin by
making a temporary lay-out for immediate use, distinct
from the lay-out intended for permanent maintenance.
It may be possible to use a separate port for temporary
maintenance, but if, as is more likely, no alternative
port is available for this purpose, sites must be set aside
for temporary maintenance purposes which will interfere
as little as possible with the development of the per-
manent base organization.
7. It will be the duty of the War Office, in consultation
with the C.-in-C., to indicate the general scheme upon
which the L. of C. shall be constructed. This will
include the selection of the base port or ports to be
used, a suggested lay-out of the base, the development of
railway and other communications and information
regarding the probable rate and extent of expansion of
the force.
PERSONNEL AND ANIMALS
90. Replenishment of personnel
1. The system of replacement of personnel in the
field has been dealt with in Chapter X. Whenever
possible particular ports will be reserved for the landing
of personnel, but when this is not possible a suitable
section of one or more ports in general use will be set
aside for the landing of personnel.
2. Transports
on arrival will be boarded by an
embarkation staff officer (E.S.O.) under whose orders the
disembarkation will be effected
3. Unless orders for direct movement inland have
been received and communicated to troops or individuals
