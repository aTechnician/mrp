These sub-sections are so organized that the
requisite number and type of lorries are de-
tachable to the ammunition company and
maintenance company of the formation to
which these brigades may be allotted, or in
whose area they may be operating.
4. Divisional ammunition units.-
i. An ammunition company forms part of the
Royal Army Service Corps organization of
every division.
ii. The company is designed to supply ammunition
to units. It is sub-divided into company
headquarters and three sections. Each sec-
tion is identical in organization and carries a
proportion of each type of ammunition used
by the division, including S.A.A. grenades
and explosives.
iii. The location of the divisional ammunition com-
pany is dictated by tactical requirements.
In principle it should be kept concentrated
and be located in an area sufficiently far
forward to ensure rapid delivery of ammuni-
tion on demand. The tactical situation, the
distances to be covered, congestion or lack
of roads, or other considerations may, how-
ever, necessitate portions of the divisional
ammunition company being detached and
located in more forward positions. These
detachments may vary from a few lorries to
a complete section or sections.
