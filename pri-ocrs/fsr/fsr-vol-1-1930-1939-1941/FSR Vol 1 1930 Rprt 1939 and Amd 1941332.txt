offices or labour depots as may be necessary. The
Q.M.G.'s branch is responsible for engaging local labour
on a civilian basis. The co-ordination of all arrange-
ments in connection with civilian labour will be the
duty of the director of labour (see Sec. 71).
Subject to these conditions civilians will, as required,
be engaged under the authority of the heads of services,
either through a contractor or by direct engagement
through employment offices and labour depots. This
rule does not apply to persons employed by the general
staff branch, who are engaged under special arrange-
ments to be made by that branch.
Native labour is usually obtained by negotiation
with the tribal chiefs.
The instructions contained in the following para-
graphs of this section refer to labour engaged on a
civilian basis.
2. In engaging civilians for employment of a perma-
nent character A.B. 41 will be used. All necessary
details regarding the civilian, especially his personal
description, should be filled in on engagement, but the
officer by whom a civilian is paid will be held responsible
that his book is complete in every respect.
3. In the case of natives, a cardboard ticket with the
man's number, name, title, and the gang he belongs
to inscribed on it, may be substituted for A.B. 41.
Natives must wear in some conspicuous position a
metal disc with the initial letters of their unit or service,
and their identity number stamped on it. Coloured
badges, showing the branch of the service to which they
are attached, will also be worn.
