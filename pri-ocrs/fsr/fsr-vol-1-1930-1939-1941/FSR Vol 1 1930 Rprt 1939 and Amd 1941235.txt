the rear unless specifically ordered to do so. It may be
necessary to increase the number of stretcher-bearers
preparatory to an action in which a considerable number
of wounded is anticipated.
3. The regimental stretcher-bearers will be employed
in rendering first aid to the wounded and collecting and
carrying them, with their arms and equipment, to the
R.A.Ps. or as the advance progresses to safe cover
along the line of advance. Places at which wounded
are thus collected under cover will be indicated by
flags or other signs, which should be distributed to the
bearers before the action.
No regimental bearer will carry wounded further
back than the R.A.P.
4. At the R.A.P. attention is given to the wounded
by the medical establishment of the unit.
Wounded able to walk will be directed to make
their own way from the R.A.P. to the W.W.C.P. formed
by a portion of a field ambulance (see Sec. 116, 6).
Wounded unable to walk will be removed by the
stretcher-bearers of the field ambulance to the advanced
dressing station, either by hand carriage, wheeled
stretcher, or by horse or motor transport. If necessary
arrangements will be made by the A.G.'s branch to
provide additional bearers from units not engaged, and,
so long as there are wounded to be carried, every batch
