[Chap. IV, Sec. 18.
The work of the general staff cannot be efficiently
carried out without the intimate co-operation of these
three sections. The intelligence section must convey
immediately to the operations section all information
received, so that no opportunity may be lost of turning it
to account, and to the staff duties section to ensure early
and timely action by the other branches. The opera-
tions section must keep both intelligence and staff
duties sections constantly informed of the commander's
intentions so that there may be no waste of energy
or time in the work of those two sections by reason of
misdirection of effort. Equally the statt duties section
must keep the operations and intelligence sections fully
aware at all times of the requirements of the other
branches by keeping in constant touch with the latter,
so that no plans may be contemplated which would tax
administrative arrangements beyond the limit of safety.
The general staft at G.H.e. will include officers specially
charged with duties connected with artillery, engineers,*
and tanks.
7. While the work of the general staff falls naturally
* General staff duties in connection with engineers will be as
follows :
(a) Organization of engineer units and the distribution of
engineer units to formations, &c.
(6) Forecasts of engineer work.
(c) Requisitioning on the intelligence staff for engineer
information required ; consideration and dissemination
of such information (Sec. 20, 1, 1):
(d) Collection,
collation and dissemination of engineer
information within the zone of the forces.
(e) Co-ordination of engineer work in formations and policy
of allocation of engineer stores.
(f) Engineer schools and training.
