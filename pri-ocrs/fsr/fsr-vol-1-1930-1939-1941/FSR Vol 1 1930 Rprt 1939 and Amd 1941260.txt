sanitary sites, as near good roads as is com-
patible with safety from attacks from the air

places which the enemy would be likely to
attack from the air or by long-range gun fire.
v. Staff and signal offices will adjoin each other and
be clearly marked.
vi. Officers must be close to their men.
vii. Horse lines must be so situated that horses do
not have to use or cross traffic routes to go to
water.
viti. Dismounted units carrying out continuous
marches and halted for the night will be
billeted as close as possible to the line of
march for the next day.
ix. Tanks, armoured cars and other mechanical
vehicles must be disposed so as to leave main
roads clear.
