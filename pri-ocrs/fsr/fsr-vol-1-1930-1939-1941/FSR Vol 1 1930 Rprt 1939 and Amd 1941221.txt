[Chap. XV, Sec. 112.
112. General organization of the medical service for
evacuation
1. The medical service in the field is organized to
ensure rapid evacuation of sick and wounded, including
prisoners of war. The efficiency with which this system
is organized and administered greatly affects the mobility
and morale of the army.
2. The medical service will deal with the discipline,
pay, clothing, feeding and disposal of all sick and
wounded from the time they come under medical care
until they are discharged to duty.
3. The medical organization is theoretically based on
a system of three zones, namely :â€”
i. The collecting zone :-
(a) The medical establishment of units.
(b) Field ambulances (including cavalry field
ambulances).
(c) Motor ambulance convoys.
11. The evacuating zone :-
(a) Casualty clearing stations.
(b) Motor ambulance convoys.
(c) Ambulance trains.
(d) Ambulance aeroplanes.
iti. The distributing zone :-
(a) General hospitals.
(b) Convalescent depots.
(c) Hospital carriers, hospital ships and ambu-
lance transports.
(d) Military hospitals outside the theatre of
operations.
(e) Ambulance car companies (R.A.S.C.).
