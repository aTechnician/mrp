Chap. I, Sec. 2.]

3. The object to be attained in the organization of
the Army for war is to place in the hands of the C.-in-C.
a machine so co-ordinated down to its smallest units
and so controlled by its various subordinate commanders
and their staffs, as to make it possible for the C.-in-C.
readily and constantly to apply the principles of war
(Sec. 8, Vol. II, 1929), in accordance with the ever-
changing demands of a campaign.
4. War organization must, therefore, ensure elasticity,
unity of effort, decentralization of control, and economy.
Elasticity-to enable the machine to adjust itself
quickly and smoothly to the stresses and strains thrown
upon it by varying and unforeseen circumstances.
Unity of effort in order that all available resources
may be directed solely towards the attainment of the
common object.
Decentralization of control-to a strictly limited
number of subordinates in order that authority may be
delegated without overlapping and that such delegation
may result in co-ordinated action and the assumption
of a proper share of responsibility by subordinate
commanders.
Economyâ€”in order that the best use may be made of
the man power available by reserving the higher
category men, as far as possible, for duties in direct
contact with the enemy, which require physical fitness
and a high standard of military training and discipline,
personnel of a lower category or civilians being allotted
duties requiring a less degree of physical fitness and
military training.
