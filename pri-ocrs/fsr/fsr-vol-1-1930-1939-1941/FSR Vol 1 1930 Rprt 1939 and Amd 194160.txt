execute a plan, and of any special difficulties
anticipated.
4. On the march, or in action, the senior general
staff officer, with at least one assistant, will usually
be with the commander. In the case of large formations,
the senior assistant should be of sufficient standing
to represent the senior general staff officer should the
latter be required temporarily to leave headquarters.
5. The work of the general staff branch given under
para. 1, above, consists broadly of three main
categories :â€”
i. Plans: their initiation, subject to the com-
mander's orders, and the drafting and issue of
all orders and instructions necessary to put
them into execution.
ii. Information: obtaining all the data required
to enable a plan to be initiated
iii. War organization, training and liaison.
6. The general staff is therefore organized in three
sections :
i. The operations section.
ii. The intelligence section.
iii. The staff duties and training section.
