114. Regimental aid post
1. Commanding officers of units will arrange, in
conjunction with the unit medical officers, for the
selection and notification to all ranks of a locality at
which the first treatment for the wounded during an
action may be administered by medical officers. This
locality is named the regimental aid post (R.A.P.).
2. The principles guiding the selection of the position
and movements of a R.A.P. in varying tactical situations
are dealt with in R.A.M.C. Training. The R.A.P.
should be so situated that the medical officer may be
able to keep in touch with the situation during opera-
tions through unit headquarters.
3. A R.A.P. will remain in its original site until, by
reason of the movement of units, it is no longer able
to carry out its functions efficiently. It is not advisable
to change the location of a R.A.P. during an action
more frequently than is necessary. When its position
is changed notification will be sent at once to the officer
commanding the bearers of the field ambulance collecting
the wounded.
4. Officers commanding units will give full considera-
tion to the requirements of the R.A.P. in the allotment
of available cover such as dug-outs, machine-gun
emplacements, bomb-proof shelters, cellars, &c., on
captured ground.
