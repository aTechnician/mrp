[Chap. XIV, Sec. 97.
If evacuated as in (i) above the casualty vehicle will
be accompanied by its driver, who will take over the
replacement vehicle from the vehicle reception depot and
return with it to his unit.
If evacuated as in (ii) the vehicle reception depot will
despatch the replacement vehicle to the unit concerned
in charge of a convoying driver.
Under both (i) and (ii), the authority for the issue of
a replacement vehicle will be the D.S.T., to whom
indents for replacement vehicles will be submitted by
units through the representative of the D.S.T. at forma-
tion headquarters.
The vehicle reception depot, R.A.S.C., is organized
for the receipt, custody and issue of replacement vehicles ;
and the receipt and disposal of evacuated vehicles.
The depot will be so located as to facilitate the receipt
and evacuation of casualty vehicles and the speedy
receipt by units of replacement vehicles. Circumstances
may necessitate a detachment of this depot being located
in an advanced position.
2. Mechanical vehicles for the maintenance of which the
R.A.O.C. is responsible (i.e., those vehicles not belonging
to R.A.S.C. units or driven by R.A.S.C. personnel).—
Mechanical vehicles requiring L. of C. repairs which can
proceed under their own power or are capable of being
towed will normally be evacuated either to :—
i. The formation supply railhead, or
ii. The advanced ordnance depot, if established,
as may be ordered. Those which cannot be dealt with
as indicated above will be taken over by " Recovery
sections" working from the advanced base or railhead
as may be found expedient.
