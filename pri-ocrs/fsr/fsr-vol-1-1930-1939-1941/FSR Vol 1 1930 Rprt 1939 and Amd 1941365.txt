[Appendix II.
4. It will thus be seen that the graph shows the three
factors in time and space calculations, viz.:â€”
(a) Timing at a starting point.
(b) Timing at any subsequent point.
(c) Rate of march.
If a graph is constructed with any two of these as data,
the third can be read off.
If, for example, the head of a column moving at 3
miles an hour is to reach R, 6 miles from O, at 0200
hours, the hour of start is found by drawing from R
towards the starting point, the line RQ at the slope
representing 3 miles an hour and producing it until
it cuts the horizontal line representing the starting
point O.

minutes immediately preceding each clock hour. Move-
ment ceases at 0050 hours and is resumed at 0100 hours.
