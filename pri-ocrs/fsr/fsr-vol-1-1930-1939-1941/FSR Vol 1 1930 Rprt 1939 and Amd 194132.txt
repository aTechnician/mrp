or wholly among corps, and, if necessary, to meet a
particular situation, corps commanders may place
temporarily any non-divisional unit under divisional
commanders. Non-divisional units not allotted in this
manner to subordinate formations remain under the
direct control of the commander retaining them, and
are termed G.H.Q. troops, army troops and corps troops
as the case may be. In all cases the commander who
makes an allotment of non-divisional units will be
responsible for the provision of the appropriate units
of the services to ensure proper maintenance.

position, but will be composed of such formations and
units as the situation for the time being may demand.
In the interests of efficiency it is important that their
composition should be changed as seldom as possible.

in war establishments, or in war equipment tables, will
