Loading point and unloading point should be chosen to
ensure this, except in extreme emergency and for very
limited periods.
When the normal system of forward supply is in force,
the distance between railhead and delivery point may

stances to less than 50 miles when conditions are adverse,
or traffic is abnormally congested.
Accurate timing of marches reduces the strain upon
personnel.
105. Movement and distribution of material in advance
of railhead
1. Material for the daily requirements of troops arrives
at railhead by pack train (see Sec. 93, 4) loaded

a section number. The section number is allotted to
a formation on its arrival in the theatre of war and is
utilized throughout the chain of supply as far as railheads

2. Material is drawn at railhead from pack trains
by third line transport by sections as loaded. Second
