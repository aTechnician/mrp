essential that for any task the officer in charge of the
work should ensure that :
i. The preliminary estimate of time and labour has
been accurately calculated.
ii. The necessary tools and materials are avail-
able at the site at the time the work is to begin.
A preliminary conference if possible should always
be held on the site between the officer in charge of the
work and the officer commanding the labour party,
so that the latter may thoroughly understand what is
required and can distribute his men, as they arrive, to
the best advantage and with a minimum of delay.
72. Hirings service
1. The hirings service is responsible for the purchase,
requisition, and hire of billets, training grounds,
buildings and lands, and for the regulation of all claims
made in connection therewith, except such as may be
dealt with by a claims commission, if one is established.
2. The head of the service will be the Director of
Hirings (D. Hgs.). He will be represented at army
headquarters and headquarters of L. of C. areas.
3. The personnel of the service will be provided by
officers of any arm appointed to the service, by reason
of special qualifications, and the service will be organized
in offices, distributed throughout the theatre of war on
a territorial basis.
4. When the scale of operations does not justify the
separate establishment of a hiring service the duties of
the hirings service will be carried out by the works
service (Sec. 80).
