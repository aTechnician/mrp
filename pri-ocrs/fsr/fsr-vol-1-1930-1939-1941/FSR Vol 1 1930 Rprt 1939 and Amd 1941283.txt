[Chap. XVI, Sec. 159.
A sketch plan showing the lay-out of the camp should
be prepared and a copy given to the officer responsible
for pitching the camp. Tents, at the required intervals
and distances, should be dressed both from the front and
flank; main and cross streets should be maintained for
the purpose of communication.
2. A system of surface drainage should be constructed.
3. Care should be taken to prevent the pollution by
latrines, urinals or refuse pits of ground within 100 yards
of the encampment or any possible extension of it. An
improvised pail system of removal should be established
if possible, otherwise latrine trenches at least six feet
deep must be dug. Pails and benches should be fly
proof.
4. Incinerators for burning dead animals, refuse, &c.,
should be constructed. Horse and cattle lines should
be cleaned regularly, manure removed, and special
precautions taken to prevent ground in the neighbour-
hood of kitchens and washing places becoming fouled.
Flies are a source of disease and care is necessary to
prevent them from breeding in horse dung, dirt and
refuse and from coming into contact with food. Ifit has
not been possible to construct incinerators dead animals
should be buried as far away as possible, and the spots
marked.
5. Notice boards should be erected showing the posi-
tion of offices, depots, hospitals, veterinary hospitals,
watering places, latrines, urinals, refuse pits, &c.,
and a plan of the camp should be on view at the com-
mandant's office. All parties, on arrival, should have
the arrangements, including those for defence when
