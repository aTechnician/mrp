[Chap. XI, Secs. 58 and 59.
6. The signal unit of a formation is responsible for
effecting first line repairs to signalling instruments held
by all units of that formation.
Stores sent to signal
units for repair will be accompanied by an indent which
will be passed by the O.C. signal unit to the D.A.D.O.S.
of the formation when the instrument is not capable of
repair or cannot be replaced by the signal unit.
59. Regulation of the supply of material in the field
1. Certain categories of material are required for issue
in considerable quantities to area parks and in smaller
quantities to maintain unit equipment, or for other
purposes within unit organizations.
In such cases the service responsible for provision will
arrange for consignments to a theatre of operations to
be made direct to the base depot of the user service.
The user service will be responsible for giving estimates
of requirements to the providing service.
PROVISION
2. It must be realized that the demands of an army
in the field for stores of new design in any considerable
quantity, or even for stores of commercial pattern in
quantities which considerably exceed the normal
consumption in time of peace, disturb the complex and
delicately balanced organization of the industrial system.
Adjustments to this organization are necessarily slow
to achieve the desired results.
Therefore, in order that a sufficiency of every class of
stores may exist in the theatre of war for issue when
required by the troops, heads of services of the army in
the field must receive early information of the intention
