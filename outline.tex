% Conops, perhaps use a narrative flow moving from before invasion for the
% prepwork and training, to the actual invasion for execution and adaptation,
% to transition around or after TOTALIZE?

% TLDR:  if you accept that the British CA soldier was tactically worse than
% teh Germans but were able to defeat the Gemrans by unloading an ungodly
% amout of steel and expolosives over their head at the first sign of 
% difficulty, then the british logistial soldier was far superior.  A war 
% cannot be won by killing alone!

% CONOPS:  What if I do this as a microhistory of 90 Coy?  I can use them as 
% a way to talk about the criticallity of logistics.  What if I used them as
% the pivot around which an army (tbh, 27 Armd Bde, and 3 Div) can turn?  I 
% can use it to skirt around the wider issue that I don't have evidecne for
% a macro view but I have 90 Coys WD.  Alas, I can't find as many decorations
% for them as I would like to really make it personal.  Could I use examples 
% from other units as a `take Cpl Bloggins from X, note the work he did'?
% time to run git branch I suppose.  It also allows me to be narrative which
% is always fun.  Their 4 day history was already 7 pages, I could breath life
% into.  I can harp on about them for 8-10 x that, right? 1-2 pages 
% intoducing (let's do it as if they hit a beach and they're driving a 
% convoy up the road to Benouville with that preload of supplies for 6 Airborn
% whence we pause to discuss what we currently talk about in the 
% historiography.   I have 5-10 pages on what other people have been writing 
% about Normandy, from there, perhaps another 5ish to narrow down on Sword 
% Beach, the whys, the objectives, who was involved etc. --- I shoudl re-read
% return of martin guerre I think.  

	% so 20pgs here, I'll probably do more once I footnote it all.
% With this context, we return to the convoy and lay out the theretical 
% framework by which logistics operates.  Depots, lengths of supply lines,
% how distribution happens, etc.  How this work integrates with the rest of
% the army.  We deliver the supplies and talk about the RV.  Let's also start
% talking about the arduous work over the next few days to supply 3 Div and 
% 27th bde as there are no other 2nd line transport units.  As we continue 
% here, I can interesect the sources for 27th Armoured Bde to give context
% as to what 90 Coy was doing.  I suppose I"ll have to do soem probablies and
% perhapses.  We can talk about how 90 Coy supported the Bde until the Bde was
% disbanded.  Then, continue talking about how the Coy supported other units
% till Totalize maybe?  Then, have a final almost pre-conclusion discussing
		% Perhaps this takes 4-6 pagesish?
% how, whilst we don't write about it, these oprations would have been 
% impossible without the supporting arms and concluding with how the British
% ability to have tacitical mediocraty and an unwillingness to spend lives
% meant that their logistics had to be good, really good.  Mmbe this would 
% work? 

\section{Introduction}

	%Estimate 2-3 pgs?

	% Set scene, we're in Normandy, 6 [time] Jun 44, we just landed, we're
	% driving from Queen Beach to Benouville to link up with 6 Abrn.  
	% you're X lorries are carrying preloads of ammunition, rations, and
	% other supplies for 6 Abrn.  They're holding the Anglo-American 
	% left flank from a possible German counter attack.  what if I put
	% it in the perspective of that Lt who did the initial recce?  YOu 
	% weren't originally scheduled to land yet but an accdient of war
	% means here you are.  Describe more about what 6 Airborne is doing
	% you don't belong to 6 Airborn but are instead of 27 bde, you're 
	% just taksed to help them on D day, their unit 2nd line unit will
	% arrive from Juno later /* Come back to this when discussing import */

	% THESIS
	% You know what you're doing is important, without these supplies and 
	% the war will ground to a halt.  

	% You wonder what the historians who write about these events 80 years 
	% in the future will think about it all, what drives your focus?

	% Maybe have a bitter reflection, it's always teh fighting troops or
	% the generals who get the cheers.  No-one appauds the cooks!  Use
	% the perhapses of history for this

	% Segue to historiographical review?

\section{Historiographical Review}

	% `Of course we know that 80 years after the fact, historians...'

	% Complain loudly and long-windedly at the lack of discussion on log 
	% in /*insert list */  Consider subsections or flow of text?

	% Discuss the current logistical scholarship done
		% Namely historical work in 50s and Supplying War, Julian
		% Thompson, Great Feat...

	% Introduce Section

	% General observations:
		% Much work done on great men, tactics, the merits of German
		% Armour; and some work has been done on American logistics,
		% as well as logistical peculiarities like the mulberry 
		% harbours.  I fear little has been done on the actual
		% military administration of the war.  Indeed, the logistical
		% section of military history is fairly poorly written about
		% by hisotrians, some more work done military acadamies
		% reflecting its importance to them
	\subsection{On WW2} % there's got to be a better name than this
		\subsubsection{\textit{Britian's Other Army:  The Story of
			the ATS}}
			% This feels kinda awkward to put here
		\subsubsection{\textit{Why the Allies Won}}

	\subsection{On Normandy}
% reorder this, chrono flow or based on argument?

% really flesh out the common critiques and defences of the British Army, 
% that it was slow to develop, under manned, unimaginative, morale problems,
% materiel over lives

		\subsubsection{\textit{Clash of Arms}}
			% Argues that the British were slow and failed in

	\subsection{On Logistics}
% reorder this

%% Do I wanna put the books for WW2 logistics here or in WW2?  I'm tempted
% to concentrate it here but I also like the idea of keeping something from
% the field of military science and not history seperate --- military science
% cares much more on actually executing operations.  Split this into two 
% subsubs and make the rest subsubsubs?  One for hisotry, one for less so?
% Could also compress, maybe compressing and not sectioning this section 
% will flow better.  In any case, I wonder if it's better to chk pg ct

		\subsubsection{\textit{Supplying War:  Logistics from
			Wallenstine to Patton}}
			% Foundational in logistics scholarship, but, given
			% it's broad scope, it lacks depth
		\subsubsection{\textit{The Lifeblood of War: Logistics in

	\subsection{Tools of the Trade} % maybe rename this

	% The historiographical Gap.  Introduce an inattentiveness to log
	% here, that the materiel advantage is contingent on getting this
	% right.
	
	\subsection{A Note on My Sources}
		
		% Heavy reliance on digital records

		% paper records from Canadian sources owing to funding but
		% argue for the soundness of the methodology anyways given
		% how Canadian stuff is of Br doctrine

% Start with Context %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{WTF are we doing here!?} % rename this

	% We return to our convoy, you're thinking and a bit day-dreamy 
	% driving through the French countryside thinking about the 
	% magnitude of what you're acutally doing.  DO I want to go this
	% tone??

	% Overlord & Neptune:  Mission, invade France, push the Germans
	% across the rhine sooner or later

	% Division of beaches, start from the W and move E.  How beaches
	% are subdivided.  Start thinking about the beach exits maybe and
	% why they matter?  Maybe reflect on the massive traffic jams?

	% Talk about the 'bloody army', Q branch, A branch, and G branch.

\section{} % move to Hermanville, 90 coy's control point in running convoys

	% Talk about how supply works, the DIDs, supply lines, POL differences

	% complaint about the flimsies and containerized fuel

	% talk about how you sustain client units, march length, the end goal
	% of ending the day with filled tanks, full ammo, etc.

	% Keep that story telling feeling, you're at the control point mourning
	% the fact that there are no other second line units, you're vastly 
	% overworked.  If only you had the additional units to support you.
	% if only ____ instead, you're left trying to maintins [sustainment
	% standards] and just keep what's needed flowing as hard as you can.

	{Logistics Working Practices in Theory}

	% Use to establish what we're actually dealing with so importance
	% becomes self-evident
	
	% How supply chains work from dumps, and depots, to distribution, to
	% 1st line units.  

	% ``The principle of supply is that field units should always have
	% with them, or within reach, two days' rations and forage, and one 
	% iron ration, and that these stocks should be replenished by 
	% delivery, at a point within reach of the troops, of one day's ration
	% and forage each day.'' %cite No27 Trg Course p. 32, quoted in,
	% refs F.S.R. Vol. I. Sec107(I). %validate this

	% Key was placed on  on rabild concentration of force, incl sup, LofC
	% etc. to permit strategic use of force %cite 27 trg crs p. 32

	\subsection{The Structure of Supply}
		
		% 4 main areas, the BSA, L of C, Corps/GHQ area, Div area
		% goes from 

		%cite No 27 Trg Course p. 34ish (diagram's on 34)
		\subsubsection{The Base Supply-Area (BSA)}
			% The Docks
				% Bulk Petorl
				% Cold STorage

			% Main Supply Depot --- Field Bakery, DID

			% Petorl Sub Depot 

			% Base Marhsalling Yard (start of railway line)

		\subsubsection{L of C Area}

			% Einvisioned as a railway line, lorries will do 
			% just fine but this theory came at the dawn of
			% mechanization.  Point was to take stores from
			% the BSA and transport them near the combat zone.
			% It's basically a transprot area.  IT goes from 
			% just outside the BSA to, and including the railhead.

			% If distance from the BSA to the railhead is < 12
			% hr trip, BSA will control.  Else, there will be
			% a regulating station around 6 hrs from the rail
			% head. %cite no27 Winter Trg p. 32 5c
			
			% The railheads also had field supply depots, to
			% supply local resources.
			
			% If using trucks, it's 150 tons per 21 trucks with
			% old pat, 59 tonns across 12 trucks (5 supplies, 2 
			% ord, 2 R E, 2 stores, 1 RAMC)  railway trucks 
			% %cite No 27 course, p. 32 para 5

		\subsubsection{Corps or GHQ Area}

			% Start of what really starts to feel like the
			% field army and not just transport areas.
			% Transprt at thsi point is by road.

			% Seperate Chain for 'stuff' and POL.  POL is the
			% Coprs Petrol Park (25 Mi for Div, 75 mi for C.T)
			% Explain the logic of this.  POL used containerized
			% distribution rather than tankers for end-point
			% distriubtion.  Used flimsies or jerrycans

			% Supply Coln. HQ handles the rest of it.  Here, 
			% stores are bulk broken and sent further forward.

		\subsubsection{Div Area}
			
			% POL side, POL is held at the Div Petrol Coy 
			% and should have a 50 mi. supply (chk this).  
			% The div Pet Coy will set up petrol points and
			% unit transport will collect POL from those points.

			% General Supplies are handled at a rondezvous 
			% where supplies will be delivered at delivery 
			% points via meeting points.  Range from the L of C
			% area to the DPs is 30-40 mi.  DPs are where 
			% individual units come to collect stores.
	

	\subsection{Warehousing}

		% Especially in those early weeks when a lot of it was dumping
		% rather than warehousing per-se.  

		% DID (maybe??) 3000 Tons/acre= gross stacking area.  x 4-10
		% for expansion %cite No 27 trg 32 (this might be a general
		% rule too)

		\subsubsection{Base Supply Depots}
			% Located near Base Marshalling Yard, outside docks
			% to permit expansion and dispersion.  Consider `water
			% light, telephones, good roads, office accomodation'
			% when selecting the location. Area = Strength X 
			% stock X weight one ration / (unintelligable) = 
			% 8.5 sq ft /ton = stacking 
			% +50\% for stock spacing = gross stacking area X 4
			% to 10 for expansion, etc.  (that's a quote)
			%cite 27 trg course p.32, 4
	% zoom out a little and talk about what you'll be controlling.

/* Figure out where to incorporate the fact that the British/Canadians focused
on firepower over manpower.  This means materiel is critical --- A is for ammo,
B is for beans, C cold water, D: deisil, E-everything else... */

/* Do I want to expand to include things like traffic control?  Traffic jams
on Sword Beach may have made the Br fail to capture Caen on D.  10m of dry
beach between water and sea wall at high tide.  Perhaps an MP or two would
have solved the issue. IIRC, RAF beach sqn dealt with it. (See
RAF beach sqn/det  Was this a critcal
oversight?  Not a lack of tenacity or anything else, but a good, old fasioned
traffic jam vis-a-vis Toronto at rush-hour caused the failure to take Caen?
lol --- what a way to win a war! */


	\subsection{Distribution and Transport}
		% Intermixing of the RASC and RAOC for moving the 'stuff' vs
		% transporting the 'stuff'

		% 'Harbours', how increadably quaint lol!

		% Discuss the role of MPs, you can't have supply without 
		% transport, and you can't have transport without a traffic 
		% light (MP)

	\subsection{Delivery} 
		% this may be rather light.  IDK if sources avail for action 
		% line unit's distr.  One feels they tend to assume the stuff 
		% just arrives, then hands it out.

	% where to talk about POL?  %cite No 27 trg course p. 35

\section{Maybe add a section on how log is taken foregranted?}
% Maybe make this a subsection?  I wonder if I can find any examples though.

% Water, food, etc. have very few mention in the sources.  Some discussion
% made in AGFOI.  

% Discuss the hard requriements (meals/day, water rations 
% (this is in many OpsOs) 

	% Find in RCASC trg docs, it's somewhere there --- perhaps when my
	% eyes stop flashing!

% Maybe discuss why it's important it doesnt fail?  I'm hungry, dehydrated,
% out of ammo, and freezing, what good am I?

	% Just how much evidence do i need?  So much of this is pointing
	% out the obvious, but, at the same time, unless you've been outside
	% hungry and shivering, I wonder if you realize just how miserable
	% it is.

% the British fondness for artillary is quite useless without ammo --- a 
% 25-pdr isn't even a good paperweight, it'll only crush the paper!

	% Find rounds per hour, rounds per lorry, etc.  See if I can find 
	% surface area requriements for dumps to avoid a rapid incineration
	% of the dump when subjected to enemy fire.

\section{Failures and Successes}

% there's 90 coy RASC on D - D+3ish

% Coy maintained the 6th airborn bridgehead as well as the 3rd Br Infantry 
% Div and 27 Armd Brig for multiple days on Overlord.  They ferried 
% and arranged all transport on the D Day off Sword beach.  No other 2nd line
% unit avail.

% but I wonder if this merits a whole section. 

	% Only 2nd line RASC unit to land on d-day.  Supported 6 Airborn & 27
	% armd bde

	% planned was that 27th would be supported by by 3 div for POL.  Due
	% to extra shipping space, 1 platoon of 90 coy was to land with the
	% 105 amn for 3 div, amn, mines, POL, water, RE stores for 6 para 
	% (abv is quoteish)  Last minute, more space became avail, 13 3-tons
	% landed D-day 1st tide to support 27th with POL.  THey became first
	% to land at 1300.  POL would have been in tins and not bulk. 
	% POL, water, RE stores for 6 airborne.  Original lorries from 3div
	% with 27th's POL didn't arrive till D+2, tanks aren't useful without
	% POL.  13 lorries of B Pl thus supplied the whole bde. Check support
	% range in RASC traning docs.  Virtually no breaks until D+4 C pl 
	% did 6 airborne.  6 Airborne started resupply at 2300, returned to
	% harbour by 0430

	% Veh capacity 11 on D, 33 D+1, 23 D + 2, 20 by D + 4.  Decline due
	% to casualties.  Transprted 5-6 lorries to carry 3rd Br Inf Div 
	% re-inforcements, sups for 27 Armd Bde (quoteish) Experience useful
	% as 6th Abrn supply pers were unable to communicate requirements
	% or forecast them accurately.  As such, veh moved constantly between
	% the beach and 6th airborne.  Beach congestion very heavy.  
	% transport so short that no trip could be wasted.  Lorry drivers 
	% even were used as a quazi recce to ensure they always knew what
	% would be needed.  This was reported to Pl Harbour as they passed.

	% Trip from Coy Haroubr to beach and back was a 2 hr trip.  
	%cite Jul hist rep sheet 5

	% As it happens, 6 para supplies landed at Juno and were stuck till
	% D + 4.  

	% Harbour planned for W of Hermanville not secured till d+2, 
	% temp harbour E of Colleville 2-3 mi from enemy pos.  
	%cite june-history-report.pdf(4)

	% Chk pg ct, perhaps elaborate, perhaps not.

	%cite sourcery/wd/27armd/90coy/06/histrep p1

% Maybe traffic control and overlord fire control too?  Shoudl I divide into
% supply and transport?  

	% If this, what about MPs directing traffic under fire --- sounds
	% rediculous when you put it like that but it was certainly done.

	% Include ambulance drivers?  It feels a little too otuside the remit
	% though

\section{Transition to Future Ops} % Consider omission after Sep 44?  
% maybe swrod beach

% could I perhaps use some records from medal citations for this?
