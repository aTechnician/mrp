% Conops, perhaps use a narrative flow moving from before invasion for the
% prep work and training, to the actual invasion for execution and adaptation,
% to transition around or after TOTALIZE?

% TLDR:  if you accept that the British CA soldier was tactically worse than
% the Germans but were able to defeat the Germans by unloading an ungodly
% amount of steel and explosives over their head at the first sign of 
% difficulty, then the British logistical soldier was far superior.  A war 
% cannot be won by killing alone!

% Thesis: 

% L1:  Historical community is quite hard on the British for lacklustre
% results vis-a-vis armoured warfare and armour-infantry co-operation; 
% however, what this is missing is that the British Army --- Army, not 
% economy --- work quite well at a logistical level.  This is what, in the
% field, enabled the British Army to defeat the Germans despite tactical
% mediocrity.  Logistics worked to support flawed tactics.

% L2:  Criticality of the services to the effective waging of war.

% L3:  We ought to stop viewing armies as mere fighting forces.  Understanding
% them using a systems approach explains why we can win wars.  Merely 
% examining how an army can outfight its opponent at a tactical level misses
% the operational reasons the tactical level can even function.


% CONOPS:  What if I do this as a microhistory of 90 Coy?  I can use them as 
% a way to talk about the criticality of logistics.  What if I used them as
% the pivot around which an army (tbh, 27 Armd Bde, and 3 Div) can turn?  I 
% can use it to skirt around the wider issue that I don't have evidence for
% a macro view but I have 90 Coy's WD.  Alas, I can't find as many decorations
% for them as I would like to really make it personal.  Could I use examples 
% from other units as a `take Cpl Bloggins from X, note the work he did'?
% time to run git branch I suppose.  It also allows me to be narrative which
% is always fun.  Their 4 day history was already 7 pages, I could breath life
% into.  I can harp on about them for 8-10 x that, right? 1-2 pages 

% introducing (let's do it as if they hit a beach and they're driving a 
% convoy up the road to Benouville with that preload of supplies for 6 Airborne
% whence we pause to discuss what we currently talk about in the 
% historiography.   I have 5-10 pages on what other people have been writing 
% about Normandy, from there, perhaps another 5ish to narrow down on Sword 
% Beach, the whys, the objectives, who was involved etc. --- I should re-read
% return of martin guerre I think.  

	% so 20-30pgs here, I'll probably do more once I footnote it all.
% With this context, we return to the convoy and lay out the theoretical 
% framework by which logistics operates.  Depots, lengths of supply lines,
% how distribution happens, etc.  How this work integrates with the rest of
% the army.  We deliver the supplies and talk about the RV.  Let's also start
% talking about the arduous work over the next few days to supply 3 Div and 
% 27th Bde as there are no other 2nd line transport units.  As we continue 
% here, I can intersect the sources for 27th Armoured Bde to give context
% as to what 90 Coy was doing.  I suppose I"ll have to do some probables and
% perhapses.  We can talk about how 90 Coy supported the Bde until the Bde was
% disbanded.  Then, continue talking about how the Coy supported other units
% till Totalize maybe?  Then, have a final almost pre-conclusion discussing
		% Perhaps this takes 4-6 pages-ish?
% how, whilst we don't write about it, these operations would have been 
% impossible without the supporting arms and concluding with how the British
% ability to have tactical mediocrity and an unwillingness to spend lives
% meant that their logistics had to be good, really good.  

% Expand this to how armies function, and who this paper doesn't cover.  I 
% don't discuss workshops, clerks --- the whole of A branch actually --- MPs, 
% BADs, beach detachments, etc. yet they're all important. (5 pgs)  Maybe 
% paint a picture of the whole rear area and why it's important (landing

	% just tasked to help them on D day, their unit 2nd line unit will
	% arrive from Juno later /* Come back to this when discussing import */

It's 1630 hrs on 6 June 1944, Captain Foreman just arrived at his company 
harbour near Colleville.  An hour earlier, he and the 11 lorries of C Platoon
90 Company RASC (90 Coy) disembarked the LSTs they had been stuck on for the 
past six days waiting to cross the English Channel to support Operation 
Overlord, the Anglo-American invasion of Normandy 
France.\autocite[1--6 June 1944]{90wd}  Loaded in these 
11 lorries are supplies for 6 Airborne Division currently operating to secure 
the British left flank over the Orne.  These loads consist of `pet[rol], 
[ammunition], R[oyal] E[ngineer] stores, and water', stores vital for the 
paras of 6 Airborne Division to resist a German counter 
attack.\autocite[S \& T Report (June History Report) p 4]{90wd} 
%cite check this later
Alas, despite the urgency of these stores, Major Cuthbertson, 90 Company's 
Officer Commanding has yet to make contact with 6 Airborne so C Platoon has 
little to do but wait for contact to be 
established.\autocite[6 June 1944]{90wd}
Thus, doubtless, the men of C Platoon, 90 Coy would have dismounted their 
lorries and pause.  Likely, they would have apprieciated being once more
on dry land having spent the last few days being bounced up and down in the
English Channel.  A few kilometres away, the men of the 6th Airborne Division,
the 3rd British Infantry Division, and 90 Coy's home brigade, 27th Armoured
Brigade were, in the case of 6th Airborne, guarding the British flank, or
in the case of 3 Div and 27 Armoured Bde, pushing inland to try to reach
Caen.

	% THESIS
	% You know what you're doing is important, without these supplies and 
	% the war will ground to a halt.  

	% You wonder what the historians who write about these events 80 years 
	% in the future will think about it all, what drives your focus?

	% Maybe have a bitter reflection, it's always the fighting troops or
	% the generals who get the cheers.  No-one applauds the cooks!  Use
	% the perhapses of history for this

	% Shift to that historiographical frame:  With the benefit of 
	% hindsight, we know that the drive to Caen would not be a quick 
	% drive, but as a logistician, one asks oneself, was there a 
	% significant logistical constraint or was it due to something
	% else?

%e reword the this a little to emphisize my thesis in the context of expending
% material / men
Of course, the vital efforts of the 6th Airborne Division and the other 
fighting troops of the British Army in Normandy have been fairly well studied.
Extensive critiques and justifications have been made on British 
infantry-armour co-operation, the agression --- or lack thereof --- displayed
by British troops, Allied inadequacies in armour, Montgomery's personnality,
tactics, vs firepower, etc.  In short, we often discuss what went wrong or 
how we faught; however, what we often ignore is the critical question of what
enabled us to fight. The work done by troops a few kilometers behind the front 
line is generally ignored as a side-show; yet, the work of ensuring the combat 
arms are well supplied with all the minutiae of war from ammunition, to food, 
to water, and other general supplies is what will make or break an army. Thus,
in light of this gap, I hope to aruge for the centrality of logistics in the
British preference to expend firepower rather than lives.  The British Army
seems quite helpless compaired to the might of the Wehrmacht until one looks
at this Army from a systems approach.  It is however, this systems approach
that reveals the British Army's strengths.  %e I hate this para!

% add section on structure of argument --- maybe later once I un-f that para
To examine the centrality of logistics in British Army operations, we will 
follow Major %something
and 90 Company RASC as they work their way across the English channel, landing
in Normandy and following them as the units they support attempt to capture the
city of Caen, and we will examine their role in the closure of the Falaise 
Pocket in August.  Along the way, we will first examine how the British Army 
structured logistics administratively, before joining 90 Coy as they support
the 27 Armourded Brigade as they partake in the Battle for Caen.  
After 27 Armoured Brigade is broken up at the end of July,
we will see how 90 Coy integrated into a larger and longer supply column as
they support infantry units through Normandy. Following this, we will have 
a breif discussion on historical methods and how they apply to military 
logistcs.  %e I also hate this para, later problem!

The Battle of Normandy is of course, a well studied topic.  Much has been
written on this battle from books on the Second World War at large to 
publications that focus squarely on operaitons and tactics in Normandy.
Curiosuly, there is also a second historiography which discusses logistics
at large; however, the precise area of military logistics in Normandy is
less well covered.

	% Talk about the 'bloody army', Q branch, A branch, and G branch.

Op Overlord was made up of a number of smaller operations.  The seaborne
landings were part of Op Neptune.  This was the operation that established a
50 km wide logistical beachhead in Normandy.  Neptune divided this section of
Normandy coastline into five discontinuous beaches.  The Allied right was 
achored by Utah beach on the Cointine peninsula and the Allied left was 
anchored by the River Orne and the Caen Canal at Sword beach.  Between
these flank beaches was Omaha, Gold, and Juno beach.  The Americans were 
responsible for Utah and Omaha, whilst Anglo-Canadian forces were responsible
for Gold, Juno, and Sword beaches.  Each beach was subdivided into a 2 -- 4
sub-beaches and assigned a letter from A to R.  This study will primarily 
concern itself with the affairs of the troops of the 3rd British Infantry 
Division and 27 Armoured Bde that landed at Sword beach, specifically, Queen 
beach.  

This study will also concern itself with the work done by 6th Airborne
Division as part of Op Tonga.  Their objective was to execute a series of
airborne landings East of the River Orne, Caen Cannal, and Sword Beach to 
secure the British left flank.  They were also to capture the only bridge 
crossing
these water features North of Caen along a road running between Benouvelle
and Ranville.  All this was to be done during the night before the forces of
Op Neptune landed.  For approximately six hours, the paras of 6th Airborne
would be cut off.  Once the British landed at Sword beach, they would push
inland, to Benouville, cross the bridges if they were still intact, and
reinforce and resupply 6th Airborne.  That is how the 11 lorries of C Platoon 
90 Coy finds itself waiting in Colleville, around 4km away from Benouville
waiting for their CO to link up with the Paras so that C Platoon could 
resupply 6th Airborne who would likely be running low on stores by this point.
C Pl would then keep the paras supplied via Queen Beach until 6th Airborne's 
RASC unit could take over on D + 1 after landing at Juno.\autocite[1]{90wdjun}

By 1800, C pl made contact with the Paras and, as the Paras had successfully
captured the Orne and Caen Canal bridges, C pl was able to replenish the 
depleating ammunition of 6th Airborne by 2300 hrs on D - Day --- a five hour
job.  As 6th Airborne's area of oeprations had yet to be fully secured, the
drivers of C pl faced sniper fire throughout the day.\autocite[6 June 1944]
{90wd}

Not all of 90 Coy landed on D - Day however, whilst A and D Pls stayed in the
UK to be brought across the channel on % date
B Pl landed on D - Day.  
Their tasking to simply support 27 Armd Bde primarily in terms
of their fuel requirements and to otherwise keep the Bde supplied.  Their 13
lorries were mainly loaded with fuel for the Bde's Sherman tanks.  Alas,
Due to the heavy shelling of Queen Beach however, only 9 lorries actually 
landed by 1200 hrs.  The lorries that landed proceeded to the 27 Armd Bde's 
A Echlon Area in Hermanville-Sur-Mer and would quickly be put to work keeping
the Bde supplied with fuel and ammunition.\autocite[6 June 1944]{90wd}
Hermanville, situated along the main road departing Queen Beach --- location
of the Beach Sector Stores --- rapidly became 90 Coy's control point where
viehicles would check in before proceeding to the beaches or to the units.

As a point of
curiosity, you may have noticed how B Pl was not preloaded with amunition.  
This was because the Bde brought their own ammunition ashore firstly with
the ammunition they carried in their tanks, but also with the ammunition 
they towed behind their tanks in \textit{Porpoise} sledges.\autocite[2--3]
{90wdjun}  These sledges
would be released shortly after the tanks made it ashore.  Collecting the
ammunition in these sledges also became one of B Pl's tasks in the first
hours of the invasion.%cite 

Perahps as a happy co-incidence, Neptune had failed to meet it's D Day 
objective of pushing all the way to Caen --- an optimistic goal anyway.%cite
This meant that supply lines were shorter than planned which doubtless 
decreased the stress on the 9 lorries of B Pl.  
It is difficult to understate how heavy the 
fighting was.  Indeed, there were many instances where tanks were replenished
with tanks still `in their forward positions'.\autocite[2]{90wdjun}
This single understrength platoon was trying to keep a whole brigade supplied.
Tasks which would ordinarily been reasonably simple tasks were now increadably
onerous.  Take for example the task of refueling and reammunitioning the tanks.
What should have been a simple task done at the end of each day to ensure the
Brigade was ready for the next day's operations became a night long ordeal 
requiring the initiative of the 9 lorrie drivers of B Pl who had to understand
the requirements of their client unit before returning to the beaches to try 
to obtain the critical stores required by their units.  It was paramount that
these drivers not only knew what was needed, but the priority of what was 
needed in the event that there were insufficient stores available to meet
an urgent order.  This way, lorries were always moving and stores were 
always flowing.  Fortunately, by nightfall on D - Day, a small Brigade supply
dump was beginning to form in Hermanville --- an act taht would logistics 
chains.  Even still, this put a great strain on the men who were
worked day and night until D + 4.\autocite[2]{90wdjun}


% insert a transition into how B Pl was running around from BAD to units via
% Hermanville
Thus was the dispositions 90 Coy on D-Day, two Pls would make their way ashore:
one to support their parent unit, 27th Armd Bde and one help the Division to
their left --- 6th Airborne --- until their own RASC unit could make it. Here,
one can begin to see the role of 2nd line transport companies such as 90 Coy.  
They form the final interface between the wider supply system and the fighting
units ---  it is these untis that \textit{deliver the goods} --- however, how
did these 90 Coy interface with the rest of Army?  
% mabybe rethink this transition


\section{The Supply Chain in the Field} 
% move to Hermanville, 90 Coy's control point in running convoys

Whilst admittedly, the supply system on D - Day did appear somewhat improvised
and ramshackle, there was good reason for this.  Because the British failed to
advance as far forward as planned, the supply dumps that were to be set up all
along Sword Beach failed to materialize in the same way as planned.  Still,
the logisticians of the British Army tried to beat a formal planned system
into an effective supply chain however much improvised.  It is worth recalling
that, even without additional planning, the British Army's baseline doctrine 
included a supply chain.  This was after all, an army that could expect to be
deployed to not just fight a large, European Army, but also fight small wars
across vast streches of the British Empire.  To do so, the British Army already
had an organic logistical capacity that Overlord adapted to its use.  
At it's core

\begin{quotation}
	 The principle of supply [in the British Army was] that field units 
	should always have
	 with them, or within reach, two days' rations and forage, and one 
	 iron ration, and that these stocks should be replenished by 
	 delivery, at a point within reach of the troops, of one day's ration
	 and forage each day. %cite No27 Trg Course p. 32, quoted in,
	% refs F.S.R. Vol. I. Sec107(I). %validate this
	
	% add remark on fuel range
\end{quotation}

Moreover, as the British Army was fully mechanized by the Second World War,
it was the aim that all viehicles would have full petrol tanks at the end of
each day. To enable operational mobility, 2nd line transport was also to have 
immediately available, an additional 50 miles of fuel; and 3rd line transport,
a further 25 miles instantly available for use.\autocite[\Petrol][s 3]
{27course}
Of course, it is unlikely that this exact fuel holding was available on 
D - Day;
however, this was the standard the British Army would have expected.  These
principles meant that, at any one point, the British Army was expected to be
able to advance independant of it's bases for slightly over 75 mi over the 
course of three days.  Thus, this formed it's maximum operating range.

Of course, it is suboptimal for an Army to operate for long without access to
its supply chain so, to support the Army, the supply chain was broken up into 
four main areas, ordered from furthest to nearest the front line, 
the Base Sub-Area(BSA), the Line of Communication Area (LoC), the Corps or 
GHQ Area, and finally, the Divisional Area.  Thoes depots that 90 Coy went to
along the beach?  Those were Beach Sub-Areas (BSA).  In the first days at 
Normandy, it appears that Beach and  Base Sub-Areas were treated as one and
the same.  Whatever the `B' stands for, BSAs functioned as the British Army's
initial interface between sea and land.  The BSA had %was it within it?
the docks, the base railway marshalling yard, a main supply depot, a petrol
sub-depot, field bakery, and detailed issue depot. Cold storage was also 
available for rations such as sides of meat, etc --- of course, it is unlikely
that such nicities were available in the first days of the invasion, fresh
raitons weren't even available for quite some time. %cite graph in 27course

The BSA would then theoretically interface with the Line of Communication
Area (LofC).  These were railway networks or truck convoys that transported
stores from the BSA to the field army.  Now, the supply lines in Normandy were
quite short, measuring in the ones or tens of kilometers.  It was simply 
unnessessary to have a strict LofC area per se.  The field army could simply
draw stores directly from the BSA --- the LofC area really is not nessessary
until the field army is some distance away from the BSA.  The LofC would 
become nessessary as the British Army advanced through France and into 
Germany.  As they went deeper, scheduled and intensional convoys to convey
the stores would become more useful in relieving the field army of such 
transport network.  

In any case, regardless of whether the Army was drawing stores directly from 
the BSAs or from the LofC, eventually,  Army would have to start drawing
stores.  To such ends, the Army was divided into two sections the 
Corps / GHQ Area and the Divisional Area.  At the GHQ level, one begins to
see how the British Army sorted supplies.  POL and other stores were handled
in two theoretically seperate systems.  In either case, it is at the GHQ level
that stores were bulk broken.  

Let's handle the general stores first.  Stores are delivered to the Supply
Column (Sup Coln) where stores are bulk broken.  Think of this bulk breaking 
with the analogy of a grocery store.  A grocery store may recieve it's goods in 
wholesale, bulk form, but then repackage it into smaller, more usable units to
be easier to sell --- a retail customer may want 1 lb of almonds, not 1 ton
for example.  In the case of prepackaged stores, bulk breaking is more similar
to the procedure that occurs when a grocery store recieves a palette of cereal
which is subsequently unpacked and loaded as single units on a shelf.  Thus,
the Sup Coln HQ can function as an interface where the Army's bulk handling 
meets it's piece handing functions.\autocite[\SupInWar][3]{27course}

Likewise, fuel could, at times be shipped in bulk initially however fuel for
the British Army was never delievered to field units as such.  It was always
containerized first into tins.  There are fiew modern equivalents to this in
our modern world.  When we buy fuel at the petrol station, we pump it from a 
massive underground tank into our cars where it's sold by volume.  Rarely do
we buy a pre-packed can of fuel.  This was however how the British Army 
prefered to recieve it's fuel --- in 4 Gal (18L) of petrol per tin.\footnote
{\cite[\Petrol][3]{27course}.
For reference, the 2025 Toyota Corolla sedan has an approximately 50 l fuel 
tank whilst the 2025 Ford F150 Raptor pickup truck has a 136l tank.}%cite
These tins were nicknamed flimseys, and it was not an ironic term of affection. 
They were meant to be disposeable so they were built cheap; however, the 
design teams were perhaps overzelous.  The flimseys had an unfortunate habit
of breaking or leaking such that it was quite common for them to arrive 
damaged leading to fairly severe losses in fuel as well as a notable fire risk.  
Indeed, the flimseys were so bad that the Brtish Army began to simply use 
captured German (Jerry) petrol cans --- hence our modern term jerrycan 
(a German petrol can).  

Nevertheless, despite the questionable durability of flimsies, the British 
Army had some sound reasons for using containerized, as opposed to than bulk 
distribution.  Firstly, tanker lorries weren't nearly so common in 1940 as the 
are today.  Secondly,
containers are compartmentalized.  If a bullet percies a tanker lorry, one may
loose thousands of litres of fuel before one notices; hwoever, if a bullet 
travels through a containerized fuel transport (i.e. lorry full of flimseys),
one may loose only a few tins worth of fuel.  Moreover, containerized fuel has
far fewer mechanical requirements.  For bulk fueling to work, one must have a 
working petrol pump.  This could be quite inconvinient.  Imagine having a 
tankerload of fuel but no simple way to get the fuel out of the tanker.  
Moreover, using this system, you can only fuel a few viehicles at a time.  
With containerized fuel, one merely pulls up to the viehicles, unload a few
tins at each viehicle, and each crew then subsequently fuels their viehicle
with a cheap tin funnel.  Of course, this system was quite labourious to 
use but even so, it was judged by the British Army that the additional labour
was worth the cost.  % packaged at factory?

Having been bulk broken at the Corps or GHQ levels, it was now up to the 2nd
line transport units like 90 Coy to then bring those stores forward into the
Divisional areas and deliver them to the end-user units.  Depending on 
operational requirements, this may mean delivering it directly to the 
individual end-users, or it could mean delivering such stores to the units who 
could then further distribute stores internally.  This formed the basic, 
theoretical structure of the British Army's supply chain; however, just as how
no plan survives first contact with the enemy, the supply chain had to adapt
to tactical and oeprational nessessitites.  

Already, you may have noticed that the 27th Armoured Brigade is a 
\textit{brigade}.  Why does it have it's own 2nd line transport?  The answer
is fairly simple, 27th Armd Bde's full name was 27th Armoured Brigade 
(Armoured Assault). %e fact check
The Bde was raised as an independant armoured brigade for Overlord.  As such,
it needed a way to ensure it could run its own logistics.  You may also recall
how 90 Coy was, on D-Day, delivering both POL as well as ammunition to 27 Armd
Bde.  This shows how the supply chain had to remain flexible.  Whilst in 
theory, there was a seperate chain for POL and ammunition, in practice, this
was impossible.  This was the advantage of containerized fuel as fuel could 
simply be loaded into any available lorry.

Finally, before we carry on with the affairs of 90 Coy, it may be prudent to 
clarify what is meant by a `dump' and other forms of storage.  In a perfect 
world, supply chains would be perfectly efficient.  Ever single item required
by an army would be produced when it's needed, sent to where that item was 
required without delay, and used immediately on reciept.  Alas, hiccups 
invariably appear.  Shipping gets stalled, major operations consume unusally
large quantities of supplies, supplies are lost to enemy action, etc.  Thus,
to ensure first-line units recieve a continuous flow of supplies, it was ---
and remains --- nessessary to store a reasonable reserve of stores at various
points along the supply chain.  

Ideally, this would be a large, dry, flat, 
climate controlled warehouse with good transport networks, but alas, 
conditions in the field often are not always ideally suited to the 
logistician.  Thus, supplies were often stored by stacking supplies in a 
field or some woodland and covering them with tarpaulins if they required
protection from the weather.  The precise requirements of this may seem quite
trivial and not terribly important to the profession of fighting wars; however, 
seemingly trivial tasks such as labelling and organizing are critical.  
Consider what would happen if there was a German counter attack and the supply
officer could not find the 76mm anti-tank shells because their boxes were
not properly labelled or because the dump was not given enough land so that 
the aisles were too narrow.  Moreover, what would happen to those same shells 
if they were dropped and the packaging was inadequate to protect their contents
--- and honestly, who hasn't dropped a heavy box before.  Damage to the shell
casing could prevent the casing from ejecting properly after firing leading to
a stoppage and possibly leading to the tank being out of action.  

Consider also what would happen if one of these these dumps was attacked and
caught fire.  Aisles do not merely provide access but function as fire breaks.
These fire breaks are critical for hazardous material dumps such as POL dumps
or ammunition dumps.  When these dumps catch fire, it is often too dangerous
to attempt to extinguish the fire --- POL burns and High Explosives explode.
Instead, standard operating procedures tend to relate to contianing the fire
and letting it burn out on its own.  % insert medal citation example

This may seem small but how do acts like this win wars?  Unlike the combat 
arms, logistics does not win wars by plunging a bayonet into the hearts of the
enemy.   
Instead, logistics wins wars by ensuring the combat arms can act without 
restrictions.  If there is insufficient ammuniiton or fuel to support an 
advance, a General cannot order that advance.  If reserves are not ready when
the enemy attacks, then the combat arms will have few options but to withdraw
or fix bayonets.  
Logistics enables and constrains but achieves nothing on its own but by doing
so, is a significant factor in determining if an oepration is achievable or
foolhardy.  Let us return to Normandy in June of 1944 to see this in play.

% Point of operation  How do i want to manage this transition?  This is
% too abrupt

% THEME FOR 14TH:  Battle sustainment
% WngO (formal or informal) likely received for Goodwood 14th late morning or
% early afternoon.  90 Coy spends the afternoon organizing, then
% 14 Jul, over five hours (1700-2200), 90 Coy 
% converts the 13/18 rgmt amn & POL dumps IVO Ranville into dumps fit to 
% supply the Bde (likely approx 2 sq km in size).  
% dump consists of 38 lorry loads of amn to the 13/18th Rgmt dump enough
% to provide 97 rds/tk (a full load of amn) for the whole Bde.
% POL:  18 lorry loads of Pet & Derv (diesel) (7000 (either units or gal) of
% each).  This is enough POL to take the Bde 30 mi.  Coy does this via the BAD
% and PD.  Vehs fuelled as well before return to Coy HQ by 2400.  Speculate this
% was in receipt of WngO On 15th at 1900, Coy formally 
% establishes a det at the Ranville dumps to control R&I.  Det consists of 
% Capt Duffus, 46 ORs and 16 lorries.  Useful time to talk about fighting
% range and what it means.
%cite 90 Coy WD

% By the 15th, preparations for Goodwood occur in earnest across the Bde.  
% 3 Div holds another conference and, over the next few days, the Bde starts
% moving E of Orne likely via Ranville.  %cite 27th WD 15th Jul-ish
% Ranville det loads load 4 days compo into 6 lorries
% (enough to sustain whole Bde) as a mobile reserve.  8 lorries are devoted to
% keeping croc flamethrowers amned.  2 lorries leftover for odds and ends.
% Useful time to talk about importance of flexibility maybe?  
%cite 90 coy WD

% 16th:  RATIONS
% Bde HQ moves closer to Ranville but stays W of Orne.  Bde Cmdr holds 
% conference with Bde COs. %cite 27th WD
% As a result of this, all units W of Orne received 3 days extra compo, E of
% Orne, 4 days. %cite 90 WD
% Likely, whilst not stated in the WD, that 90 Coy made these regular 
% deliveries to the battalions.

% Total rations thus 4 days in vehicles, and 4 at 2nd line transport.  Ready 
% to move for 8 days.  Therefore, maximum planned speed for brigade's advance
% is approximately 30 mi (let's be realistic, likely 20 mi to account for 
% general movements) over 8 days by accounting for POL.  A good day of 
% advance would be 3.75 mi (6km)/day.  


% 17th:  Comms
% 27th HQ issues it's OpO for Goodwood today.  The Bde will help hold 8 Corps'
% left flank as 8 Corps breaks through.  Bde establishes it's battle net today.
%cite 27th WD and Orders
% 90 Coy receives two wireless lorries, one at Coy HQ, and 1 at the Ranville
% det.  Each lorry comes with 3 wireless ops.  %cite 90th WD
% Curiously, the OpO hardly mentions logistics.  Log is just expected to work.

% 18th:  D-day H-hr 0745

% loads to 45 loads of amn when the dump closes and the amn is brought back
% to BAD Hermanville. %cite 90th WD for 25 Jul

% If Goodwood failed to break out, it wasn't logistical constraints.
\section{Post Goodwood}

% use it as a chance to talk about infantry transport --- Br infantry don't 
% have organic transport.  Also how more normal RASC transport units work

% 22nd, the Bde is informed they'll be broken up.  They get assigned to 
% 2nd Army's 22 Transport Coln at months end.  
% Det Ranville shrinks by 45 lorry loads of amn
% and the coy moves to Camilly (GR 933704).  Det Ranville is handed over to 
% different unit and rejoins the Coy.  Coy provides transport to Staff Yeo
% to Arromaches docks.  Coy returns the 2nd line amn holding of 30x 3ton 
% truckloads and 27 6-ton loads to BAD.  %cite 90 WD p.7 mention this holding
% earlier on too.

\section{} %not sure what to call it, something about being an ordinary
% 2nd line RASC unit


\section{Criticality of Supply}

% Ask the question of what would happen if not for these activities. 
	% Amn
	% Beans
	% Water (note location of WP)
	% POL
	% Everything else (white paint for turrets lest one gets shot lol)

% Invite community to see an army as a system and merely disconnected fighting
% groups.

% Discuss my gaps, I barely touch on maintenance units, etc.  What I could
% have talked about, what other sources say.  Consider Tiger or Panther without
% Maint units

% talk about sources, how 90 Coy WD doesn't really mention resupplies unless
% it's major, but just because it's not written, doesn't mean it wasn't done.
% by asking the question of who would do X, one starts to uncover the Y, and Z.
% talk about how entries like 6 Jun are very long --- likely because of the
% initial excitement.  The WD's progressively shorter and more concise as time
% wares on, likely because it's tedious and, "I want to go to bed!".  Supply
% logs are tedious.  Talk about how this study is actually quite constrained
% by sources in so far as a heavy dependence on electronic sources.  War diaries
% don't mention routine replenishments but it doesn't mean they don't happen.
% alas, I doubt they kept the waybills!
