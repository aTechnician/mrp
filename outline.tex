% Conops, perhaps use a narrative flow moving from before invasion for the
% prepwork and training, to the actual invasion for execution and adaptation,
% to transition around or after TOTALIZE?

% TLDR:  if you accept that the British CA soldier was tactically worse than
% teh Germans but were able to defeat the Gemrans by unloading an ungodly
% amout of steel and expolosives over their head at the first sign of 
% difficulty, then the british logistial soldier was far superior.  A war 
% cannot be won by killing alone!

% CONOPS:  What if I do this as a microhistory of 90 Coy?  I can use them as 
% a way to talk about the criticallity of logistics.  What if I used them as
% the pivot around which an army (tbh, 27 Armd Bde, and 3 Div) can turn?  I 
% can use it to skirt around the wider issue that I don't have evidecne for
% a macro view but I have 90 Coys WD.  Alas, I can't find as many decorations
% for them as I would like to really make it personal.  Could I use examples 
% from other units as a `take Cpl Bloggins from X, note the work he did'?
% time to run git branch I suppose.  It also allows me to be narrative which
% is always fun.  Their 4 day history was already 7 pages, I could breath life
% into.  I can harp on about them for 8-10 x that, right? 1-2 pages 
% intoducing (let's do it as if they hit a beach and they're driving a 
% convoy up the road to Benouville with that preload of supplies for 6 Airborn
% whence we pause to discuss what we currently talk about in the 
% historiography.   I have 5-10 pages on what other people have been writing 
% about Normandy, from there, perhaps another 5ish to narrow down on Sword 
% Beach, the whys, the objectives, who was involved etc. --- I shoudl re-read
% return of martin guerre I think.  

	% so 20pgs here, I'll probably do more once I footnote it all.
% With this context, we return to the convoy and lay out the theretical 
% framework by which logistics operates.  Depots, lengths of supply lines,
% how distribution happens, etc.  How this work integrates with the rest of
% the army.  We deliver the supplies and talk about the RV.  Let's also start
% talking about the arduous work over the next few days to supply 3 Div and 
% 27th bde as there are no other 2nd line transport units.  As we continue 
% here, I can interesect the sources for 27th Armoured Bde to give context
% as to what 90 Coy was doing.  I suppose I"ll have to do soem probablies and
% perhapses.  We can talk about how 90 Coy supported the Bde until the Bde was
% disbanded.  Then, continue talking about how the Coy supported other units
% till Totalize maybe?  Then, have a final almost pre-conclusion discussing
		% Perhaps this takes 4-6 pagesish?
% how, whilst we don't write about it, these oprations would have been 
% impossible without the supporting arms and concluding with how the British
% ability to have tacitical mediocraty and an unwillingness to spend lives
% meant that their logistics had to be good, really good.  Mmbe this would 
% work? 

\section{Introduction}

	%Estimate 2-3 pgs?

	% Set scene, we're in Normandy, 6 [time] Jun 44, we just landed, we're
	% driving from Queen Beach to Benouville to link up with 6 Abrn.  
	% you're X lorries are carrying preloads of ammunition, rations, and
	% other supplies for 6 Abrn.  They're holding the Anglo-American 
	% left flank from a possible German counter attack.  what if I put
	% it in the perspective of that Lt who did the initial recce?  YOu 
	% weren't originally scheduled to land yet but an accdient of war
	% means here you are.  Describe more about what 6 Airborne is doing
	% you don't belong to 6 Airborn but are instead of 27 bde, you're 
	% just taksed to help them on D day, their unit 2nd line unit will
	% arrive from Juno later /* Come back to this when discussing import */

	% THESIS
	% You know what you're doing is important, without these supplies and 
	% the war will ground to a halt.  

	% You wonder what the historians who write about these events 80 years 
	% in the future will think about it all, what drives your focus?

	% Maybe have a bitter reflection, it's always teh fighting troops or
	% the generals who get the cheers.  No-one appauds the cooks!  Use
	% the perhapses of history for this

	% Segue to historiographical review?

	\subsection{Clarification of Terms}
		% How I use D-Day to actually mean D Day and not 6 Jun 44

\section{Historiographical Review}

	% `Of course we know that 80 years after the fact, historians...'

	% Complain loudly and long-windedly at the lack of discussion on log 
	% in /*insert list */  Consider subsections or flow of text?

	% Discuss the current logistical scholarship done
		% Namely historical work in 50s and Supplying War, Julian
		% Thompson, Great Feat...

	% Introduce Section

	% General observations:
		% Much work done on great men, tactics, the merits of German
		% Armour; and some work has been done on American logistics,
		% as well as logistical peculiarities like the mulberry 
		% harbours.  I fear little has been done on the actual
		% military administration of the war.  Indeed, the logistical
		% section of military history is fairly poorly written about
		% by hisotrians, some more work done military acadamies
		% reflecting its importance to them
	\subsection{On WW2} % there's got to be a better name than this
		\subsubsection{\textit{Britian's Other Army:  The Story of
			the ATS}}
			% This feels kinda awkward to put here
		\subsubsection{\textit{Why the Allies Won}}

	\subsection{On Normandy}
% reorder this, chrono flow or based on argument?

% really flesh out the common critiques and defences of the British Army, 
% that it was slow to develop, under manned, unimaginative, morale problems,
% materiel over lives

		\subsubsection{\textit{Clash of Arms}}
			% Argues that the British were slow and failed in
			% innovating.

			% Toss this in Normandy or Log?

	\subsection{On Logistics}
% reorder this

%% Do I wanna put the books for WW2 logistics here or in WW2?  I'm tempted
% to concentrate it here but I also like the idea of keeping something from
% the field of military science and not history seperate --- military science
% cares much more on actually executing operations.  Split this into two 
% subsubs and make the rest subsubsubs?  One for hisotry, one for less so?
% Could also compress, maybe compressing and not sectioning this section 
% will flow better.  In any case, I wonder if it's better to chk pg ct

		\subsubsection{\textit{Supplying War:  Logistics from
			Wallenstine to Patton}}
			% Foundational in logistics scholarship, but, given
			% it's broad scope, it lacks depth
		\subsubsection{\textit{The Lifeblood of War: Logistics in
			Armed Conflict}}
			% Limited and tries to cover a lot of periods
		\subsubsection{\textit{A Great Feat of Improvisation}}
			% British but only really to shortly after Dunkirk

	\subsection{Tools of the Trade} % maybe rename this

	% The historiographical Gap.  Introduce an inattentiveness to log
	% here, that the materiel advantage is contingent on getting this
	% right.
	
	\subsection{A Note on My Sources}
		
		% Heavy reliance on digital records

		% paper records from Canadian sources owing to funding but
		% argue for the soundness of the methodology anyways given
		% how Canadian stuff is of Br doctrine

% Start with Context %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{WTF are we doing here!?} % rename this

	% We return to our convoy, you're thinking and a bit day-dreamy 
	% driving through the French countryside thinking about the 
	% magnitude of what you're acutally doing.  DO I want to go this
	% tone??

	% Overlord & Neptune:  Mission, invade France, push the Germans
	% across the rhine sooner or later

	% Division of beaches, start from the W and move E.  How beaches
	% are subdivided.  Start thinking about the beach exits maybe and
	% why they matter?  Maybe reflect on the massive traffic jams?

	% Talk about the 'bloody army', Q branch, A branch, and G branch.

\section{} % move to Hermanville, 90 coy's control point in running convoys

	% Talk about how supply works, the DIDs, supply lines, POL differences

	% complaint about the flimsies and containerized fuel

	% talk about how you sustain client units, march length, the end goal
	% of ending the day with filled tanks, full ammo, etc.

	% Keep that story telling feeling, you're at the control point mourning
	% the fact that there are no other second line units, you're vastly 
	% overworked.  If only you had the additional units to support you.
	% if only ____ instead, you're left trying to maintins [sustainment
	% standards] and just keep what's needed flowing as hard as you can.

	{Logistics Working Practices in Theory}

	% Use to establish what we're actually dealing with so importance
	% becomes self-evident
	
	% How supply chains work from dumps, and depots, to distribution, to
	% 1st line units.  

	% ``The principle of supply is that field units should always have
	% with them, or within reach, two days' rations and forage, and one 
	% iron ration, and that these stocks should be replenished by 
	% delivery, at a point within reach of the troops, of one day's ration
	% and forage each day.'' %cite No27 Trg Course p. 32, quoted in,
	% refs F.S.R. Vol. I. Sec107(I). %validate this

	% Key was placed on  on rabild concentration of force, incl sup, LofC
	% etc. to permit strategic use of force %cite 27 trg crs p. 32

	\subsection{The Structure of Supply}
		
		% 4 main areas, the BSA, L of C, Corps/GHQ area, Div area
		% goes from 

		%cite No 27 Trg Course p. 34ish (diagram's on 34)
		\subsubsection{The Base Supply-Area (BSA)}
			% The Docks
				% Bulk Petorl
				% Cold STorage

			% Main Supply Depot --- Field Bakery, DID

			% Petorl Sub Depot 

			% Base Marhsalling Yard (start of railway line)

		\subsubsection{L of C Area}

			% Einvisioned as a railway line, lorries will do 
			% just fine but this theory came at the dawn of
			% mechanization.  Point was to take stores from
			% the BSA and transport them near the combat zone.
			% It's basically a transprot area.  IT goes from 
			% just outside the BSA to, and including the railhead.

			% If distance from the BSA to the railhead is < 12
			% hr trip, BSA will control.  Else, there will be
			% a regulating station around 6 hrs from the rail
			% head. %cite no27 Winter Trg p. 32 5c
			
			% The railheads also had field supply depots, to
			% supply local resources.
			
			% If using trucks, it's 150 tons per 21 trucks with
			% old pat, 59 tonns across 12 trucks (5 supplies, 2 
			% ord, 2 R E, 2 stores, 1 RAMC)  railway trucks 
			% %cite No 27 course, p. 32 para 5

		\subsubsection{Corps or GHQ Area}

			% Start of what really starts to feel like the
			% field army and not just transport areas.
			% Transprt at thsi point is by road.

			% Seperate Chain for 'stuff' and POL.  POL is the
			% Coprs Petrol Park (25 Mi for Div, 75 mi for C.T)
			% Explain the logic of this.  POL used containerized
			% distribution rather than tankers for end-point
			% distriubtion.  Used flimsies or jerrycans

			% Supply Coln. HQ handles the rest of it.  Here, 
			% stores are bulk broken and sent further forward.

		\subsubsection{Div Area}
			
			% POL side, POL is held at the Div Petrol Coy 
			% and should have a 50 mi. supply (chk this).  
			% The div Pet Coy will set up petrol points and
			% unit transport will collect POL from those points.

			% General Supplies are handled at a rondezvous 
			% where supplies will be delivered at delivery 
			% points via meeting points.  Range from the L of C
			% area to the DPs is 30-40 mi.  DPs are where 
			% individual units come to collect stores.
	

	\subsection{Warehousing}

		% Especially in those early weeks when a lot of it was dumping
		% rather than warehousing per-se.  

		% DID (maybe??) 3000 Tons/acre= gross stacking area.  x 4-10
		% for expansion %cite No 27 trg 32 (this might be a general
		% rule too)

		\subsubsection{Base Supply Depots}
			% Located near Base Marshalling Yard, outside docks
			% to permit expansion and dispersion.  Consider `water
			% light, telephones, good roads, office accomodation'
			% when selecting the location. Area = Strength X 
			% stock X weight one ration / (unintelligable) = 
			% 8.5 sq ft /ton = stacking 
			% +50\% for stock spacing = gross stacking area X 4
			% to 10 for expansion, etc.  (that's a quote)
			%cite 27 trg course p.32, 4
	% zoom out a little and talk about what you'll be controlling.
	

/* Figure out where to incorporate the fact that the British/Canadians focused
on firepower over manpower.  This means materiel is critical --- A is for ammo,
B is for beans, C cold water, D: deisil, E-everything else... */

/* Do I want to expand to include things like traffic control?  Traffic jams
on Sword Beach may have made the Br fail to capture Caen on D.  10m of dry
beach between water and sea wall at high tide.  Perhaps an MP or two would
have solved the issue. IIRC, RAF beach sqn dealt with it. (See
RAF beach sqn/det  Was this a critcal
oversight?  Not a lack of tenacity or anything else, but a good, old fasioned
traffic jam vis-a-vis Toronto at rush-hour caused the failure to take Caen?
lol --- what a way to win a war! */

\section{Reutrn to the moment} 
%New title, want to get back to what 90 Coy was up to till D+7
% summ up the Jun Hist Rep for 90 Coy 

\section{Operation } %name, if any?  Was hasty operation.  
% Maybe just consolodations?  Oh, how about the Dumps at Ranville

% give context for the situation IVO ranville at the time.  British holding
% several KM^2 E of the Orn at IVO Ranville.  This land was supplied from main
% beaches over the Benouville-Ranville bridges.  Single point of failure.

% part of wider fears of a German counter attack.  
%cite 7 para jun WD appendix p. 5
% 90 Coy established a dump using 12x 3tonners.  Maintly Amn & POL, started
% 12 1800 Jun 44.  Incrases to 20x lorries next day (how many lorries in 
% a coy again?)
% dump at Ranville (1173) %cite 90 coy wd 12 Jun 
% Do I wanna mention decorations here for 90 Coy or maybe do it earlier
% IVO Ranville.  Positioning of this dump wise.  Only route to supply troops
% E of Orne and canal is via Benouville/ranville bridges.  This would permit
% bridgehead to keep fighting if the bridges were destroyed.  Infantry armour
% co-operation was a noted problem.  6 tks KO.  Paras take 40 prisoners, 0 KIA,
% 9 Wounded. 
%cite 7 para jun WD appendix p. 6


% Highlight that prepairation is key.  If there was a counter attack and the
% bridge was blown, gallentry matters naught if you aren't supplied.  What 
% will you do, fix bayonettes --- well, yes acutually...?
% C Pl 90 Coy continue to provide light support till 16 Jun

\section{The Arrivals of A \& B Plns}
% non critical section, setting the tone of a lull.  A/B Pl arrive 
% 15 2000 Jun 44.  Go to Coy HQ in Cresserons GR 0379.  Brings with them 
% 59 Veh, 165 Pers.  Arrives 2300 hrs. Some DE bombing.  Over the next 3 days,
% new platoons involved in dewatering and reorganising in prep for ops.  
% sporadic bombing and shelling of veh pk.  Veh dispersed 75 yds between 
% each veh --- quite exposed with no protection then (they're in an open 
% field).  

% Queen Beach still being shelled
% Generally fairly quiet for Bde till end of month %cite 27 Armd Bde WD
% quiet for 90 Coy until 23 Jun %cite WD

% Maybe talk about the perhapses?  Amn sitll was consumed, as was POL, in 
% addition, what about general transport of rations, etc.  I don't have
% a src, but these must have happened.

% Talk about that wonderfully dull stuff like stove and flour shortages in
% the 27th Bde WD Admin instructions (and deficate in the latrines!).  
% Also, traffic flow patterns, spare parts, uniforms, water points etc.
% Highlight the importance of the ordinary and mundane. 

\section{Operation Mitten 27--28 June 1944}

% Want to shwo that operations impossible without such units.  Focus on what
% worked, not what didn't work for the british.  British tanks bad, arty good.
% this is a useful moment to talk about the nature of Br Arty.

% Objective (no idea TBH, check 27th Bde WD) TLDR form google search,
% eliminate a DE salient at a chateaux not on my map IVO GR 0372

% 90 Coy's Work

% 30x 3Ton loads of 105mm amn held on wheels for 3 br div on 23 Jun.  
% Likely for M7 Priest.  Should clarify, this isn't 90 tons but 30 
% truckloads. wonder if I can find out how many 105mm shells a 3 tonner can 
% load onto it.  Does it volume out or weight out?  Emphisize that 90 Coy
% was only helping this unit.  Technically, as the 27th Bde unit, they 
% don't do arty stuff.

% Amn is delivered 26 Jun to batteries located IVO GR 0378, it's D-1.

% don't forget about the stuff for flamethrowers!!

	\subsection{British Artillery} % amn consumption in barrage, arty
		% usage, etc.  Show just hwo dependant the Br were with
		% arty.  Maybe get the mass of a 105 shell and propellant?
		% there's no way to get an accurate estimate though, if
		% only they were 25 pdrs...

	\subsection{Support to Operations}
		% Operation used flamethrower tanks from 141 RAC (Chruchill
		% Crocodiles)  Needed special fuel and nitrogen cylendars.
		
		% Coy sets up dump of 3000 Gal (13640L) of fuel and 90 N cyl
		% at Gazell (GR 0276) on 27th, withdrawn on 29th.

		% D+1, Maint Point set up at Le Vey (GR976757) distributing
		% 2400 Gal of FTF.  

		% D+1 for Staffs Yeo, 0300, 1082 rds 75mm HE delivered, 
		% 600 rds at 1600 hrs, 1200 rds at 2000 hrs delivered --- what
		% where the Staffs doing?  Find out  Also for context, give
		% amn capacity of tank  

		% in Op Inst No 2 for 27th Bde (28 Jun 44) sqn shoots limited
		% to 50 rds/gun.  Tanks were to harrass Germans as long as 
		% Br infantry weren't harmed by this fire and the tanks move
		% as soon as counterbattery fire is encountered
		%cite 27th Armd Bde WD, Jun 44 p12
		

	\subsection{Figure out a name} %rename
		% conclude this section maybe this doesn't actually need a 
		% subsection.  This much work was needed for a simple 2 day
		% operation.  WOrk vital but it was doable.  Sum it back up.
		% Maybe the tanks weren't the best, but their inadequecies were
		% floated by a supply chain that kept up so that they could be
		% bad but still effective.

\section{Operation Aberlour}
% Never took place, do I wanna talk about it?  Issued 27 Jun 44.  A lot of 
% admin stuff for 90 coy like amn dumps, etc.  (Cite p26 27th WD for Jun)
% more on p30.  I almost like the idea of talking about an op that never
% takes place.  It eliminates the fog that arises from what happens when
% there's contact made with emy.  Here we can focus on how operations
% take place.  Hmm...
