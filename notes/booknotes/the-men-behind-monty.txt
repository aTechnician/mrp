Monty Brings with him from 8th Army to 21AG his 
COS, Admin O, RAC O, IntO, 2 ADCs, his Canadian LO, mess Sgt, Car driver, 
jeep driver, batman, COS's SM.

Also wanted SigO, Q(Maint), padre, BGS(OPS), GSO1(ops), GSO1(Air) 

Perhaps discuss the general staff system X how we mostly talk about G Branch 
best not Q or A branches. 

132 Monty used a 3 HQs system. TAC HQ, Main HQ, & rear HQ. 
Main HQ houses G staff mostly whilst near the
Q plans and Maint were at main HQ theory as they sustain the fighting 

145 On phase lies.  Very top heavy

165 Port-en-Bessin captured a port for vessels drawing up to 14'.  Mixed
cargo started on D+5 and bulk petrol on D + 19

166 Field artillery ammo quite short.  Tanks and AA ammo was well supplied 
owing to the lower than expected expenditure of ammunition.  Good reserve
of POL.

Book largely overlooks logistics
