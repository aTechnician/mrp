General notes

51 32 rds/gun/limber

65  A brief note on supply, namely, that the RASC handled transport of 
ammunition and other stores.  Little else.  Though it does say “without 
ammunition, no artillery fire”.  Though battery ammunition detachments would 
handle such affairs.

72  Supply used 3 ton lorries for transport, jeeps, and 15 cwt 4x4 were also 
used for light transport.  

118-8  Location of ammo dumps

140 Logistics was a major challenge that could take days to stockpile but how 
was this done?

122-3 Stock piling could be done through the night 500-600 rds per operation

125 First hand ammo was organic but additional ammo to the order of 500-600 
shells per gun may also be needed and 1 week  to stockpile

132 Ineffective WW1 bombardments, keeping heads down
133 obliterating a football field

147  5% of shells fell within 100x100 yard grid for predicted fire
